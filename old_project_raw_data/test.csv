"'Wicked' soars with $114 million domestic opening, 'Gladiator' snares $55.5 million","The box office was a popular destination this weekend as Universal's ""Wicked"" and Paramount's ""Gladiator II"" arrived in cinemas.

""Wicked"" is expected to snare $114 million during its domestic opening, the highest debut of a Broadway adaptation in cinematic history, according to Sunday estimates. Globally the film is set to take in $164.2 million.

Tracking projections for ""Wicked"" started around $80 million in late October, but rose to a range of $120 million to $140 million. Hollywood has struggled to market and make a profit on movie musicals in recent years. However, the industry has also seen fan-favorite IP-driven titles outperform. With ""Wicked"" being based on one of Broadway's most popular musicals, box-office analysts found it tricky to predict where it would land.

However, at its $114 million tally, the film will earn the third-highest domestic opening of 2024 behind Disney and Marvel's ""Deadpool & Wolverine,"" which took in $211 million in July, and Disney and Pixar's ""Inside Out 2,"" which grabbed $151 million in June.

Meanwhile, ""Gladiator II"" is expected to open with $55.5 million in ticket sales domestically, according to Sunday estimates. This is lower than box office expectations, which called for a haul between $60 million and $80 million. Globally, the film is set to reach $221 million by the end of the weekend, after opening in international locations earlier this month.

""As arguably the most talked about weekend of 2024, this $200 million plus pre-Thanksgiving frame has delivered big with the one-two punch of 'Wicked' and 'Gladiator II' serving up a perfectly orchestrated, irresistible moviegoing combination with appeal to basically every demographic on the planet,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore.

Although ""Glicked"" did not quite reach the same level as last year's ""Barbenheimer,"" the combo of Universal's ""Oppenheimer"" and Warner Bros.' ""Barbie,"" this weekend's tally will help bolster the overall annual box office, which lags around 11% behind 2023 levels during the same period. Both films are expected to continue to drive ticket sales at theaters through Thanksgiving and Christmas.

""Once again, it's clear that when healthy competition meets premium experiences, the marketplace thrives, and consumers win,"" said Michael O'Leary, president and CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners. "" The success of movies like 'Wicked' and 'Gladiator II,' not to mention hearty presales already for 'Moana 2,' demonstrates just how much movie fans of all ages enjoy going to the movies.""

Disney's ""Moana 2"" is expected to haul in $100 million over the five-day Thanksgiving period, according to box office analysts.",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/24/wicked-soars-with-114-million-domestic-opening-gladiator-snares-55point5-million.html,2024-11-24 16:30:28+00:00
6 things we’re watching in the stock market in the holiday-shortened trading week ahead,"The S&P 500 made a clean sweep, closing higher every day last week.",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/24/6-things-cramers-investing-club-is-watching-in-stock-market-in-week-ahead.html,2024-11-24 15:09:24+00:00
'We were willing to risk everything': Gen-Z duo started a pasta sauce brand that brings in $1 million a month,"To hear Troy Bonde and Winston Alfieri tell it, they never would've become so successful if they'd been smarter.

That's because the pair — who last year launched Sauz, a jarred pasta sauce popular with Gen Z that now retails nationwide — got their start in business in 2020 by doing the unthinkable: wiring $9,000 to a person in China who they had never met before and only spoken to on WhatsApp.

USC students at the time, Los Angeles natives Bonde and Alfieri had been sent home after Covid shut down in-person learning. Just 21 and 20, the pair saw a business opportunity amid their stay-at-home boredom.

""We sat down together and thought 'What problem can we solve?'"" Bonde tells CNBC Make It. ""And in thinking about going back to a classroom with 200 students where people are using thermometer guns, sanitizing their hands and handing out masks, [we asked ourselves] is there any way we can speed up that process?""

They reached out to a medical manufacturer in China with their idea for a combination device that could dispense sanitizer and take your temperature same time and learned that the manufacturer already had one in production.

They got a sample of the product and cold emailed a local California school district to pitch and demo it to them. Soon, Bonde and Alfieri had a purchase order for nearly $20,000 worth of devices. The college students borrowed $9,000 from their parents to send to their Chinese manufacturer.

Bonde calls the decision ""the beauty of being naïve as an early stage founder,"" while Alfieri describes it as ""the scariest moment of our lives.""

""Today, I would never wire nine grand to a manufacturer in China that I'd never spoken to,"" Bonde says. ""But we did it. And a week and a half later we had two pallets land on my parents' front door.""

The business, which they called NextPace Ventures, ""scaled really quickly,"" eventually landing clients as big as Best Western.

""Honestly, it was the craziest business in the world,"" Bonde says. ""We had no marketing expenses. We had no employees. We had no accounting department. There was no formality and no budget. It was six months of just huge, huge growth. But after three months of scale we knew revenues weren't going to continue to grow at the rate that they were and they were actually going to significantly fall.""

To find their next venture, Bonde and Alfieri looked no further than their pantry.

A Sauz is born

While working on NextPace Ventures, the pair spent most of their nights sleeping in Alfieri's dad's office. To fuel their long days of cold emailing prospective clients, they'd cook the classic college student meal of pasta with jarred sauce.

During visits to their local Whole Foods, the duo noticed brands like Olipop and Poppi making waves in the beverage aisle with bright, colorful packaging. That kind of energy, they thought, was missing from the pasta sauce aisle.

""We felt like pasta was the lowest hanging fruit with the largest addressable market and opportunity,"" Bonde says. ""And we enjoyed it. It was something that we knew was going to be a lot of fun to do.""

They decided to take the profit they made from their first venture and use it to start the brand that would become Sauz.

""We probably took $150,000 — everything we made from that business, honestly, bottom line — and put it into Sauz,"" Bonde says. ""We were totally willing to risk everything.""

To stack additional cash, Alfieri sold his Ford truck while Bonde parted with his Mazda Miata.

At the time, Bonde was interning at an investment bank while Alfieri was an intern at a real estate firm. Their parents, they say, ""were thrilled"" about their sons getting private school degrees and going into conventional careers. Breaking the news to their families that they wouldn't be following that plan wasn't easy.

""To tell our parents that we were going to sell pasta sauce for a living was the craziest conversation we ever had to break to family,"" Bonde says.

Even friends weren't supportive at the time, he says: ""We knew people were laughing behind our backs.""

""One of our buddies, who actually is now an investor in the company, told us 'I thought you guys were so stupid for starting this,'"" Alfieri added.

They spent most of the money hiring a food scientist to develop their sauces and a marketing and design agency to create colorful and vibrant packaging that would help them stand out from the pack.

Choosing flavors was another gamble. The pasta sauce aisle was crammed with basil marinaras, vodkas and creamy alfredos. Alfieri and Bonde wanted to do something different.

They had noted with interest the rise of Mike's Hot Honey and how the spicy and sweet topping had become ubiquitous in pizza shops around the country. Maybe shoppers would enjoy the flavor in their pasta sauce.

""We wanted to trust our guts,"" Bonde says. ""If I went and surveyed 1,000 pasta sauce shoppers, I don't think any of them would have said hot honey marinara. They'd never seen it. I don't think a consumer knew they wanted it because they'd never had the opportunity to try it or buy it or think of it.""

They decided on Hot Honey Marinara and Summer Lemon Marinara as Sauz's first two flavors, confident that shoppers would be as excited about them as they were. They pitched their product to Erewhon, not expecting to hear back from the boutique LA grocery chain.

Calling it ""the place to see and be seen"" for consumer packaged goods brands, Bonde and Alfieri say they were surprised when an Erewhon buyer responded to their pitch and requested samples. Within two weeks, they were authorized for sale in the store.

There was just one problem: they didn't have any product.

""We had sent samples that had been cooked in our R&D facility. We [weren't even] ready to produce,"" Bonde says. ""It probably took eight months or a year between when we were approved for Erewhon and when we actually launched.""

""Securing tomatoes was one of the hardest things,"" Alfieri explains. ""All these other conglomerate brands were contracting these tomatoes for years because of COVID. We were trying to get a little sliver to make 4,000 jars.""

The brand officially launched in Erewhon in July 2023. In January 2024, it started expanding to more retailers, eventually landing in Whole Foods this May. In July, it debuted at Target, creating a national footprint for the young brand and its 25- and 24-year-old founders.

Sauz's flavor lineup now includes Creamy Calabrian Vodka and Wild Rosemary Marinara. The brand, which has worked to acquire customers through fun and irreverent posts on TikTok and Instagram, now brings in nearly $1 million per month selling jars that generally retail between $8 to $10, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.

And while they're no longer selling thermometers to school districts, Alfieri and Bonde are grateful for their brief foray into medical device sales.

""Without that last business,"" Bonde says, ""there really is no Sauz.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/24/gen-z-founders-risked-everything-to-create-million-dollar-pasta-sauce.html,2024-11-24 15:00:01+00:00
"Millennials say they plan to spend big this holiday season — 'I see a lot of optimism,' expert says","Parents tend to splurge on their children during the holidays.

This year, 63% of millennials, many of whom now have school-age children of their own, said they plan to spend the same or more on holiday shopping as they did last year — the highest share of any generation, according to a quarterly report by TransUnion.

Millennials are also more likely to say their income went up over the last few months and that they expect their earnings potential to increase again in the year ahead. TransUnion polled 3,000 adults in October.

""I see a lot of optimism going into the holiday season,"" said Charlie Wise, TransUnion's senior vice president and head of global research and consulting.

For many in this group, recent wage gains have outpaced rising prices and, although the broader unemployment rate has ticked higher, ""we are still seeing a steady employment situation,"" Wise said. ""When people have jobs, that confidence is going to translate into spending.""

""It's clear that millennials will play the largest role this holiday shopping season with the greatest expected spend,"" Wise said.

Holiday spending between Nov. 1 and Dec. 31 is forecast to increase to a record total of $979.5 billion to $989 billion, according to the National Retail Federation.

Even as credit card debt tops $1.17 trillion, holiday shoppers expect to spend, on average, $1,778, up 8% compared with last year, Deloitte's holiday retail survey found.

Meanwhile, 28% of holiday shoppers surveyed in September said they still had not paid off the gifts they purchased for their loved ones last year, according to a holiday spending report by NerdWallet, which polled more than 1,700 adults.

Holiday spending may lead to holiday debt

While most shoppers — 74% — use credit cards to buy holiday gifts, 28% will dip into savings to make their purchases, and 16% will lean on buy now, pay later services, NerdWallet found. Survey respondents could choose multiple payment methods.

Buy now, pay later is one of the fastest-growing categories in consumer finance and is expected to become more popular in the weeks ahead, according to the most recent data from Adobe. Adobe forecasts buy now, pay later spending will peak on Cyber Monday with a new single-day record of $993 million.

However, managing multiple buy now, pay later loans with different payment dates may make it more likely for consumers to get in over their heads, some experts have cautioned — even more than with credit cards, which are simpler to account for, despite sky-high interest rates.

Sometimes, the option to pay in installments can make financial sense, especially at 0% interest, according to Marshall Lux, a senior fellow at the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at the Harvard Kennedy School.

""If used properly, it's great,"" Lux said.

""But a lot of people are going to spread out purchases over a longer period of time and then you get into high interest and a cycle of debt,"" he said.

The more buy now, pay later accounts consumers have open at once, the more prone they become to overspending, missed or late payments and poor credit history, other research shows.

If a consumer misses a payment, there could be late fees, deferred interest or other penalties, depending on the lender. In some cases, those interest rates can be as high as 30%, rivaling the highest credit card charges.",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/24/millennials-will-spend-big-this-holiday-season-transunion-finds.html,2024-11-24 14:00:01+00:00
Top Wall Street analysts are bullish on these dividend stocks,"With the Federal Reserve now on a rate-cutting campaign, dividend stocks may soon get their moment in the spotlight.

Investors looking for lucrative dividend-paying stocks can track the recommendations of top analysts, who consider various aspects like a company's fundamentals and consistency in dividend payments before selecting a stock.

Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros on TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

Exxon Mobil

This week's first dividend pick is oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil (XOM). The company recently announced better-than-anticipated third-quarter results, driven by a solid rise in production. It is worth noting that the company achieved its highest liquids production in over 40 years with 3.2 million barrels per day.

The dividend aristocrat returned $9.8 billion to shareholders in the third quarter. Moreover, the company increased its quarterly dividend by 4% to 99 cents per share. With this hike, Exxon has increased its dividends for 42 consecutive years. XOM stock offers a forward dividend yield of 3.3%.

Following the Q3 print, Evercore analyst Stephen Richardson reiterated a buy rating on Exxon stock with a price target of $135. The analyst noted that the company's strategy to invest through the cycle trough and boost spending on major projects and acquisitions like that of Pioneer Natural Resources boosted the prospects of its Upstream business.

""The benefit of incremental investments and perhaps more importantly the high grading of the asset base has put XOM on a different competitive footing vs. the industry but also vs. its own historical results,"" said Richardson.

The analyst noted that the company's cash flow from operations, excluding working capital changes, of $15.2 billion was flat on a quarter-over-quarter basis but exceeded his expectations by nearly $1.1 billion. He also highlighted that Exxon's net debt declined by $1.1 billion in the quarter, reflecting $2.3 billion of net working capital inflow.

Richardson ranks No. 924 among more than 9,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 61% of the time, delivering an average return of 9.6%. See Exxon Ownership Structure on TipRanks.

Coterra Energy

We move to another energy player, Coterra Energy (CTRA). It is an exploration and production company with operations focused in the Permian Basin, Marcellus Shale and Anadarko Basin. In the third quarter, shareholder returns represented 96% of the company's free cash flow (FCF) and included a quarterly base dividend of 21 cents per share and share repurchases worth $111 million.

Coterra Energy aims to return 50% or greater of its annual FCF to shareholders and recently highlighted that it has returned 100% year to date. CTRA stock offers a dividend yield of 3%.

On Nov. 13, Coterra announced two separate definitive agreements to acquire certain assets of Franklin Mountain Energy and Avant Natural Resources and its affiliates for a total amount of $3.95 billion. The company thinks that the acquisition of these two Permian Basin asset packages will expand its core area in New Mexico and boost its organizational strengths.

Reacting to the news, Mizuho analyst Nitin Kumar reaffirmed a buy rating on the stock with a price target of $37 and a ""Top Pick"" designation. He said that while the assets being acquired are less attractive than Coterra's existing Permian inventory on the basis of pure well productivity, their higher oil mix and lower well costs offset this shortcoming.

While Kumar thinks that these acquisitions are not transformative, he remains bullish on CTRA's long-term prospects and thinks that ""as the lowest-cost producer of gas, CTRA should be able to support above-peer cash generation even at lower prices or wide differentials, which complement oil-driven FCF from the Permian.""

Kumar ranks No. 187 among more than 9,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 14.3%. See Coterra Energy Stock Charts on TipRanks.

Walmart

Finally, let's look at Walmart (WMT). The big-box retailer delivered impressive third-quarter results and raised its full-year guidance, thanks to the strength in its e-commerce business and improvement in categories beyond groceries.

Earlier this year, Walmart raised its annual dividend per share by about 9% to 83 cents per share, marking the 51st consecutive year of dividend increases.

Following the results, Jefferies analyst Corey Tarlowe increased the price target for WMT stock to $105 from $100 and reaffirmed a buy rating. The analyst noted that the company's same-store sales continued to be fueled by increased transactions, higher unit volumes and favorable general merchandise trends.

Tarlowe highlighted that improvement in Walmart's margins helped deliver better-than-expected earnings in the quarter. Specifically, WMT's Q3 gross margin improved by about 20 basis points due to several reasons like increased e-commerce profitability, inventory management and a favorable business mix. Further, the operating margin expanded by 10 basis points, thanks to drivers like increased gross margin and higher membership income.

The analyst also noted the improvement in general merchandise sales in Walmart U.S., supported by factors such as enhanced assortment and share gains across all income cohorts.

Overall, Tarlowe is bullish on the stock and remains ""incrementally encouraged by WMT's ability to offer customers improved value, witness robust growth, and gain share ahead.""

Tarlowe ranks No. 331 among more than 9,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 67% of the time, delivering an average return of 17.6%.

"'Stack the deck in your favor' when you ask for more money at work, says ex-Google recruiter: Here's how","Most employers say they're willing to negotiate, and 85% of employees who try for a higher salary, better benefits, or other changes get at least some of what they asked for. Yet only 45% of U.S. workers start that conversation when they receive an offer.

That statistic that tracks with my own experience. I've hired about 2,000 people at companies including Google, DoorDash, and Carta. I'd estimate that about half of the candidates I've extended an offer to didn't negotiate at all.

So why don't more people give it a shot?

Some candidates worry the company might rescind its offer, which almost never happens. More likely, people are scared because they don't have much negotiating experience and feel unprepared.

The truth is it's hard to prepare for salary negotiations. Yes, you can — and should — review advice from reputable sources online. But we all know reading an article and negotiating with a hiring manager in the moment are very different.

As a former recruiter and the cofounder and CEO of pay transparency platform FairComp, I recommend using AI to stack the deck in your favor. Then you can walk into that negotiation ready to win.

Here's how — and exactly which prompts I use.

1. Research compensation data

You first need to understand your market value, and ChatGPT is the best research tool I've used. Here's the prompt I started with:

ChatGPT cited Glassdoor's data and gave me a link to explore more on my own.

Make sure to compare the data you collect with friends and colleagues who are in similar positions.

2. Practice negotiating with ChatGPT's voice feature

Most people leave money on the table because they're scared to ask or don't know how. Candidates often say they don't feel confident negotiating, and it makes sense. The average person will have about 12 jobs during their career, according to Zippia.

Most recruiters will negotiate more in a month than the average candidate does in their lifetime.

But we can build confidence through practice, and AI is a great tool for it, especially if you don't have an experienced mock negotiation partner within reach.

I tested three of the top AI products: ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity. As of this writing, ChatGPT's voice model feels the most realistic — using it feels like you're actually talking to a hiring manager. The free version works great, though you might want to upgrade to the $20/month version, depending on your usage.

To start getting your reps in, click on ChatGPT's voice feature and give it this prompt:

I was blown away by how realistic the conversation felt. The AI told me the compensation I asked for was outside of its budget and asked me to justify my request with data. We went back and forth, just as I would've done with a hiring manager. Then it gave me feedback on what I could do better during our next round.

To be clear, the AI negotiation simulation is not perfect and never will be. It doesn't know intimate details like how well you interviewed, or how many other candidates the company is talking to.

Even with those gaps, though, I'd argue that it's the best preparation tool on the market.

I recommend practicing for 15 minutes a day for three or four days if timing allows. A cumulative hour of practice could be worth thousands of dollars in annual salary.

Keep experimenting like a prompt engineer

Prompt engineering doesn't require technical skills. It isn't about coding — it's about persistence. Prompt engineers tinker with different inputs to get the AI to give them better answers. The more you tinker, the better responses you'll get.

Below are additional prompts I used in anticipation of negotiating an offer. Remember to adjust and tailor to suit your own needs.",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/24/ai-prompts-i-use-to-prep-for-salary-negotiations-ex-google-recruiter.html,2024-11-24 12:30:01+00:00
Can Starbucks fix long lines at its airport cafes?,"Air travelers face a host of headaches on their journeys: slow security lines, long waits for plush lounges, the threat of delays or cancellations — and the airport Starbucks.

Many travelers, flight crews and even airport employees have at some point encountered long wait times for their Starbucks cappuccinos, cold brews and egg bites.

""They need to have a better system,"" said Coresa Barrino, a Starbucks patron at New York's LaGuardia Airport Terminal B earlier this month who said she had been waiting 10 minutes and counting for her coffee. The nursing assistant, who was taking a flight back to Charlotte, North Carolina, said the wait when she buys her coffee at a Starbucks in Charlotte is about two minutes.

The long waits have caught the attention of the coffee chain's new CEO, Brian Niccol, who joined Starbucks from Chipotle in September, pledging to win back customers and reverse the company's sales slump.

Niccol told investors he thinks that licensed locations, such as those inside Target stores or airports, are interested in following the company's strategy of ""getting back to Starbucks.""

""When I think about the airports and such, there's such a huge opportunity for us to simplify some of the execution there so that we get people the great throughput that they want so they can get on their way,"" Niccol said on the company's quarterly conference call Oct. 30.

Starbucks' airport location staff — and company technology — will be put to the test this week during some of the busiest travel days of the year. The Transportation Security Administration forecast a record number of travelers during Thanksgiving week and said Sunday, Dec. 1, could be the busiest day of the year, with more than 3 million people screened at U.S. airports.

The surge in air travel, especially during peak times such as Thanksgiving, has led to congestion in airport security lines, in lounges and at gates — problems that airlines and the federal government are trying to fix. For the aviation industry, bottlenecks at airport Starbucks are just another sign of soaring demand and overcrowded airports.

A record 1.05 billion people boarded airplanes going either to, from or between U.S. airports in 2023, narrowly topping the total in 2019, before the pandemic, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.

Struggles and fresh approaches

Starbucks has recently struggled. Its sales fell for the third straight quarter in the period ended Sept. 30, as consumers pushed back against higher prices and ignored initiatives such as discounts and energy drinks aimed at bringing customers back. Same-store sales in the U.S. declined by 6% from a year earlier.

In late October, Niccol unveiled plans aimed at improving customers' experiences and reviving the company's sales, from bringing back condiment bars, to eliminating surcharges for dairy alternatives and cutting down the menu.

Cutting wait time is a key goal: He wants to trim service times down to four minutes, which would shrink long lines and improve the customer experience.

And while Starbucks started rolling out mobile order and pay to its airport locations in 2022, the change can sometimes add to the confusion and chaos at the cafe counter instead of resolving it. Plus, some travelers might not be regular Starbucks customers who already have the app downloaded.

Improving the coffee chain's airport outposts could boost both sales and the brand's reputation during a time when it needs it most. Even the customers Starbucks has lost might visit an airport location while they're traveling.

With travelers returning in droves after the pandemic, it gives Starbucks and other restaurant chains a chance to boost sales.

Concessions contribute about 4% of U.S. airport revenue annually, according to the latest available Federal Aviation Administration data, but they're an important feature to many passengers, who have limited time — and, often, energy — to fuel up before a flight.

At Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, revenue from food and beverage outlets is growing faster than passenger numbers, said Jennifer Simkins, the airport's assistant vice president of concessions. The airport has become the world's third-busiest for passengers, up from 10th place in 2019, according to Airports Council International.

Airlines are also packing more seats on their aircraft and in some cases are flying larger jets.

More passengers per plane means restaurants can become crowded during peak times with more customers waiting to be served and space limited, said Ursula Cassinerio, an assistant vice president at Moody's Ratings who covers airports.

She noted that many airports have been undergoing major renovations, if not building new terminals. That means ""more opportunities for revenue if you have more square footage for retail and restaurants,"" she said.

The 25 busiest airports in the U.S. have an average of 80 food and beverage brands as options for travelers, according to data from market research firm Technomic.

Licensing model

A challenge for Starbucks is that licensees — not Starbucks itself – operate its airport locations.

Starbucks opened its first airport location with licensee HMSHost in 1991 at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, which serves Starbucks' hometown.

For nearly three decades, HMSHost operated the chain's airport locations through an exclusive deal with Starbucks and gradually grew its airport footprint to roughly 400 outposts.

But in 2020, HMSHost ended the deal, giving the operator flexibility to offer more coffee options to airports.

While HMSHost still operates the overwhelming majority of Starbucks' airport cafes, more operators, such as Paradies Lagardere and OTG, have since taken a swing at it.

HMSHost, Paradies Lagardere and OTG did not respond to requests for comment for this story.

""Airport locations are tricky because they can make good money, but operationally, at times, they can be very challenging,"" said Mark Kalinowski, restaurant analyst and CEO of Kalinowski Equity Research.

Licensing its stores saves Starbucks the hassles of operating inside an airport, such as staffing problems, high rents and security checkpoints. And though the coffee chain is used to handling a surge of undercaffeinated customers in the mornings, the swell in demand at an airport can be even more erratic.

""A plane lands, and all of a sudden there's a hundred people when there were zero people there before,"" said Kevin Schimpf, director of industry research for Technomic.

The trade-off is that Starbucks makes less money from those licensed restaurants.

The company has more than 16,300 locations in the U.S. as of Sept. 24. But it only runs about 60% of those cafes itself; licensees operate the rest. That number includes its cafes in 47 of the 50 busiest airports in the U.S., according to Starbucks. The company did not disclose its current airport store count to CNBC.

In fiscal 2024, licensed locations accounted for 12% of Starbucks' revenue, or $4.51 billion. From those stores, Starbucks collects only licensing fees, a percentage of monthly sales through royalties, and payments for supplying its coffee, tea and food to licensees, according to company filings.

For every dollar spent in a licensed store, Starbucks generates about 7 cents of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to estimates from Bank of America analyst Sara Senatore. Company-owned stores make about 23 cents per dollar spent, Senatore wrote in a research note in September.

If its business partners and third-party providers slack off, Starbucks' brand could be damaged, the company noted in the risk factors section of its latest annual filing.

""The vast majority of customers, they don't know whether that is a company-owned Starbucks or a licensed Starbucks,"" Kalinowski said. ""They just want their Starbucks. They want it made properly. They want it quickly. And they're in a situation of heightened stress because they're trying to get to their gate.""

Airports themselves have been adopting more technology in their restaurants to help move lines along.

Labor challenges have led to more kiosks and tablets inside airport restaurants, for example.

""It's harder and harder to staff a lot of these restaurants, so any front-of-house savings that you can make by having consumers order on kiosks or tablets or whatever, that really, really helps,"" Schimpf said.

Laurie Noyes, vice president of concessions and commercial parking at Tampa International Airport, said that ""sometimes the airports are a little bit behind the street."" But she said the airport has made strides in offering more digital options and now, travelers can order food ahead of time via Uber Eats, and pick it up at airport restaurants.

Dallas Fort Worth offers DFWOrderNow, a website and platform available at digital kiosks so travelers can order food ahead. Simkins said the airport's platform will reroute Starbucks customers to Starbucks' own platform. Starbucks offers more than 170,000 possible drink orders, according to the chain's website. ""We just found the value in keeping the familiarity for their customers,"" Simkins said.

Simkins said the airport is developing robotic technology for delivery to speed up service. It's also experimenting with offering meal and retail bundles from airport restaurants and shops, she said, so passengers ""no longer have to plan their route for multiple stops"" in an airport.

A local coffee company, Fort Worth, Texas-based Ampersand, plans to open a robotic barista at DFW's Terminal C, Simkins said. It will be available 24/7, to accommodate flight crews arriving at off-hours.

Simkins said popular chains still draw a crowd.

""There are some brands that people will line up for,"" she said.

For Barrino, who was waiting for her coffee at LaGuardia, Starbucks is one of those companies.

""I just really love the brand,"" she said.",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/24/starbucks-sbux-long-lines-airport-cafes.html,2024-11-24 12:00:01+00:00
Bitcoin vs. gold: State Street worries the crypto rally's allure is distracting precious metal investors,"The bitcoin rally is generating a false sense of security among investors, according to the strategist behind the so-called granddaddy of gold exchange-traded funds.

State Street Global Advisors' George Milling-Stanley warns cryptocurrency plays don't offer the stability of gold.

""Bitcoin, pure and simple, it's a return play, and I think that people have been jumping onto the return plays,"" the firm's chief gold strategist said on CNBC's ""ETF Edge"" this week.

Milling-Stanley's comments came as his firm's SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD) celebrated its 20-year anniversary this week. It is the world's largest physically backed gold ETF, and it's up more than 30% in 2024.

""Gold was $450 an ounce [20 years ago],"" said Milling-Stanley. ""It's now five times what that price was then. If you look at a five-times price, then gold should be somewhere over $100,000 in twenty years' time.""

Gold just had its best weekly performance since March 2023. Gold futures settled at $2,712.20 on Friday, the highest settle since Nov. 5. Gold prices are now just 3% below the record high hit on Oct. 30.

Bitcoin, which has surged since the Nov. 5 election, is having a banner year, too. It hit an all-time high on Friday.

Milling-Stanley thinks investors who treasure gold's safety qualities should reconsider piling into bitcoin. He suggests the crypto world is trying to manipulate them.

""This is why they [bitcoin promoters] called it mining. There's no mining involved. This is a computer operation, pure and simple,"" he said. ""But they called it mining because they wanted to seem like gold — maybe take some of the aura away from the gold.""

Yet, he acknowledges it is unclear how high the yellow metal can actually go.

""I have no idea what's going to happen over the next 20 years except it's going to be a fun ride,"" Milling-Stanley said. ""I think that gold is going to do well.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/23/bitcoin-vs-gold-state-street-worries-about-crypto-rally.html,2024-11-23 16:00:01+00:00
"The most you should pay for housing if you earn $80,000 a year","For many Americans, housing costs aren't just another expense — they shape how the rest of the budget comes together.

Yet figuring out how much you can reasonably afford to spend on housing has become increasingly complicated in recent years, as shelter costs continue to rise.

If you earn $80,000 a year — the median household income — a decades-old rule of thumb suggests spending no more than 30% of your income on housing, or about $2,000 per month. But for many earners, that's far from realistic, especially in large cities where housing prices have surged the most.

Since August 2020, home prices have surged by 45% across the U.S., according to the most recent CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price data. Meanwhile, the cost of renting a two-bedroom apartment has climbed 22% during the same period, per Redfin.

As a result, nearly a third of American households are now considered ""cost burdened,"" meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on housing, according to the most recent U.S. Census data.

How much people earning $80,000 can afford to spend on housing

When it comes to how much of your income to put toward housing, ""something in the range of 35% to 39%"" might be a more realistic standard, says Emmanuel Eliason, a certified financial planner in Colorado. Even so, the ultimate goal should be to work toward the 30% rule of thumb over time, he adds.

Spending 50% or more of your income on housing should be avoided, if possible, says Eliason. Dedicating that much to housing puts ""undue pressure"" on your budget, limiting your ability to save for future goals or cover unexpected expenses.

It's also worth remembering that housing costs are largely fixed; it's not easy to shop around for a better deal and they rarely decrease over time. That's why it's important to leave room in your budget for flexibility.

Here's a look at the maximum amount you can put toward monthly housing costs without crossing various thresholds if you earn $80,000 a year:",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/23/how-much-you-should-pay-for-housing-if-you-earn-median-household-income.html,2024-11-23 15:00:01+00:00
"At 17, he bought a sandwich shop for $125,000—he renamed it Jersey Mike's and just sold it for $8 billion","When Peter Cancro bought Mike's Subs as a 17-year-old with a $125,000 loan from his football coach, he wasn't even old enough to legally slice cold cuts at the Point Pleasant, New Jersey, sandwich joint.

The shop, which he ended up renaming Jersey Mike's Subs, has since made him a billionaire.

On Tuesday, private equity giant Blackstone announced that it had entered into an agreement to buy a majority of Cancro's company. The deal reportedly valued Jersey Mike's Subs at around $8 billion including debt, bumping Cancro's net worth to estimated $7.5 billion, according to Bloomberg.

In 1975, however, he was just a senior in high school who didn't want to go into business. He had plans to study law and political science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The night his mom suggested he buy the business he'd been working at since he was 14, he laughed, Cancro told Forbes in August.

When he thought about it more, though, ""the light switch went off,"" he said. He called the restaurant owner the next day and the owner told Cancro he had a week to find $125,000, Cancro told ""The Jedburgh Podcast"" in 2021.

""It was something I really wanted to do,"" Cancro, now 67, told Forbes. ""At that age, you don't think you can fail.""

By the end of the week, he had secured the loan, worth nearly $750,000 in today's dollars, from a former football coach who happened to be a banker. Cancro became the sole owner of Mike's Subs before even graduating from high school.

Nearly 50 years later, the chain has just under 3,000 locations worldwide. In 2023, the company brought in $3.3 billion in sales and has had an average annual sales growth of about 20% since 2019, according to food service consulting firm Technomic.

'I'll put everything on the table'

The company's growth hasn't come without challenges. In 1991, four years after the company began franchising, the company struggled to secure the cash to pay its bills due to a series of bank failures in the Northeast, Cancro told ""The Jedburgh Podcast."" He had to fire all of his corporate staff, including his brother.

""It was a tough time: 1991 [was] my toughest recession, even beyond 2008,"" Cancro said, adding that he thought about taking the company public or selling some of his stake but didn't. In 1994, he said, the situation improved, and the chain expanded into North Carolina soon after.

In 2006, the company flatlined again, largely due to the dot-com bubble burst in 2002, he said. At the same time, his stores were starting to show their age, so he made a risky decision to give the stores a face lift. ""I said, 'I'll put everything on the table,' and we paid for the retrofits,"" he said on the podcast. ""It was only like $15 million total, but it was all the money in the world back then.""

By 2007, he said, the company was back on an upwards trajectory.

'We are still in the early innings of Jersey Mike's growth'

These days, only 1% of people who apply to own a Jersey Mike's franchise are approved, the company told Forbes. Opening a store front will run you anywhere from $200,000 to up to $1.3 million. That said, the returns can be well worth the investment: traditional locations bring in an average of $1.2 million a year in sales, according to the company's website.

Cancro will retain a minority but ""significant"" equity stake in Jersey Mike's and continue to lead the company as CEO following the completion of the acquisition, which is expected early next year, according to the press release. Blackstone's portfolio of franchisors includes Hilton Hotels and Tropical Smoothie Café.

""We believe we are still in the early innings of Jersey Mike's growth story,"" Cancro said in the release.",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/23/jersey-mikes-subs-success-story-how-peter-cancro-became-a-billionaire.html,2024-11-23 14:30:01+00:00
