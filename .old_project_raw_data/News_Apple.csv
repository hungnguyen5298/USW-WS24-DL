Don’t get caught in the 'Apple ID suspended' phishing scam,"Scammers keep coming up with new and, honestly, pretty clever ways to trick people. They socially engineer their phishing emails and messages so well that even the most tech-savvy users have to think twice. One example is the ""Apple ID Suspended"" phishing scam.

You might have seen it before since it’s been going around for the past few years.

Here’s how it works: You get an email from what looks like Apple, saying your Apple ID has been suspended.

The sender's name shows ""Apple,"" but the email is actually from a scammer trying to get you to click on a malicious link.

The Apple ID phishing emails have come a long way in recent years. They used to be plain text, had no Apple branding and didn’t even greet or address the user. Now, though, they look almost identical to genuine Apple emails. These fraudulent emails claim your Apple ID has been suspended to trick you into giving up login credentials or other sensitive information. They come complete with an Apple logo, show ""Apple ID"" as the sender name and have a big blue button that says ""Go to Apple ID.""

The email pretends to be from Apple Support, claiming your access has been suspended due to ""unusual activity"" or missing or invalid information. It says you can't access your account or Apple services until you verify your identity. There’s usually a link that leads to a fake Apple site, asking you to enter your username, password and additional personal details to reactivate your account. To add urgency, it even warns that if you don’t verify your Apple ID within 24 hours, it will be permanently blocked.

If you’re not paying attention, it’s easy to get tricked into clicking the link in a scam like this. But if you’re keeping an eye out, there are plenty of red flags. I’ve added a sample phishing email below, and you’ll spot the issues immediately. For one, it’s not actually from Apple; the email domain is @uaepass.ae, which has nothing to do with Apple. Any legit Apple email will end with ""@email.apple.com,"" so anything else is an instant red flag.

Then there’s the awful grammar and punctuation. A company worth $3.37 trillion can definitely afford a decent content writer. You know someone at Apple is not going to mix up past and present tense like it’s their first time writing an email.

Take this gem: ""Therefore we need to re-verify your account data. if you did not verify your account within 48 hour, your account will be permanently locked, go to Apple ID and verify as soon as possible."" It reads like someone smashed a bunch of words together and called it a day. I'm not trying to give a grammar lesson here, but you get the point.

1. Check the email address: Always verify the sender’s email address. Any legitimate email from Apple will come from a domain ending in ""@email.apple.com."" If it’s anything else, like @uaepass.ae, it’s a scam.

2. Look for spelling and grammar mistakes: Phishing emails often have poor grammar and punctuation. If the message sounds odd or looks like it was written by someone who doesn’t know how to write well, be suspicious.

3. Don’t click on suspicious links: If the email asks you to click a link, don’t do it right away. Hover over the link to see the actual URL. If it doesn’t look like an official Apple website (or any site you trust), don’t click it.

The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.

4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): This adds an extra layer of protection to your Apple ID. Even if a scammer gets your password, they won’t be able to log in without the second authentication step.

5. Verify directly with Apple: If you’re ever unsure about an email or message, go directly to Apple’s official website or contact their support team. Don’t use any contact info provided in a suspicious email.

6. Invest in data removal services: Scammers often use personal information that’s readily available online to craft more convincing phishing attempts. By investing in data removal services, you can reduce the amount of personal data that’s exposed on the web, making it harder for scammers to target you effectively.

While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.

Scammers are getting pretty clever, but you don’t have to fall for their tricks. By staying alert and keeping an eye out for those red flags, you can easily spot these phishing attempts before they catch you off guard. Always double-check the sender’s email address, watch for bad grammar and don’t click on any suspicious links. If something feels off, don’t hesitate to go directly to Apple’s official website or contact their support team.

I got an in-store Apple Intelligence demo. Here are some useful features I hadn't spotted.,"I visited an Apple store to get a rundown of all that Apple Intelligence is offering.

Math Notes, available on iOS 18, solves complex equations using AI in the Calculator app.

Safari's 'hide' tool removes distractions from webpages, enhancing online shopping experiences.

I've been covering Apple's AI rollout since it was first announced at the Worldwide Developers Conference in June, and I'm still learning about all it has to offer.

I visited an Apple store on Thursday morning for an Apple Intelligence tutorial. It was mostly a recap of the features I've tried already, but two tools were surprisingly useful.

The demo was quick, less than 15 minutes, and I was helped by two store employees who said they usually show shoppers features based on which apps they frequently use. For me, that meant a recap of the ""clean up"" tool in the Photos app, but I got new details on Math Notes and a ""hide"" feature on Safari.

Apple launched its AI software in beta with the iOS 18.1 update in October — the first of a rollout happening over the next several months. Although flashier features, like the Image Playground and Genmojis, aren't included yet, many new AI-powered tools exist on iPhone 15 Pro models or later.

When I played with Apple Intelligence on my own, I was impressed, but I couldn't fully explore it since my iPhone 14 Pro Max isn't compatible with the software. If you've recently upgraded to an iPhone 15 Pro or later, an AI walkthrough might be beneficial.

Here's what you might've missed if you haven't gotten a tutorial.

I thought Math Notes would come out later

I was impressed by Math Notes when Apple first demonstrated it at WWDC, but it was unclear which phase of Apple Intelligence it would be included in.

The AI-powered math helper was rolled out with iOS 18 in September, before the official Apple Intelligence launch. Unlike other AI tools, Math Notes is available on any iPhone compatible with iOS 18.

In the Calculator app, you can type complex math equations, and your phone will use AI to solve them. On iPads, you can use a pencil to write out the problems. I can't help but wonder where this was when I was in high school.

I could see myself using ""hide"" on Safari a lot

Although I've read about and reported on Apple Intelligence's uses in the Safari app, I didn't have the chance to see how they could be applied to my daily life.

One store employee demonstrated how the ""hide"" tool removes distracting elements from a webpage. He used the shopping site Temu as an example. When he clicked the hide button and selected which parts he didn't want to see — mostly ads — the page transformed to become an efficient showing of items to shop from.

This tool would definitely come in handy for an online shopper like myself who wants to get straight to the goods.

There's also the Tips app

If you can't make it to an Apple store for a rundown, there's always the Tips app with a section on Apple Intelligence. It provides some guidance on how to use the AI available on iOS 18.1 so far.

I went through it while first exploring Apple Intelligence, but the hands-on demo in a store gave me some more details.

Apple has said that there's more to come in December with the release of iOS 18.2, and there's more Apple Intelligence on the horizon in 2025.

Apple will never stop thinking about making a TV,"It’s not exactly a secret that Apple has explored the possibility of building a television. Before his death in 2011, co-founder Steve Jobs famously told biographer Walter Isaacson that he’d “finally cracked it,” but no full-fledged Apple TV (as opposed to the Apple TV set-top box) has emerged in the years since.

Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reports that Apple went as far as building full-scale prototypes with a large display that could also serve as a touchscreen Mac or iPad. But Apple eventually halted the project after examining the TV market and deciding not to compete in a low-margin business where consumers rarely buy new products. Also an issue: high costs.

The company reportedly considered the TV idea again in 2019, as it was considering paths forward for Apple TV, but it decided instead to bring its app and streaming subscription to televisions made by other companies.

Now, with the company developing a number of smart home devices (including a wall-mounted tablet), Gurman reports that a full-fledged Apple TV is once again on the table — though executives could be dissuaded once again by those same market and cost factors.",TechCrunch,https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/24/apple-will-never-stop-thinking-about-making-a-tv/,2024-11-24 20:54:34+00:00
‘Wolfs’ sequel canceled because director ‘no longer trusted’ Apple,"It may be hard to remember, but George Clooney and Brad Pitt co-starred in a movie, “Wolfs,” that Apple released just two months ago.

On Friday, the film’s writer and director Jon Watts said Friday that a sequel is no longer happening; in a follow-up interview with Deadline, he explained that he “no longer trusted [Apple] as a creative partner.”

The company is reportedly scaling back its movie strategy. “Wolfs,” for example, was supposed to get a big theatrical release, but instead, it played in a limited number of theaters for just one week before launching on Apple TV+.

Watts, who also created the new Star Wars show “Skeleton Crew,” said Apple’s shift “was a total surprise and made without any explanation or discussion.”

“I was completely shocked and asked them to please not include the news that I was writing a sequel,” Watts said. “They ignored my request and announced it in their press release anyway, seemingly to create a positive spin to their streaming pivot.”

As a result, Watts said he “quietly returned the money they gave me for the sequel” and canceled the project.",TechCrunch,https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/23/wolfs-sequel-canceled-because-director-no-longer-trusted-apple/,2024-11-23 22:26:31+00:00
The Rebellion of a Fruitless Apple Tree,"As the rest of our culture thrives on overexposure, why shouldn’t a garden have the right to retain an air of mystery?

Every autumn, I begin to crave generic seasonal comforts: the hues of turning leaves, the chill of sweater weather. I’m not really a pumpkin-spice person, but I’m a sucker for a classic u-pick apple orchard. In California, where I live, the weather in autumn is often more like summer, and seasonal discomforts include heat waves and wildfires. But apples remain one of the harbingers of the changing seasons.

I live in what is called wine country, but it used to be known as apple country. From the time it was colonized in the early nineteenth century and through the mid-twentieth century, Sonoma County’s agricultural industry centered on growing and processing apples, especially in the western reaches near the Russian River, where the early-season variety Gravenstein tends to thrive. Most of the fields here are now populated by high-end grape vines, but a few small apple growers persist, thanks in part to a recent resurgence in the popularity of hard cider. Recently I drove to the river with my partner and some friends, for a late-summer swim. The region was experiencing another heat dome. The two-lane highway lay alongside a few miles of old orchards, the trees’ lateral branches leaning on propped-up sticks, heavy with fruit. In the car, I passed around a plastic bag full of sliced apples. In the back seat, my friends crunched their slices and one of them asked, casually, “Are these from your garden?”

It was not an unreasonable question—I have a garden, it contains six apple trees, and apple season was approaching. But it filled me with shame. I demurred. “No, not yet,” I said. Not ever, I said to myself. My apple trees, to my great shame, have never flowered, which means they have never made fruit. And it’s probably my fault.

Lately, reminders of my horticultural failures are ever present. All summer long my social-media feeds were flush with triumphant garden photos: boastful shots of a hand holding five cherry tomatoes or a few green beans, and a caption proclaiming something like “today’s harvest!” or “our first crop of the year!” This strikes me as a bit precious; I’m generally not a proponent of pretending one’s hobby is a means of survival, or anything but what it is: leisure, with snacks. Still, I engage in plenty of my own online garden braggadocio, posting daily closeups of the roses and other perennial flowers I grow in my back yard. I keep the unproductive apple trees off my grid. I wouldn’t want to sully the mood.

The big secret of Western gardening is that it’s easy to grow things here. My garden is on a fearsome north-facing hill, surrounded by tall trees (the tallest—redwoods), but the back yard gets sun. It’s a cottage-style garden, which is to say that it’s motley and crowded. There are a few dozen rose bushes, various other perennial flowers, and a brace of fruit trees: the six apples, two plums (Santa Rosa and European prune), a persimmon (Hachiya), and a multi-graft Asian pear whose branches the local raccoons keep breaking in their nightly revelry. Living in the woods as I do, the border between the cultivated areas and the rest of the forest understory is porous. My garden is home to many birds, bugs, rodents, and other forest critters. In the giant redwood and oak trees that surround it, a family of acorn woodpeckers make their nests. Their red plumage looks like little fascinator hats, and their calls sound like a cackle. When I do my dawn patrol of the beds each morning, I imagine they’re laughing at me and my barren apple trees. I’ve made this garden a major part of my life, my personality, and my career. I even cast the apple trees as major characters in my memoir. And yet the fruits do not fall.

My dad, who is an actual fruit-tree expert, has a favorite gardening aphorism: “The best time to plant a fruit tree is twenty years ago.” I was late, but willing to wait. In 2017, the year my partner and I moved into our house, we planted bare-root trees, a handful of heirloom varietals that my father recommended for growing good cider apples. Bare-root fruit trees are paltry twiglike things, but with agreeable circumstances they should begin to fruit in about two to five years. By year five—springtime, 2022—I had high hopes that delicate blossoms would appear on the trees’ branches. Bud count: zero. The sixth year, 2023, I declared that I was patient, that the trees could take their time, no worries. But by year seven, I expected bounty. This was the year—it had to be the year. The apple trees leafed out green, then greener. Then they stayed disappointingly leafy; no flush of pink and white blossom followed the first tentative shoots. The trees did not flower, which meant they would not bear fruit.

When I finally admitted to my dad that my trees didn’t have any apples, he said what he usually does when I unload my garden anxiety on him: “Eh, I’m not worried.” It was a bad year for apples all over this region, he said, continuing to peruse the sports pages.

“No,” I emphasized. “Not just this year. They have never had fruit. They don’t flower! At all!”

He put down the paper. “O.K.,” he said, “Now I’m a little worried.”

Fruit production is an indicator of how a tree distributes its resources. If the trees aren’t anomalous late bloomers and are otherwise healthy, my dad posited, something must be causing them to invest all their hard-won nutrients into branches and leaves instead of flowers and fruit. It could be a lack of sun, or excessive cold in springtime, or not enough cold during the winter, he speculated. But, I replied, hoping the envy didn’t show in my tone, tons of my neighbors have fruitful apple trees, which means it’s not about the weather—right? He gave the perennial advice that no nervous gardener wants to hear: wait and see what happens next year.

Impatient, I consulted my other favorite gardening resource, the Web sites of a great many university-extension agriculture programs, the research and public-education arms of American land-grant universities. (The ways in which the government appropriated the land for these universities, beginning in the late eighteen-hundreds, are far from admirable, but the gardening advice holds up.) According to the University of Massachusetts and the University of Pennsylvania, overfertilization is the most common cause of unfruitfulness—an unlikely explanation in my case, since I have a light hand with fertilizers. Another possible culprit was pruning, the chore that in many ways defined my relationship to the garden.

Winter pruning is a deceptively simple concept: while an apple tree is dormant, a gardener prunes her trees by cutting off, or heading, some of a branch’s recent growth. If all goes well, this injury, paradoxically, will stimulate it to grow further. But cut too much, and it’s possible the tree might send too many of its resources into survival mode, forgoing flowers. The horticulturalist Liberty Hyde Bailey devotes a significant portion of his 1916 book, “The Pruning Manual,” to discussing the grievous woes that might arise from applying blade to tree.

I used to be afraid of pruning. That changed when, soon after we planted the apple trees, I developed chronic pain, the result of a medical accident that upended my life for several years. My garden became a site of recuperation, and in my own wounded state I became captivated by the idea that injury can, ultimately, encourage an organism to thrive. I was not alone in projecting big feelings onto my garden. Bailey believed that pruning, specifically, can “bring the person into closest contact and sympathy with the plant.” I found that the task embodied the perpetual frisson between care, influence, and control that so often defines our relationships with nature—the ways in which gardening can be, as Jamaica Kincaid says, “a conversation.” After I figured that out, I pruned with enthusiasm. Perhaps too much of it.

If gardening is about relationships between people and nature, it can sometimes mirror a classic of the genre: resource extraction, or at least resource manipulation. It can be too easy to slip into a quid-pro-quo attitude about gardening: I do something, I get something. I invest in the plants the minimal resources they need to grow; they provide me with beauty, diversion, and infinite opportunities to overthink it. (Also, snacks.) But my evolving relationship with the apple trees makes it clear to me that there’s a different way. Must even our pleasure gardens be subject to the human fetish for more? The natural world shouldn’t need to be productive in order to earn our care.

This season, I’ve been trying to spend less time tormenting myself with Instagram envy-bait and more time enjoying the garden itself. One recent evening, I walked through the beds, rogue blackberry shoots scratching my bare ankles, and I tried to cultivate an appreciation for the apple trees in their green, barren state. There is a beguiling rebelliousness to an unproductive fruit tree. They’re beautiful, with trunks about the diameter of my biceps, and they shimmy defiantly in the devilish autumn wind. Although they’re supposed to be dwarf varietals, they are twice as tall as me, a reminder that, despite all our human failures, plants are predisposed to growing—they just don’t always grow the way we want them to. These trees are not beholden to me, or to utility. They use their resources however they want.

Perhaps this is what a garden is for: to remind me that, sometimes, I suck at it. With the exception of a few chaotic minutes each week spent on Duolingo or trying out that new Pilates class, adults spend most of our time doing things we’re already good at. Every hour spent in the garden, on the other hand, is awash in the unknowable. If my garden could talk, it would look at my social-media feeds and laugh; it would then remove from my online shopping cart all the overpriced autumnal harvest accessories—the gingham-patterned clogs and reclaimed-wood harvest baskets—and say, gently, firmly: not today, Etsy. My dad’s mentor, the mercurial English horticulturalist and Shakespearean actor Alan Chadwick, believed that “the whole miracle of the garden is made up of secrets.” Why shouldn’t a garden have the right to retain an air of mystery, when the rest of our culture thrives on overexposure?

Soon the apple trees will go quiet, drop their leaves, and enter a state of deep rest. This winter, I’ll try to prune more gently, and I’ll probably fail. Perhaps the trees will begin to move incrementally back toward pre-human growth patterns. Maybe, decades from now, the next human occupant of this land will give up on them entirely and “prune them with a spade,” as my dad likes to say. Until then, I’ll stand expectantly under the Belle de Boskoop, which by this time of year should be dropping dozens of big, russeted apples on the ground. It has vigorous, almost uncontrollable branches, and we’ve pruned it hard every year in an attempt at sculpting its form. But it reaches ever upward, each lateral proudly unburdened by fruit. If it never crops, it’ll still be here: the Bartleby of my garden, quietly, stubbornly, declining participation in the grind. If it does eventually bear apples, I’ll prep the hand-crank cider mill, preferably while wearing those gingham accessories. The woodpeckers will have new reasons to laugh at me. ♦",The New Yorker,https://www.newyorker.com/culture/onward-and-upward-in-the-garden/the-rebellion-of-a-fruitless-apple-tree,2024-10-28 06:00:00-04:00
"Apple Matches Worker Donations to IDF and Illegal Settlements, Employees Allege","An open letter from Apple employees and shareholders demands the tech giant stop matching employee donations to organizations with ties to the Israeli military assault on the Gaza Strip and ongoing illegal settlement development in the West Bank. The letter, building on a previous demand by Apple employees for a ceasefire in the conflict, calls on the company to “promptly investigate and cease matching donations to all organizations that further illegal settlements in occupied territories and support the IDF.”

As with many large corporations, Apple employees can make donations to a number of nonprofit organizations and receive matching contributions from their employer through a platform called Benevity. Among the charitable organizations eligible for dollar-matching from Apple are Friends of the IDF, an organization that collects donations on behalf of soldiers in the Israeli military, as well as a number of groups that contribute to the settlement enterprise in the West Bank, including HaYovel, One Israel Fund, the Jewish National Fund, and IsraelGives.

Apple did not respond to a request for comment.

“Unfortunately, there has been very little scrutiny into 501(c)(3) organizations that openly support illegal activities in the West Bank and Gaza,” said Diala Shamas, a senior staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, who described the organizations listed in the campaign as among “the worst actors.”

A legislative effort in New York called the “Not On Our Dime Act” is seeking to challenge the ability of nonprofit organizations in the state to fundraise for illegal settlements, including by making them subject to legal liability or loss of their nonprofit status. Laws against funding activities that violate international human rights law are poorly enforced by the IRS, said Shamas, leaving it to companies and individuals themselves to ensure that their contributions are not going toward organizations potentially engaged in illegal activity.

“Companies often rely on the fact that an organization has 501(c)(3) status. But regardless of whether an organization has nonprofit status, it is illegal to aid and abet war crimes,” Shamas said. “Apple should ensure that it is not sending funds to any of these organizations — especially now when there’s no shortage of evidence or information about the unlawful activities of the settlement movement in the West Bank.”

Apple employees, who organized under the name Apples4Ceasefire, had previously objected to the disciplining and firing of Apple Store employees who “dared to express support of the Palestinian people in the form of kaffiyehs, pins, bracelets, or clothing,” according to a public statement published in April.

The letter — signed by 133 people who describe themselves as “a group of shareholders and current and former employees” — comes on the heels of broader activism at tech companies by some workers objecting to perceived complicity between their employers and the ongoing war in Gaza. Earlier this year, Google fired dozens of employees who took part in a protest over the company’s involvement in a cloud-computing project known as Project Nimbus, which provided services to the Israeli government and military. An open letter from employees of Meta — which owns Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp — has criticized its treatment of Palestinian solidarity within the company.

The provision of donations to NGOs helping facilitate the illegal occupation of the West Bank has come under increasing scrutiny as the situation in the region has deteriorated since the October 7 attacks by Hamas and subsequent Israeli military onslaught. Tens of thousands of Palestinians, mostly civilians, are believed to have been killed by the Israel Defense Forces in a campaign that has resulted in war crimes charges brought by the International Criminal Court and genocide charges at the International Court of Justice.

The conduct and discipline of the IDF has come under particular scrutiny as soldiers have been accused of torture, extrajudicial killings, and other abuses against Palestinians, alongside social media footage posted by many IDF service members themselves of apparent looting and mistreatment of Palestinian detainees. Friends of the IDF, one of the charities on Apple’s matching donations list, is registered as a nonprofit organization for the purposes of fundraising for IDF service members and claims to have transferred $34.5 million in donations to the Israeli military in the first weeks after the war began.

This conflict windfall has helped other organizations on Apple’s matching contribution list. An analysis by The Guardian last December showed that the crowdfunding platform IsraelGives received over $5.3 million in donations in just two months after the war to support military, paramilitary, and settlement activity in the West Bank. The same analysis showed that this money came disproportionately from U.S. donors, and included specific funding campaigns to support illegal settlements whose residents had a history of violent attacks against Palestinian civilians.

Other organizations on Apple’s matching contribution list appear to include support for religious extremism or back activity in the West Bank deemed illegal under international law. The One Israel Fund, for example, includes on its website a talk titled “The Arab Takeover of Judea and Samaria: Who Is Behind It; What Can Be Done?” — invoking the religious name of the territory that is deemed to be part of a future Palestinian state under international law. HaYovel, a Christian Zionist organization, states on its website that its goal is to help further the “prophetic restoration” of a region that “many incorrectly refer to as the West Bank.” The charitable status of the Jewish National Fund has come under criticism in both the U.S. and European Union due its historic involvement in the “systematic discrimination” against Palestinians since the founding of the state of Israel, as well as ongoing support for dispossession of Palestinians in the West Bank.

Like many of its competitors, Apple professes a corporate commitment to “respecting internationally recognized human rights” frameworks, including the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights, according to its website. Since the war began, the U.N. Human Rights Office has repeatedly decried atrocities committed by the IDF.",The Intercept,https://theintercept.com/2024/06/11/apple-donations-idf-israel-gaza-illegal-settlements/,2024-06-11 18:47:49+00:00
"Mexicans celebrate Day of Dead, grapple with keeping tradition ","Every year this time Mexico erupts in celebrations during the Day of the Dead. Families gather at cemeteries across the country on November 1 to reconnect with their dead just as their ancestors have done for centuries.

For many more in small communities, it's also about preserving the core of their traditions as celebrations in places in bigger hubs have increasingly been marked by mass tourism.

""We're conserving our tradition, part of our heritage that my mother instilled in me,"" said 58-year-old Antonio Melendez. ""We can't let it be lost.""

Observance dates back centuries

Melendez was among throngs of people gathered in the cemetery, tucked away in the maze of canals and brick buildings in Xochimilco, a borough in south of Mexico City that has long carried on traditions that have faded away in other parts of the country.

He gathered with his two daughters around the grave of his mother, marked by orange flower petals spread out in the shape of a cross and bouquets of pink flowers, his mother's favorite color.

Melendez said she died last year, and the loss was still fresh, so he was trying to remember her by continuing with the same rituals he watched her carry out growing up, this time with his daughters. He started preparing for the celebration four days before, making tamales from scratch and building a small altar for her in their home.

Day of the Dead dates back centuries to ancient Indigenous civilizations, which would organize parties when someone died to guide them on to the next life, and lay out food in altars to nourish them on their journeys.

When Spanish colonizers arrived and began forcing Catholicism upon Indigenous communities, they would mix Indigenous traditions with Catholic holidays. Celebrations of the dead then synced up with All Saints Day on November 1, ending on November 2.

While celebrations begin ramping up at the end of October, Mexican tradition says that on that night their deceased are closest to the living world, and people hope to keep them company. Each family celebrates in different ways.

In San Gregorio Pantheon, elderly women carry massive bundles of orange flowers, the iconic flower of death. Some families sob into each other's arms. Others sit alone next to loved one's graves in silence. Many more drink mezcal and tell stories of their family members.

'It's like being with them'

Gathered with her daughter and granddaughter, 60-year-old Beatriz Chavez kneels at the graves of her son, nephew and father, quietly lighting candles.

""It's like being with them one more year, feeling like even if they don't see them, we feel like we're closer to them,"" Chavez said, noting that she planned to sleep in the graveyard, just like she did every year since her father died when she was 10.

Over the years, the tradition has been the focus of the Disney film Coco. A Day of the Dead parade in Mexico City was also featured in a James Bond film, despite such a parade not existing in real life. Annual celebrations later adopted the idea of the parade from the movie.

Now, people from all over the world have flocked to the Latin American nation, eager to experience the rich tradition for themselves.

But once quaint celebrations in hubs for the Day of the Dead like Mexico City, Oaxaca and Michoacan have started to brim with tourists, who snap photos of mourners. In recent years, many Mexicans have also started to mix the celebration with Halloween. Other new traditions — such as the James Bond parade — have popped up.

Some, like Melendez, prickle at the shifts.

""Here, Halloween isn't ours, it's Day of the Dead,"" he said. ""It's sad because it's getting distorted. We're losing the essence of who we are. This is a part of us, our roots.""

For Melendez, it adds an extra level of importance to the celebration in their small cemetery, which he and others say has stayed true to the centuries-old traditions.

It coincides with a larger conversation playing out across Mexico amid an influx of American ""expats"" and tourists. As more move to or travel to Mexico City, rents have gotten so high that many Mexicans have been pushed out of areas they've lived in for much of their lives, leaving frustration simmering in much of the city.

Those who wander the graves and sell flowers and food in the streets see the changes less as a loss of tradition, and more as an evolution — a way for younger generations to continue passing on their heritage in their own ways, and share it with new audiences.",Voice Of America,https://www.voanews.com/a/mexicans-celebrate-day-of-dead-grapple-with-keeping-tradition-/7849024.html,2024-11-02 20:29:47+00:00
The Ornery Intrigues of “Slow Horses”,"The uncomplicated intrigues of Slow Horses.

Emblematic of post–prestige television drama, AppleTV+’s spy thriller relies on the dyspeptic repartee and verbal sparring instead of sophisticated plot twists.

The slow horses of Slow Horses used to be agents, analysts, or operatives working out of the headquarters of MI5, Britain’s domestic counterintelligence agency. But these are not retirees put out to pasture; they are the rejects, misfits, and screwups relegated to a dilapidated building called Slough House, condemned to spend the rest of their days on mind-numbing busywork. The man in charge is Jackson Lamb (zealously portrayed by Gary Oldman), the ornery, flatulent, and soused patron saint of slow horses.

Nothing is meant to happen in Slough House. The agents there do not officially run operations; their purview is supposed to be strictly desk work. But it’s because MI5 treats the place as a trash bin that things get interesting. The nasty truths that higher-ups would rather bury or burn or pretend never happened have a way of turning up, and Lamb and his band of “joes” keep finding their way to the center of national security scandals and crises.

The return of Slow Horses is good news for Apple TV+, especially since the company has recently announced plans to scale back its feature film ambitions. The show’s third season was one of the streaming service’s top performers as Apple TV+ enjoyed a record year for Emmy nominations, proof that though the viewership numbers may not be there, the money was still providing some returns. And in contrast to the numerous streaming series with inconsistent release times between seasons—cough, cough, Severance—Slow Horses has come out on a dependable schedule: Its fourth season arrives a mere nine months after we last said goodbye to Lamb and his misfits, and the fifth is already wrapped.

That might be why, anecdotally at least, Slow Horses is finding its audience. The series does not aspire to The Wire’s sophisticated critiques of society; it won’t challenge your notions of duty and marriage like The Americans did; it even avoids the pretensions to profundity of True Detective. But it is emblematic of where drama has gone in the post-peak-TV era: gilt production values, a movie star or two, perhaps a plot twist, and the uncomplicated watchability of the late-aughts cable dramas. It’s not homework, and it doesn’t feel like it is. Welcome to the era of prestige popcorn TV.

Slow Horses is based on a series of novels by Mick Herron, whose version of spycraft is about not the latest gadgets but raw, practical ingenuity—stealing a key card, having the right lie to tell, outscheming your opponent. But more important, the novels bestow their own dark humor and wry, sarcastic tone, and the show amps up the antic energy: Created by Will Smith, a veteran of Armando Iannucci’s acerbic workplace sitcoms, Slow Horses is like The Thick of It or Veep, except that your favorite characters might get shot.

Each of the show’s seasons is six episodes and spans a particular case from beginning to end. To some extent, each case can stand on its own, though the show takes advantage of our familiarity with its characters to find new ways of getting them into trouble. Usually, a body turns up or someone is kidnapped and a conspiracy starts to unravel. Lamb and Slough House are dragged into it, and the joes are sent off on their missions, alone or in pairs, so they can bicker like siblings, or call Lamb and bicker with him.

The slow horses of Slough House might appear broken and useless at first, but most of them are capable agents with a fatal flaw; they’re not incompetent, just imperfect. Some are being punished for real or perceived mistakes, like the otherwise capable Louisa. Some are just unbearable, such as Roddy, a certified computer genius who is so delusional and pathetically sexist that no one can stand to work with him. Others are compromised: Marcus gambles, Shirley has her anger issues (and a coke problem), Catherine is an alcoholic who is on the wagon and tries to run the office despite Lamb’s best efforts. Then there’s the new guy, JK Coe, who has not said a word since his arrival.

But the most prominent of the rejects is River Cartwright (Jack Lowden), our original entrée into the series and a former rising star at MI5 who can’t shake his blockbuster-level hero complex. River has all the skills to be that guy, except that every time he goes rogue to save the world, he gets himself into worse trouble. An unfortunate but conspicuous blunder put a halt to River’s budding career, but the Cartwright name still has pull at MI5 headquarters.

In the show’s first episode, River is tasked with rooting through a journalist’s trash. It’s nasty work, but it provides one of the show’s recurring insights: People can control how they present themselves, but if you want to see how someone really lives, you should look through their trash. That’s true for institutions, too.

After a couple of seasons in which he shared the stage with his colleagues, River is at the center of the latest case. His grandfather, David Cartwright (Jonathan Pryce), practically used to run MI5, where he was second-in-command. He’s an important source of counsel throughout the series, but age has caught up with the old legend, and memory loss and confusion have put at risk all the spiky secrets locked in his mind. It is tragic when David doesn’t recognize his grandson, but it’s far more dangerous when he thinks he’s briefing an agent in the middle of the Cold War.

In the face of terror bombings, right-wing extremism, rogue operations, and sleeper KGB agents, the true villainy in Slow Horses is all the things MI5 does in the name of security and of preserving itself. Though its brass would often prefer to toss its trash into Slough House (figuratively but sometimes also literally), secrets bubble to the surface. In season four, this becomes more personal than ever.

Although all of the slow horses are sentenced to Slough House against their will, Lamb relishes his state of semi-­retirement (though perhaps not his responsibilities as warden) as well as the maneuverability it gives him. Lamb answers to no one and gets involved only when he feels like it. If spycraft is about information—manipulating, uncovering, or inferring it—Lamb is the genius always one or two steps ahead. If he has a code, it is the code of spycraft: Even if he loathes them, he protects his people.

Jackson Lamb is the show’s most distinctive creation, and Gary Oldman its biggest star. In his image, the show coalesces its tone, point of view, and position in the marketplace. Lamb is a tortured male genius in a way that feels almost old-fashioned, made so distasteful that it feels novel. He is sarcastic and blunt and hostile to propriety. He acts like everyone is an idiot slowing him down, and they usually are. For a show in which characters relate to one another through the art of the insult, Lamb is at the top of the heap. He’s a Malcolm Tucker who doesn’t shower, a Logan Roy with no ambition, a Larry David without the irony.

Oldman’s Lamb is not exactly unprecedented; he’s just extreme. He’s the driving force and also the vehicle for a base, lowbrow humor, lest you start to take the show too seriously. Our first image of Lamb is of the holes in his socks; his first expression is a fart. In the third season we witness his version of a shower, which amounts to filling a cramped sink and splashing his pits with tepid water. As you might guess, Lamb’s personal hygiene and appearance belie his wit and competence.

Lamb’s capabilities are most often on display in his interactions with the leaders from MI5. The show relishes putting Oldman’s slovenly figure opposite Kristin Scott Thomas’s crisp and businesslike Diana Taverner. Taverner is “second desk,” or second-in-command, at MI5, and she’s often behind whatever shitstorm threatens to rain down on Slough House. While the other characters focus on the pieces in front of them, Lamb and Taverner play the whole board. But the show would stumble without actors of the stature seen here. Like Pryce’s David Cartwright flitting in and out of lucidity, Taverner only has whatever gravitas Scott Thomas brings to the role. That’s because for all her apparent ambition, Taverner is a character with simple aims: She merely wants to advance her career to the next spot above her current one. Like the MI5 itself, she exists only for her own preservation and advancement. Taverner is always politicking, but with no politics.

Depending on your point of view, this is either a feature or a bug of the series as a whole. Even in the first season, when a white-nationalist terrorist organization forms the immediate threat, the group’s politics are so cartoonish as to be toothless; its views exist only so that we may dismiss them. Peter Judd (played by Samuel West as a sleek version of Boris Johnson) makes the appropriate incendiary comments, but who knows what he actually believes. Belief isn’t something that enters Taverner’s mind either, or that of Sophie Okonedo’s Ingrid Tearney (the director, or “first desk,” of MI5) when she negotiates with or attempts to outmaneuver Judd. There are no true believers in Slow Horses, no one doing it for the love of duty or country, just as there is no real political view behind any character or action of consequence.

In the same way the spycraft in Slow Horses strives to be unfantastical, the show’s politics are unphilosophical; Lamb and Taverner’s arguments are strategic, not existential. Lamb is an acceleration and a step backward. He is a test of how detestable you can make a character and still be entertained by him. Lamb has crafted himself into the ultimate misfit and outcast of the system, but without a critique of the system, and of course no critique of his own role in it.

And through four seasons at least, there’s been no risk of that pesky self-awareness coming around the corner. But that suits the show just fine. Details like that would bog it down, or at least give us more to think about—and that’s not what Apple TV+ is aiming for. As with its other recent successes (see Hijack and Presumed Innocent), the streamer is serving up the aesthetics of prestige with the pulpy, twisty pleasures at which TV has always excelled.

On this measure, Slow Horses is a triumph. You can watch it with your roommates, your parents, or your grandkids. It’s funny, tonally consistent, serialized yet self-contained. Each season of the show boasts a different director, but you won’t notice unless you’re looking for that. It’s sleek, but not stylish; it’s grimy, but in a cool, clean way. And though it’s a show that relishes banter and verbal sparring, the action set-pieces are what truly draw you in: tragic chase sequences, attempted heists, infiltrations, sieges, and shootouts. Beneath its fanfare of sharp elbows and dyspeptic discontent, Slow Horses intends to go down easy. Like Jackson Lamb in Slough House, there are benefits to just being the sideshow.",The Nation,https://www.thenation.com/article/culture/slow-horses-apple-tv-spy-series/,2024-09-16 09:00:00+00:00
These Guys Hacked AirPods to Give Their Grandmas Hearing Aids,"Three technologists in India used a homemade Faraday cage and a microwave oven to get around Apple’s location blocks.

When Apple released a software update at the start of November that enabled its new hearing aid features in AirPods Pro 2 earbuds, Rithwik Jayasimha immediately went out with his dad to buy a pair for his grandma. “We came back home, we took them out of the case, and I was looking for the feature and it was just missing,” Jayasimha says. India, where Jayasimha and his family live, is not one of the many countries where Apple’s hearing aid features are available. “It was a huge bummer,” Jayasimha says.

Instead of abandoning the headphones, Jayasimha and two friends, Arnav Bansal and Rithvik Vibhu—both of whom say they have grandmas who use hearing aids as well—hacked a way to bypass Apple’s location restrictions and enable their hearing aids in Bengaluru.

To dodge Apple’s geolocation restrictions, the trio built a rudimentary, signal-blocking Faraday cage on top of a microwave with aluminum foil, which ultimately allowed them to enable the hearing aid settings. “We don’t even think it’s Apple’s fault. The feature is amazing,” Jayasimha says.

The group members, who have a mix of hardware and software skills and first detailed their hack as part of a technology collective called Lagrange Point, say a couple of dozen people have contacted them asking for help with their AirPods. “We’ve got a huge amount of interest from folks in India who have these AirPods or whose grandparents need them and they’ve not been able to use them,” Jayasimha says. Others have documented the same issue in social media posts.

The researchers demonstrated that they could bypass Apple’s geographic restrictions with a set of AirPods Pro 2 connected to a 10th generation Wi-Fi-only iPad. They note that it would be possible to do the workaround on an iPhone or iPad connected to a mobile carrier as well, but it would be more involved.

To find the workaround, the researchers first looked at the different ways that iOS establishes where a device is in the world. For Wi-Fi-only devices, there are a few checks. The server looks at which Apple Store region the device is connected to, as well as the time zone, language, and region the device is set to. Additionally, the operating system sends a simple web request to an Apple web service that then responds with the country code of the country the device appears to be in based on the location associated with its IP address.

The researchers first tried manually changing the time zone and region settings for the iPad, but it ultimately wasn’t clear whether this impacted their ability to hide the iPad’s true location. When masking the iPad’s IP address so it would appear to be connected in the United States didn’t work, the researchers assessed other metrics the device might be using to establish its geographic location. It turns out that iOS also examines Wi-Fi “service set identifiers,” or SSIDs, that help devices connect to the right Wi-Fi network when there are many network signals in the air—like in an apartment building or at a coffee shop.

The operating system also uses GPS triangulation and device identifier “MAC addresses” of nearby devices, including routers, to establish a device’s location. In other words, even if a person in Bengaluru uses a proxy to make it seem like their iPad has a US-based IP address, all the nearby routers and devices are associated with India-located IP addresses that give the real location away.

To deal with this, the researchers rigged up a Faraday cage, which blocks electromagnetic signals, to isolate the iPad from the other devices and wireless networks around it. They built their aluminum-foil-clad enclosure on top of a regular kitchen microwave and then turned on the microwave whenever they wanted to block signals to the iPad. The setup worked because consumer microwaves heat food using electromagnetic waves that are at the same frequency as Wi-Fi signals—2.4 GHz. Essentially, the researchers had turned their microwave oven into a Wi-Fi jammer.

“We put several layers of aluminum inside and outside [a cardboard box] and we’d see some signal strength drop,” Bansal says. “Of course, it’s not going to be great, but combined with the microwave, it worked.”

Ultimately, the researchers designed a less ingenious, but simpler and more reliable Faraday cage to make their manipulation more practical. With the iPad placed in its own shielded bubble, the researchers used an open source Wi-Fi location database and Wi-Fi SSID cycling tool to trick iOS into locating the iPad in California. With this complete, the AirPods could work as hearing aids in India.

Apple offers the hearing aid features in more than 100 countries, and it has great promise as a tool for making hearing aid tech more accessible—and more palatable—to millions of people around the world. But the company isn’t able to offer the feature everywhere and restricts access in certain countries, like India, likely because of regulatory hurdles related to medical devices. The fact that it’s possible to circumvent these restrictions may offer a solution, at least temporarily, for people in blocked countries who are looking for a workaround.

Apple did not return WIRED’s request for comment about the findings, but the researchers note that it seems like it would be possible for Apple to close the loophole they discovered fairly easily. They say they haven’t heard from the company.

Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity professor at the University of Surrey, says their work is “very interesting” and demonstrates how there may often be ways around “safeguards” put in place by Big Tech. “It shows that those with the technical understanding can bypass the geofencing of apps relatively simply,” Woodward says. “Not that everyone could do it, but they probably know someone that can.”

“I’m not sure how many people realize the number of variants in something like iOS even on what is apparently the same version—the build number is what really matters,” Woodward says. “It’s more a lesson to people that you have more than you realize on your phone.”

Services offered by Big Tech companies such as Apple and Google often have had staggered launches around the world as lawmakers have introduced regulations to control technology companies’ power and protect people’s rights. In the EU, for instance, several AI products have been delayed or not launched due to strict privacy laws. Apple has also been required to allow alternative App Stores due to EU rules. At the same time, right-to-repair movements have grown in popularity, and people have increasingly been hacking into the products they buy.

While the three researchers in India believe that it is likely Apple’s hearing aid features will officially come to the country in the coming months, they plan in the meantime to help the dozens of people they say have reached out to them about their own headphones. They also plan on using the second version of the Faraday cage to set up people’s AirPods. From their own grandmas’ experiences, the hearing aid features appear to be valuable in their everyday lives.

Bansal says his grandma has some hearing loss and other health challenges, but has typically worn hearing aids while watching television. “She used to wear her old clunky hearing aids, and they were really problematic because they had these tiny little buttons on them,” Bansal says. “But now she uses the AirPods, we’ve set it up with her hearing profile, and she can use it to watch the TV just fine and it’s a lot nicer. She doesn’t feel like a patient wearing it.”",Wired,https://www.wired.com/story/apple-airpods-hearing-aid-hack/,2024-11-13 14:07:15.904000-05:00
Best Apple AirPods Max Headphones Deal: Save Up To $90,"The best price is on the Lightning version of the AirPods Max, but the new USB-C edition is also discounted

Apple‘s updated AirPods Max featured some minor updates, including refreshed colorways and the switch from lightning to USB-C. Now the AirPods Max headphones are on sale for as much as $90 off ahead of Black Friday, but there is a catch — the best value is on the older, lightning cable model. You can also save $62 on the USB-C version in the peachy colorway dubbed orange.

Apple’s Lightning AirPods Max are available at this price in black and are under $500 in green or pink.

You can save $62 on the USB-C version of AirPods Max headphones but in fewer colorways.

Apple made the switch to USB-C on the iPhone with last year’s iPhone 15 models, continuing the long, slow phase-out of the lightning cable that began when the EU mandated USB-C as a standard for all phones, tablets, and cameras in 2022. While the US market isn’t covered by EU regulations, Apple opted to adopt the USB-C standard across the board.

In short, if you still have an iPhone with a lightning cable, or you don’t mind having a separate cable for your headphones, then it may be worth the extra $26 discount on Apple’s AirPod Max. If you prefer to make the switch to USB-C and you like the orange colorway, then the smaller discount may be preferable.

The AirPods Max wireless headphones feature active noise cancellation and surround sound-like spatial audio, packaged in a sleek over-ear design that’s comfortable to wear. Powerful ANC lets you tune out busy traffic during commutes or the load hum of the engine on a flight, while Transparency mode keeps you aware when you need to be. The headphones have up to 20 hours of battery life when fully charged.

Like many Amazon deals, pricing and stock can fluctuate unexpectedly, so it’s a good idea to act fast.",Rolling Stone,https://www.rollingstone.com/product-recommendations/electronics/best-apple-airpods-max-headphones-deal-1234588977/,2024-11-01 22:11:25+00:00
"Inside Apple Mac week: New power, smarter AI, bold innovations","Apple's week of Mac announcements kicked off Oct. 28, and all the reveals are now official.

The lineup includes a refreshed iMac with the new M4 chip and updated color options, plus redesigned accessories — keyboard, mouse and trackpad — now featuring USB-C ports.

Apple also announced the rollout of Apple Intelligence, its latest artificial intelligence-powered feature suite for iPhone, iPad and Mac. Alongside these, Apple unveiled a redesigned Mac Mini and the M4 Pro chip.

The new iMac, announced Oct. 28, comes with the M4 chip, featuring an 8-core CPU and up to a 10-core GPU. If you remember Apple’s iPad announcement earlier this year, the M4 chip debuted with the iPad Pro (7th generation).

The new iMac now comes with accessories that use USB-C charging ports instead of Lightning. All USB-C ports also support the fastest Thunderbolt 4 standard, which means you can transfer large videos and other files faster. The display is still a 24-inch panel with 4.5K resolution, but Apple is now offering a ""nano-texture glass"" option for an extra $200, designed to reduce reflections and glare.

There are a few other updates, too. The base RAM has doubled to 16GB from the previous model, with an option to go up to 32GB on the higher-end version. The new iMac also includes a 12MP webcam and introduces Apple Intelligence features, which are finally rolling out. These include AI-powered writing and editing tools and a redesigned Siri, now powered by ChatGPT.

The M4 iMac now comes in new colors, including green, yellow, orange, pink, and purple. Silver remains an option too. It’s available for preorder now, with shipping starting Nov. 8. The entry-level model costs $1,299 and comes with two USB-C ports, while the higher-end models start at $1,499 and include four ports.

As the name suggests, the Mac Mini is a compact computer that can handle some serious workloads. First announced in 2005, it retained the same design until 2010, but Apple finally changed it with the latest model. They’ve shrunk the case, reducing the computer’s volume by half. The new Mini is now a five-inch by five-inch box that’s just two inches tall, while the older model measures 7.75 inches by 7.75 inches and is 1.41 inches thick.

The main upgrade for the new computer is the inclusion of Apple’s latest chips, either the M4 or a more powerful version called the M4 Pro. The M4 Mini comes equipped with two USB-C ports and a headphone jack on the front. These front USB-C ports support USB 3, with speeds of up to 10Gbps.

On the back, you’ll find three USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports (up to 40Gbps), along with Ethernet and HDMI connections. The higher-end M4 Pro model also features Thunderbolt 5 connectivity, which offers transfer speeds of up to 120Gbps and the ability to connect up to three displays.

The starting price of the Mac Mini remains the same at $599. This baseline model comes with the M4 chip featuring 10 CPU cores and 10 GPU cores, along with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. For $799, you can double the SSD to 512GB, while the $999 model bumps the RAM up to 24GB. These are solid prices, which isn’t something I say often about Apple products.

There’s also a $1,399 Mac Mini model that features the new M4 Pro processor, which boasts a 12-core CPU and 16-core GPU. It also supports up to 64GB of RAM and up to an 8TB SSD.

Apple has also dropped some big updates to the MacBook Pro lineup, bringing in more powerful chips and new features. Announced Oct. 30, the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros are now powered by Apple’s new M4 series processors — the M4 Pro and the even higher-end M4 Max. The 14-inch base model now has an extra USB-C/Thunderbolt 4 port on the right side, along with a new space black color option.

Both the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros with M4 Pro and M4 Max are the first Mac laptops to feature Thunderbolt 5 ports, offering faster data transfer and connectivity. They also come equipped with a new 12-megapixel webcam that includes a desk view mode for a wider angle, plus an optional nano-texture display that reaches up to 1,000 nits in SDR and 1,600 nits in HDR.

The M4 Pro-equipped MacBook Pros start at $1,999 for the 14-inch and $2,499 for the 16-inch, both now upgraded from 18GB of base RAM to 24GB — meaning you're getting more memory at the same price. The entry-level 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro still starts at $1,599, but Apple has upped the starting RAM to 16GB (a welcome boost from the previous 8GB). These new MacBook Pros hit stores Nov. 8, and preorders are already open.

Apple’s updates to the Mac lineup bring impressive changes, especially for power users. The new iMacs, now powered by the M4 chip, offer serious performance boosts. But if you’re just using an iMac for general tasks like browsing or light work, you might be better off with an older model to save some cash. The M4 Mac Mini, though, is a great value option with a competitive price and an extra $100 education discount. For those needing even more power, the new M4 MacBook Pros feature both M4 Pro and M4 Max chips, with base RAM now starting at 24GB on the Pro models and 16GB on the entry-level 14-inch version.

What’s also worth mentioning is Apple Intelligence, which Apple announced way back in May but is only now rolling out. I tried some of these features, and while I found them useful, they’re not exactly earth-shattering.

"CFPB expands oversight of digital payments services including Apple Pay, Cash App and PayPal","The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Thursday issued a finalized version of a rule saying it will soon supervise nonbank firms that offer financial services likes payments and wallet apps.

Tech giants and payments firms that handle at least 50 million transactions annually will fall under the review, which is meant to ensure the newer entrants adhere to the laws that banks and credit unions abide by, the CFPB said in a release.

The CFPB said that seven nonbanks qualify for the new scrutiny. Payments services from Apple, Google and Amazon, as well as fintech firms including PayPal and Block and peer-to-peer services Venmo and Zelle are impacted by the change.

While the CFPB already had some authority over digital payment companies because of its oversight of electronic fund transfers, the new rule allows it to treat tech companies more like banks. It makes the firms subject to ""proactive examinations"" to ensure legal compliance, enabling it to demand records and interview employees.

""Digital payments have gone from novelty to necessity and our oversight must reflect this reality,"" said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. ""The rule will help to protect consumer privacy, guard against fraud, and prevent illegal account closures.""

A year ago, the CFPB said it wanted to extend its oversight to tech and fintech companies that offer financial services but that have sidestepped more scrutiny by partnering with banks. Americans are increasingly using payment apps as de facto bank accounts, storing cash and making everyday purchases through their mobile phones.

The most popular apps covered by the rule collectively process more than 13 billion consumer payments a year, and have gained ""particularly strong adoption"" among low- and middle-income users, the CFPB said Thursday.

""What began as a convenient alternative to cash has evolved into a critical financial tool, processing over a trillion dollars in payments between consumers and their friends, families, and businesses,"" the regulator said.

The initial proposal would've subjected companies that process at least 5 million transactions annually to some of the same examinations that the CFPB conducts on banks and credit unions. That threshold got raised to 50 million transactions in the final rule, limiting the expanded powers from roughly 17 companies to just seven, the agency said Thursday.

One of the companies, Zelle, which is owned by Early Warning Services, said it has been supervised by the CFPB and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency since its inception in 2017.

""We operate within the regulatory perimeter, and do so knowing that innovation, security and regulation are not mutually exclusive,"" a spokesperson said.

Payment apps that only work at a particular retailer, like Starbucks, are excluded from the rule.

The new CFPB rule is one of the rare instances where the U.S. banking industry publicly supported the regulator's actions; banks have long felt that tech firms making inroads in financial services ought to be more scrutinized.

The rule ""marks an important step forward for the CFPB to regularly ensure that non-bank market participants actually comply with their obligations to consumers,"" Lindsey Johnson, president of the Consumer Bankers Association, said in an email.

The CFPB said the rule will take effect 30 days after its publication in the Federal Register.

It is not known whether the incoming Trump administration will decide to change or kill the new rule, but it is possible that expanded oversight of tech companies aligns with future CFPB leadership.",CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/21/cfpb-expands-oversight-of-apple-pay-other-digital-payments-services.html,2024-11-21 13:58:14+00:00
The first full reviews are in for Apple's Vision Pro. Here's what people are saying.,"Apple's betting on the Vision Pro headset to be its biggest product launch since the iPhone.

New reviews of the mixed-reality device are out ahead of its US launch on February 2.

Here's what people are saying about it.

There's a lot of hype around the new Apple Vision Pro ahead of its launch in the US this Friday.

Apple reportedly sold out of the headset almost instantly when preorders opened January 19, and has sold around 200,000 units so far, MacRumors reported.

The company is betting on the $3,500 mixed-reality headset to be its biggest product since the iPhone. But does it warrant the hype?

The first full reviews of the headset came out Tuesday. Here's what reviewers had to say about the Vision Pro:

It can be uncomfortable to wear for too long

The headset could get uncomfortable after extended use. The Verge's Nilay Patel said the Vision Pro was ""definitely warm"" after a while. A half-hour in, Mark Spoonauer of Tom's Guide felt it ""weighing on my cheeks.""

The Wall Street Journal's Joanna Stern said the device, made of metal and glass, caused what she called ""face crush."" She noted that her Light Seal cushion, intended to help the headset rest more comfortably on your face and block out light from your surroundings, was ""now covered with makeup"" at the end of her trial.

The displays and video passthrough quality are stunning, with a catch

The headset's displays produce ""vivid, richly colored, HDR and just stunning"" visuals, CNET's Scott Stein wrote.

""Not only is it good enough for movies — something Apple is touting constantly — but it's better than any TV in my house,"" he added.

Patel called it ""the best video passthrough that's ever shipped in a consumer device by far.""

The device's field of view seems to be smaller than that of competitor Meta Quest 3, though.

Stein equated it to ""seeing an amazing monitor through a scuba mask,"" while Patel said there were ""fairly large black borders around what you're seeing, a bit like you're looking through binoculars.""

EyeSight and Personas look offputting

The overwhelming consensus is that the Vision Pro's depictions of the user to other people are … weird.

Related stories

First, there's EyeSight, which shows a digital version of your eyes to others looking at you while you're wearing the headset.

Patel calls it ""a low-res, ghostly image of [your eyes] that feels like CGI."" Stern said it was ""very subtle"" and ""a bit gimmicky.""

There's also your Persona, which is a digital avatar of yourself that appears in FaceTime calls. Patel called the avatars ""deeply weird and extremely uncanny,"" and Stern said hers would ""haunt your dreams,"" with one of her colleagues likening it to ""Botox from hell.""

CNBC's Todd Haselton and Spoonauer said their avatars significantly aged them.

It's great for entertainment like watching movies …

Reviewers seemed to have a positive experience watching movies on the Vision Pro.

""Between the big screen and immersive spatial audio, the only thing I was missing was theater seats,"" Stern wrote.

Spoonauer said the headset would ""make even the biggest skeptic a believer in 3D movies.""

Multiple reviewers said the sound quality was great but to beware that it leaks, so others around you may hear what you're listening to if you don't use earbuds.

… but falls short at some aspects of work, like typing

The Vision Pro's floating virtual keyboard lets you type in thin air without any physical keys at your fingertips, but it was a resounding flop to reviewers.

""It will drive you mad for anything longer than a short message,"" Stern said. Spoonauer likened it to ""a peck-peck-peck scenario with one or two hands,"" and Patel called the keyboard outright ""hilarious.""

However, the Vision Pro fared better for other work purposes.

Haselton said it presented ""a completely new way to multitask.""

""You can open mail and a browser or leave Slack open next to a Word document with your calendar on the other side. Put your text messages on the ceiling if you want,"" he wrote.

Spoonauer felt he ""could see myself taking the Vision Pro on business trips and using it back at the hotel.""

Closing thoughts

So what were the reviewers' big takeaways?

""While it has some shortcomings, it's easily the most fun new product I've tried out in years,"" Haselton said.

Stein said Apple beat out its competition in having a seamless input experience.

""Other headsets have eye tracking and hand tracking, but none have the combination working as smoothly, subtly and intuitively as the Vision Pro,"" he wrote.

There's also the matter of juggling real and virtual worlds with the device.

Stein talked about the risk of ""isolation"" in his review.

""While the Vision Pro creates presence by showing the real world through its passthrough cameras, or even replicas of my eyes, it also allows me to close these off, even sealing my audio world completely with AirPods,"" he wrote. ""I can be in my own world, inches from my own family.""

Stern called the Vision Pro ""the best mixed-reality headset I've ever tried, way more advanced than its only real competition, the far cheaper Meta Quest Pro and Quest 3.""

Patel called the Vision Pro ""a VR headset masquerading as an AR headset.""

""There's not a lot of reality being augmented in the rest of visionOS. There's an awful lot of what you might call mixed reality: virtual objects floating around in space with no connection to anything real,"" he wrote. ""This is the best anyone has ever made in there look, and it's still not nearly as good as out here.""

Warren Buffett acumula más efectivo mientras Berkshire Hathaway sigue vendiendo acciones de Apple,"OMAHA, Nebraska, EE.UU. (AP) — Warren Buffett ahora tiene más de 325.000 millones de dólares en efectivo después de seguir vendiendo miles de millones de dólares en acciones de Apple y Bank of America este año y seguir recaudando un flujo constante de ganancias de todos los negocios variados de la sociedad de cartera Berkshire Hathaway sin encontrar grandes adquisiciones.

Berkshire informó que vendió alrededor de 100 millones más de acciones de Apple en el tercer trimestre luego de haber reducido a la mitad su masiva inversión en el fabricante del iPhone el trimestre pasado. La participación restante de aproximadamente 300 millones de acciones, que tenía un valor de 69.900 millones de dólares al final de septiembre, sigue siendo la mayor inversión individual de Berkshire, pero se ha reducido drásticamente desde finales del año pasado, cuando valía 174.300 millones de dólares.

Los inversores también estarán decepcionados al saber que Berkshire no recompró ninguna de sus propias acciones en el trimestre.

La analista de CFRA Research, Cathy Seifert, dijo que los accionistas se preguntarán por qué Buffett sigue acumulando tanto efectivo.

”¿Son más pesimistas sobre el futuro económico y del mercado de lo que quizás otros lo son?” cuestionó.

Buffett explicó en la reunión anual en mayo que parte de la razón por la que comenzó a vender algunas de sus acciones de Apple es que espera que las tasas de impuestos sean más altas en el futuro. Pero el analista de Edward Jones, Jim Shanahan, se pregunta si parte de la razón por la que Buffett comenzó a vender las acciones de Apple está vinculada a la muerte el año pasado del vicepresidente Charlie Munger, dado que las ventas iniciaron poco después de la muerte de Munger. Shanahan aseveró que Buffett nunca se ha sentido tan cómodo con los negocios tecnológicos como lo estaba su socio de toda la vida.

“Si Charlie Munger siguiera vivo, quizás no habría reducido la posición tan agresivamente -tal vez nada en absoluto”, destacó Shanahan.

Berkshire indicó el sábado que las ganancias de inversión impulsaron nuevamente sus utilidades del tercer trimestre a 26.250 millones de dólares, o 18,272 dólares por acción Clase A. Hace un año, las pérdidas de inversión no realizadas arrastraron las ganancias del conglomerado con sede en Omaha, Nebraska, a una pérdida de 12.770 millones de dólares, o 8,824 dólares por acción Clase A.

Buffett ha recomendado durante mucho tiempo que los inversores presten más atención a las ganancias operativas de Berkshire si quieren tener una buena idea de cómo están funcionando los negocios que posee, porque esos números excluyen las inversiones. Las cifras de ganancias netas de Berkshire pueden variar ampliamente de un trimestre a otro junto con el valor de sus inversiones, independientemente de si la compañía compró o vendió algo.

Según esa medida, Berkshire afirmó que sus ganancias operativas sólo disminuyeron alrededor del 6% a 10.090 millones de dólares, o 7,023.01 dólares por acción Clase A. Eso se compara con los 10.800 millones de dólares del año pasado, o 7,437.15 dólares por acción Clase A.

Los cuatro analistas encuestados por FactSet Research predijeron que Berkshire reportará ganancias operativas de 7,335.11 dólares por acción Clase A.

Los ingresos de Berkshire no cambiaron mucho en 92.995 millones de dólares. Hace un año, informó ingresos de 93.210 millones de dólares. Esa cifra fue superior a los 92.231 millones de dólares en ingresos que tres analistas encuestados por FactSet predijeron.

Berkshire posee un surtido de negocios de seguros, incluido Geico, junto con el ferrocarril BNSF, varias grandes empresas de servicios públicos y una variada colección de negocios de venta al por menor y manufactura, incluyendo marcas como Dairy Queen y See’s Candy.",Associated Press News,https://apnews.com/article/buffett-hathaway-apple-acciones-d93ed640dad02f6e50f9175e8b02a05c,2024-11-03 02:51:18+00:00
The Scopes Trial and the Two Visions of US Democracy,"The Scopes trial and the battle over religion in US politics.

A new history revisits “the Trial of the Century” and its legacy in contemporary politics.

Why should we care about “the Trial of the Century” nearly a century after it happened? Many Americans have long understood the 1925 prosecution of John Scopes in Dayton, Tennessee, for breaking a new state law that forbade teaching “the Evolution Theory” in public schools as a conflict of profound simplicity in which religious bigotry clashed with scientific reason. In it, Clarence Darrow, a veteran stalwart of the legal left, skillfully defended Scopes, a biology instructor, while William Jennings Bryan, a thrice-failed nominee for president and devout fundamentalist, clumsily led the case for the state. The trial was broadcast to the entire the nation over an enterprising radio hookup.

Since Scopes freely admitted he had done the deed as charged, the guilty verdict came as no surprise. But what the court case achieved was something else: After Darrow put Bryan on the stand and humiliated him by exposing his lack of curiosity about both evolution and the Bible, many who had followed the trial concluded that the defense had won that round of the culture wars. The peerless and pitiless H.L. Mencken attended the trial and was among them: He hissed to his many readers that Bryan was “deluded by a childish theology, full of an almost pathological hatred of all learning, all human dignity, all beauty, all fine and noble things. He was a peasant come home to the barnyard.” The 1960 film Inherit the Wind powerfully dramatized that opinion for countless kids (like me) who saw it in liberal classrooms and on TV during that decade and beyond.

In her new history of the trial, Keeping the Faith, Brenda Wineapple freshens this familiar narrative and suggests that something different, if equally momentous, was at stake during the weeklong proceedings at a redbrick county courthouse in the foothills of the Appalachians. While arguing about the Butler Act, the state law that censored the teaching of biology, each side was also setting forth a firmly held conception of democracy. “To Bryan,” Wineapple writes, “democracy meant majority rule and states’ rights. The people in each state should decide for themselves…what should be taught in state-supported schools.” But for Darrow, “there could be no democracy without reason, which is to say, without education and an educated people.” They fought for their clashing faiths in democracy at the court and everywhere newspapers were read and radios heard. Each man and his allies feared for the nation’s future if they could not persuade the public to take their side. And it is hard not to hear the echoes of a contemporary conflict in these fears as well: between citizens who demand a set of policy measures to “make America great”—and Christian—“again” and those who believe that civic tolerance and the freedom to speak and teach the truth are what give Americans the potential to live up to the nation’s vaunted, if abstract, ideals.

To explain how the Scopes trial became such a prominent affair, Wineapple devotes nearly half her text to the individuals and movements, intellectual and political, that preceded and presaged it. She offers chapters on the Populist revolt of the 1890s and about Prohibition and the revival of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s. She describes the dispute among Protestant churchmen about whether to embrace the work of Charles Darwin or condemn it. Nietzsche gets her attention too, since Mencken praised him as “the high priest of the actual,” while Bryan warned that his “philosophy would convert the world into a ferocious conflict between beasts.”

On occasion, these contextual forays seem tangential to the background of the trial itself. What bearing did Mencken’s sympathy for Germany during World War I have on his contempt for the foes of Darwinism? But Wineapple uses them as a backdrop for the main focus of her book: the famous individuals who shaped her particular period of history. Here she excels at portraying them as if they were characters in an entertaining screenplay. No one has written a richer or more dramatic narrative of the trial or its leading combatants than Wineapple has in Keeping the Faith. An esteemed biographer of Hawthorne, Genet, and the siblings Gertrude and Leon Stein, she deftly traces the long roads the two main antagonists took to Dayton.

These paths sometimes even crossed. By the mid-1920s, Darrow had spent nearly four decades defending beleaguered figures on the left and the labor movement against their potent foes. Before the Supreme Court, he represented Eugene Debs, who had spearheaded a national railroad strike that was crushed by federal troops. He won an acquittal for Big Bill Haywood, a leader of a Western miners’ union accused of killing the anti-labor governor of Idaho. Darrow considered becoming a politician himself but decided he could do more for the cause by continuing to perform quite remarkably in court: Into late middle age, “the attorney for the damned” could address a jury both cogently and eloquently for an hour or more without glancing at a single note. And he never took himself too seriously. “When a reporter teased him about his rumpled clothes,” Wineapple writes, Darrow responded, “‘I buy just as good clothes as you boys do, only I sleep in mine.’”

A major-party politician, Bryan never warmed up to radicals, but he constantly pursued reforms that aimed to make the United States a more egalitarian land—at least for its white majority. Campaigning as the Democratic nominee for president in 1896, 1900, and 1908, he called for a progressive income tax and the federal regulation of banks and opposed the forceful colonization of the Philippines. In his final campaign, he won the endorsement of the American Federation of Labor—the first time that mainstream body of unions had ever backed a contender for the White House.

Not until he ceased running for office did Bryan begin crusading for causes that Darrow opposed: the prohibition of the commerce in alcohol and the squelching of teaching about evolution in public schools. In 1915, he also resigned his position as secretary of state to protest President Woodrow Wilson’s angry notes to Germany, which Bryan thought would lead the United States to enter the First World War. Darrow, by contrast, cheered on the Allied cause soon after the conflict began the previous summer.

Darrow and Bryan also parted ways on the matter of racial equality. Unlike the celebrated trial attorney, “the Great Commoner” was a lifelong exponent of Jim Crow. That nearly all white Democrats then shared his racist convictions underlined the fact that their passion for equality always cooled at the color line. Wineapple even suggests that Bryan’s belief in white supremacy may, in part, have stirred his hatred of Darwinism: “the theory of evolution helped make indefensible the notion that racial hierarchies could be fixed, separate, and consigned to hierarchies of superior and inferior,” she writes.

There was another reason Bryan decided to make the Scopes trial what became his final stand. Part of his zeal to prosecute Scopes stemmed from his confused understanding of what evolutionists had discovered and believed. For Bryan, Darwinism was always social Darwinism: He feared that students who imbibed it as scientific truth would come to believe that human beings were nothing but animals who survived through violence and hatred and would have no reason to care for what he called “the weak and the helpless” among them. Bryan even blamed evolutionists for turning eugenics into a reputable solution to the “problem” of what the textbook Civic Biology called “immorality and feeble-mindedness.” On this Bryan was not entirely wrong, for it was that very textbook that Scopes had taught in his class at Dayton High.

Yet no matter what drew Bryan to the case, his prosecution of Scopes ultimately hinged on a set of religious arguments: He kept insisting on opposing scientific theories based on mere “guesses” against the rock of religion instead of pointing out the nefarious uses to which evolutionary science could be put. This misstep allowed Darrow and the other members of his team to shift the court’s attention away from questions of society and to instead focus on how the Butler Act erroneously assumed that a believer in evolution could not also be a devout Christian.

Dudley Field Malone—Darrow’s dapper co-counsel—gave a brilliant speech arguing for experts to be allowed to testify about the facts of evolution. The Bible is a wonderful book, he acknowledged, but it is not a work of science. “Keep it as your consolation,” he advised the jury, “keep it as your guide, but keep it where it belongs, in the world of your own conscience…in the world of the Protestant conscience that I heard so much about when I was a boy.”

When Malone finished speaking, the courtroom, packed with supporters of the prosecution, erupted in cheers. Bryan even walked up to congratulate Malone, who had served under him at the State Department, for delivering “the greatest speech I have ever heard.” But the judge refused to allow any scientists to take the stand. All that was at issue, he ruled, was whether Scopes had broken the law.

If the proceedings had ended there, it is unlikely that the trial would have resonated in memory for so long or been the subject of so much controversy. But the day after the judge shot down the chance for the jury to hear about evolution, the defense announced that it was calling Bryan to the stand as a reputed expert on the Bible. Bryan agreed, on the condition that he could later question Darrow as well.

Darrow’s rapid queries were so effective because they exposed how little his opponent had thought about the claims of the book to which he swore unqualified faith. For two hours, the defense attorney grilled Bryan about the trustworthiness of Scripture. “Do you believe a whale swallowed Jonah?” “Do you believe Joshua made the sun stand still?” “Do you think the earth was made in six days?”

Bryan avoided giving an unqualified assent to any of these questions. He admitted that the whale could actually have been just “a large fish” that God had perhaps not told to ingest a man. Neither did he speculate about how the Lord had suspended the laws of physics long enough to stop the rotation of the earth. His answers came off as evasive and defensive. Bryan knew much of the Bible by heart, but he had not studied it as would a theologian eager to correct errors of logic or judgment. On the stump and on the page, he had moved people by describing how faith in Scripture could comfort humanity and the creation of a just and peaceful world. But unable or unwilling to debate the truth of either biology or the Bible, he was no match for a shrewd adversary who asked probing questions and would not let up.

“The purpose” of Darrow’s cross-examination “is to cast ridicule on everybody who believes in the Bible,” Bryan wailed. No, shouted Darrow, “we have the purpose of preventing bigots and ignoramuses from controlling the education of the United States, and you know it.” Scopes would be found guilty, but Bryan had lost the intellectual debate. Despite his reputation as a fierce defender of the faith, his performance on the stand under Darrow’s “interrogation,” as Wineapple writes, was “sad and ridiculous, operatic and futile.” The next day, the defense and the prosecution agreed to end the trial. Bryan would have no opportunity to cross-examine Darrow.

The duel in Dayton would be the last time either man commanded a sizable national audience. Bryan died in his sleep the Sunday after the trial ended. The timing ensured that he would always be remembered for the worst moment in a career he had begun as a populist congressman from Nebraska in the early 1890s. Still, he kept enough respect among Democrats that, in 1934, President Franklin Roosevelt lauded Bryan at an unveiling of his statue alongside the Potomac River.

Darrow’s last big trial occurred toward the end of the same year that Scopes was convicted. It was the trial of Ossian Sweet, a Black physician, and a group of his brothers and friends. One of them had killed a member of a white mob, numbering in the thousands, that had sought to violently drive the Sweet family out of their home in a Detroit neighborhood that had barred African Americans from living there before. Darrow’s ardent plea to the all-white jury to dispense “justice” to an “often maligned and down-trodden” race helped acquit his clients. When Darrow died, in 1938, The Chicago Defender, a leading Black newspaper, eulogized “his ability to regard all men as his brothers: a task and a responsibility which seems incapable of comprehension by those who profess to hold opposite religious views from those of himself.” The Defender added: “This should teach the white church a lesson.”

Today, religion is just as central to the struggle over the meaning of democracy in America as it was in that Tennessee country courthouse in 1925. But it now has a strongly partisan flavor. Republicans who claim to speak for the Christian majority applaud states that ban abortion and transgender surgery and remove books about LGBTQ people from school libraries. Teaching creationism, thankfully, is no longer high on the right wing’s cultural agenda. Democrats point to polls and election results that reveal that most voters favor a woman’s right to decide on her own healthcare and trust librarians to choose a range of books for children to read. Ironically, the most powerful official in each party professes to be a devout Christian: House Speaker Mike Johnson asserts that his “worldview” is the Bible, while President Biden attends Mass nearly every week.

Just as a century ago, neither side has any taste for compromise. For the broad, largely secular left, the good news is that white evangelicals—the solid base of the GOP—number only about 14 percent of the population; in Bryan’s day, they were probably close to a majority. But if Donald Trump wins this fall, religious conservatives will likely get their way on a variety of decisions by the executive branch concerning issues they hold dear.

Culture wars seldom end with a settlement that pleases both sets of belligerents, and until the left or the right wins a lasting victory, the United States will remain a society rent in two over the role of religion in our politics. But progressives used to appeal to large numbers of serious Christians, and the only practical approach to convincing, or neutralizing, any number of believers with whom one disagrees is to find a way to empathize with—or at the very least tolerate—their fears, while routinely defeating their favored candidates at the polls. “Tolerance,” Clarence Darrow explained at the end of the Scopes trial, “means a willingness to let other people do, think, act and live as we think is not right; the antithesis of this is intolerance and means we demand the right to make others live as we think is right, not as they think is right.” We have an excellent name for a system that allows ordinary people to make their own decisions about what a minority of others would force them to do.

The 32 Best Shows on Apple TV+ Right Now (November 2024),"Silo, Disclaimer, and Slow Horses are among the best shows on Apple TV+ this month.

Slowly but surely, Apple TV+ has found its feet. The streaming service, which at launch we called “odd, angsty, and horny as hell,” has evolved into a diverse library of dramas, documentaries, and comedies. Now, its library is so packed, we’ve declared it “the new HBO.”

Curious but don’t know where to get started? Below are our picks for the best shows on the service. (Also, here are our picks for the best movies on Apple TV+.) When you’re done, head over to our guides to the best shows on Netflix, best movies on Hulu, and best movies on Amazon Prime, because you can never have too much television.

Silo

As WIRED noted in the wake of Silo's release, this show is prestige sci-fi gold. More than a year later, that’s still true—and it is poised to get even better. Based on a dystopian book trilogy by Hugh Howey, the series focuses on a subterranean bunker—the silo of the title—where humanity has sequestered itself after the apocalypse. Some are hoping to win the chance to reproduce, some are trying to solve mysterious murders. Everyone watching is enjoying figuring out what's going on in this underground city, and what's happening outside of it. Its second season, out November 15, promises to be even better than the first. If you haven’t been watching, start now.

Disclaimer

When filmmaking legend Alfonso Cuarón (Gravity) decides to do a limited series starring Cate Blanchett, you kind of owe it to yourself to watch. Especially when, as Cuarón told WIRED, the Renée Knight novel the series is based on was so intriguing it made him want to bring his cinematic skills to a TV miniseries. In the seven-part series, Blanchett plays an esteemed journalist named Catherine who is sent a mysterious novel that threatens to expose parts of her past she'd hidden for years. As she tries to investigate who wrote the book, she also must keep her own life from collapsing around her. Cuarón adapted the novel himself and directed each episode of the series, bringing his big-screen style to the small-screen world.

Shrinking

Do you enjoy In Treatment but wish it was, you know, fun? Then Shrinking may be right for you. Created by Bill Lawrence and Brett Goldstein—of Ted Lasso fame—and Jason Segel, the show follows Jimmy (Segel), a therapist struggling to get over the death of his wife and reconnect with his daughter and patients. That may sound like a downer, but it’s buoyed by the fact that it’s also a workplace comedy focusing on the therapy practice where Jimmy works alongside Harrison Ford’s Paul and Jessica Williams’ Gaby. Shrinking, ultimately, is about the things people do to cope, but it also features a dream team of a cast and one very memorable party scene featuring a vomit-soaked piano and a super-stoned Ford. With one season under its belt and a second rolling out now, it's the perfect show to spend some time on the couch with.

Slow Horses

As we wrote not too long ago, Slow Horses is the ideal show for people who want a Pizza Hut-Taco Bell-esque combination of John Le Carré–style espionage thrillers and The Office. Based around the misfits of Slough House, where MI5 agents are sent when they biff it as spies, the show effortlessly jumps from shoot-outs and car chases to quirky conversations and camaraderie. The show’s fourth season, which launched in summer 2024, is a little more subdued than the ones before, but if you've been sleeping on Slow Horses, now is the time to wake up.

Bad Monkey

Created by Bill Lawrence, one of the creative forces behind two other Apple TV+ zingers, Ted Lasso and Shrinking, Bad Monkey is about a one-time detective (played by Vince Vaughn) who’s hit a bit of a rough patch and is trying to get to the bottom of why someone found a severed arm. Yes, there's a monkey, but there's also a lot of dark humor and heart—and a look at the complex lives of more than a few Florida Men.

Sunny

Need some dark comedy/drama/sci-fi while you wait for the next season of Severance? Then Apple TV+’s other “S”-titled show may be right for you. Sunny is the story of a woman named Suzie (Rashida Jones) whose husband and son are lost in a mysterious plane crash. To work through her grief, Suzie is given Sunny, a domestic robot with whom she forms a unique bond as she begins to uncover what happened to her family. As artificial intelligence gets more and more ingrained in everyone’s lives, Sunny promises to hit differently now than it would at any other time.

Presumed Innocent

Just to be clear, this whodunit has been done before. Thirty-four years ago, Harrison Ford starred in the film adaptation of Scott Turow’s novel. This time around, the lead is played by Jake Gyllenhaal, and the adaptation is an eight-part limited series, not a film. Gyllenhaal stars as Rusty Sabich, a Chicago prosecutor accused of killing a colleague. A colleague with whom he was having an affair. Presumed Innocent is produced by David E. Kelley, so it has the intrigue and glossiness of his recent offerings like Big Little Lies and The Undoing, as well as the darkness and drama.

STEVE! (martin) A Documentary in 2 Pieces

Putting this on the “best shows on Apple TV+” list is a bit of a cheat. Rather than a series, this two-part documentary is more like a pair of movies looking at the life and career of Steve Martin. The first part chronicles his rise in, and reimagining of, the standup comedy world. The second looks at how he went from that to the neurotic and lovable neighbor he currently plays on Only Murders in the Building, which would be his career’s triumphant second act if he hadn’t had something like 30 acts in between. Directed by Morgan Neville, who made the backup singer documentary 20 Feet From Stardom and the Fred Rogers doc Won’t You Be My Neighbor?, it’s funny, intimate, and a little surprising—just like Martin himself.

Loot

OK, so Loot isn't exactly about MacKenzie Scott's divorce from Jeff Bezos, but it is about a woman named Molly (Maya Rudolph) who separates from her tech billionaire husband and devotes herself to philanthropic work. Also, creators Alan Yang (Master of None) and Matt Hubbard (Superstore) were kind of inspired by Bezos and Scott's split. With an incredible supporting cast that includes Joel Kim Booster, Michaela Jaé Rodriguez, and Adam Scott, it's a quirky comedy with a lot of heart—and the kind of thing you (probably) won't see on Amazon Prime Video.

The Big Door Prize

With The Big Door Prize Chris O'Dowd finally got the “guy leading a show” role he was always meant for. In the series, he plays a 40-year-old high school teacher named Dusty who's pretty content with his life until a magic machine shows up in his small town. The machine, you see, tells people their life's potential, and as soon as folks around him start using it, everything changes. Marriages end, paths divert, and eventually Dusty must confront whether he's happy in his own life.

The Completely Made-Up Adventures of Dick Turpin

Dick Turpin was a real highwayman in 18th-century England who was ultimately executed for horse theft. But the myths surrounding him are far more interesting than the facts. The Completely Made-Up Adventures of Dick Turpin, true to its name, opts to stick with the fun stuff. Starring Noel Fielding (The Great British Bake Off) in the title role, this six-episode series presents Turpin as someone who stumbled into leading a group of outlaws and made the best of it. Enjoy the ride.

Constellation

Around here we have a theory that Apple TV+ is the new HBO. At the same time, we also wonder among ourselves whether it’s the new Syfy. After opening with a bang in 2019 with For All Mankind, it has released a steady drumbeat of trippy, spacey, timey-wimey prestige shows, from Foundation to Severance. In early 2024, it released Constellation, an eight-part thriller about an astronaut (Noomi Rapace) who returns to Earth after a disaster in space to find things are very off. Brain-bending and tense, it’s the kind of sci-fi that sucks you in.

Masters of the Air

Generally speaking, “World War II drama” and Steven Spielberg are probably enough to get anyone to click Play on this series, but it’s got a lot more than just a good elevator pitch. Based on Donald L. Miller’s Masters of the Air, this series dives deep into the lives of the 100th Bomb Group—aka the “Bloody Hundredth”—a squad of pilots tasked with risking their lives to fight Nazi Germany from the air. Spielberg and Tom Hanks serve as executive producers, and the cast features Elvis himself, Austin Butler, as well as Saltburn’s Barry Keoghan and Doctor Who’s latest Doctor, Ncuti Gatwa.

The New Look

Keeping with the World War II theme, The New Look follows Christian Dior, Coco Chanel, Pierre Balmain, and Cristóbal Balenciaga as they lay the path for modern fashion in Nazi-occupied Paris. The cast features Ben Mendelsohn as Christian Dior, Juliette Binoche as Coco Chanel, and Maisie Williams as Catherine Dior, and also has a soundtrack courtesy of Jack Antonoff that’s chock full of early 20th-century music covered by the likes of Perfume Genius and Florence Welch.

Criminal Record

Starring former Doctor Who Doctor Peter Capaldi, Criminal Record follows two cops—Capaldi’s Daniel Hegarty and Cush Jumbo’s June Lenker—as they try to get to the bottom of a long-settled case. Daniel worked the case originally and got a confession; June got a fresh tip and wants him to reopen it and find out whether the man who went away for murder is actually innocent. Might sound a bit overdone, but the series also works in elements of law enforcement shortcomings and race in a rapidly-changing Britain for a series that’s about more than just one case.

Hijack

There’s this face Idris Elba does. He’s been perfecting it since he was Stringer Bell on The Wire. It’s the look of total calm even when he’s talking about the most harrowing thing you can imagine. That face gets a full workout in Hijack, in which Elba plays a corporate negotiator who finds himself trying to settle things with a group of, yes, hijackers who have taken over the flight he’s boarded to get home to his family. This series is seven episodes, roughly seven hours—the same length of the flight, and it follows the drama in the air and the political maneuvering below before attempting to stick the landing. Do stay around until the end.

For All Mankind

Long before Foundation, there was For All Mankind. The show not only set the tone for the kind of glossy prestige sci-fi Apple TV+ had ambitions to make, but it was also the streaming service's attempt to plant its flag in the realm of streaming giants. A solid slice of alternate history, the show starts with a very smart premise: What if the US had been edged out in putting a man on the moon? How would the space-race rivalry between the Americans and the Soviets have played out? It's mostly a slick, stylish, NASA-heavy period drama, but as this is from the brain of Ronald D. Moore, there are a few standout moments and episodes with attention shared around the large ensemble cast. It might be the best sci-fi show you're not watching, and if that's true you now have multiple seasons to catch up on.

Messi Meets America

If your home screen hasn't made it obvious, Apple TV+ is super stoked about soccer. Messi Meets America is a six-part docuseries about all-star player Lionel Messi's move to Major League Soccer's Inter Miami club. The first three episodes aired on October 11, 2023, and subsequent episodes aired in conjunction with last year's MLS season. Messi Mania, indeed.

Lessons in Chemistry

Based on the debut novel from science writer Bonnie Garmus, Lessons in Chemistry is the story of Elizabeth Zott (Brie Larson), who gets hired to host a cooking show after she's fired from her lab for doing science while female. Obviously, the show Elizabeth puts on ends up being about a lot more than just having dinner on the table at 6 pm, but we suggest you watch to find out just how revolutionary it is.

The Morning Show

Every streaming service needs a flashy mainstream drama with Hollywood heavyweights to pull in viewers. Apple TV+ has The Morning Show. When Alex Levy (Jennifer Aniston) loses her morning news program cohost Mitch Kessler (Steve Carell) following sexual misconduct accusations, she gets paired up with Bradley Jackson (Reese Witherspoon). What unfolds is a #MeToo-era drama full of TV network intrigue and Sorkin-lite dialog. In its second season, it went deep on Covid-19, and in the third season the series' fictional network, UBA, finds itself dealing with the aftermath of a cyberattack. There's likely a new season coming in 2025, so now's a good time to catch up, or go back and refresh your memory.

Shining Girls

This Elisabeth Moss psychological thriller/murder mystery came out in 2022 and never really got the buzz it likely deserved. Moss plays Kirby, a woman who believes a recent Chicago murder may be linked to an attack on her many years prior. She teams with a Sun-Times reporter to investigate, but the deeper she digs the more her own reality starts to shift. Based on the book The Shining Girls by Lauren Beukes, this series may seem like just another murder mystery, but its sci-fi twists put it one step ahead.

Foundation

WIRED called Foundation a “flawed masterpiece” in our review of the first season. Considering the complexities of adapting a sprawling Isaac Asimov book series, it was high praise. Starring Jared Harris as Hari Seldon, a math professor who, along with his loyal followers, is exiled for predicting the oncoming end of the galactic empire that rules over them, the show often suffers under the weight of its own massive scope. But it also features wonderful performances from Lee Pace and beautiful images inspired by the James Webb Space Telescope. If you have a soft spot for big sci-fi dramas, this Game-of-Thrones-in-space wannabe is a must-watch.

The Crowded Room

Set in the late 1970s, The Crowded Room stars Tom Holland as Danny Sullivan, a young man arrested after a grisly shooting in New York City. Following his arrest, this 10-episode limited series unfolds into a twisty whodunit as interrogator Rya Goodwin (Amanda Seyfried) tries to suss out what happened with the shooting and the peculiar events in Sullivan’s past that may have shaped how he ended up involved. Holland told Extra that the shoot for The Crowded Room, which he also produced, “broke” him, leading to him taking a yearlong hiatus from acting. Want to see why? Watch now.

Ted Lasso

On paper, Ted Lasso sounds terrible. It's the inconceivable story of an American football coach who has never watched a game of soccer somehow landing himself a job as coach of a (fictional) Premier League club and trying to make up for his total lack of qualifications by being a nice guy. Sounds unwatchable, doesn’t it? And yet Ted Lasso has captured the hearts and minds of viewers on both sides of the pond with its large-as-life cast and irresistibly wholesome messaging, hoovering up awards in the process. The third season hit the streamer in 2023.

High Desert

The Patricia Arquette–aissance doesn’t get as much ink as Matthew McConaughey or Keanu Reeves did during their second comings, but it’s here—in part thanks to the rise of streaming. Between The Act and Severance, Arquette has received some of the highest accolades of her long career recently, and High Desert is no exception. While coming to terms with the death of her mother, Peggy (Arquette)—an addict—decides she wants to pick up the pieces of her life and become a private investigator. She finds an unwitting employer/sometime mentor in Bruce Harvey (Brad Garrett), but not everyone is onboard with Peggy’s career decisions—namely, her straitlaced sister (Christine Taylor). It’s an odd duck of a show, which is perfectly suited to Arquette’s ethereal acting style, allowing her to seamlessly flit between moments of tragedy and laugh-out-loud comedy, with the audiences doing their best to keep up. The all-star cast is made even more impressive by recurring appearances from Bernadette Peters as Peggy’s late mom.

Big Beasts

Look, Discovery doesn't get to corner the market on animal documentaries—and this 10-part docuseries proves it. Featuring elephant seals, brown bears, orangutans, giant otters, and all kinds of massive mammals in between, it's the perfect thing if you just want to escape and learn a few tidbits about nature. But the best part? It's narrated by Tom Hiddleston, and there's just something charming about hearing the voice of Loki talk about a bunch of different animals he could turn himself into in the blink of an eye.

Servant

Cinematically, M. Night Shyamalan can be a little hit-or-miss, but Servant, which the filmmaker executive produces and occasionally directs, is stellar. It's about a Philadelphia couple—a chef and a news anchor—who lose a child only to have it mysteriously come back to life (maybe) with the arrival of their new nanny. (You really just need to watch the show for any of this to make sense.) Moody, freaky, and occasionally even funny, it'll suck you in. With four seasons on the streamer, there’s plenty to enjoy.

The Essex Serpent

Claire Danes doing her best trembling-chin acting in period garb, Tom Hiddleston as a town vicar, rumors about a mysterious mythological serpent—is there anything not to love about this show? No, there’s not. The Essex Serpent, based on the novel by Sarah Perry, follows a recent widow (Danes) as she heads to the countryside in Essex to investigate a “sea dragon.” There, she meets a vicar, Will (Hiddleston), who is far more skeptical of the serpent’s existence. Lush and inviting, it’s the ideal period mystery.

Severance

Out of all the shows on this list, Severance may be the one that firmly established Apple TV+ as a streaming player with edgy prestige content. Adam Scott plays Mark, a man distraught by the death of his wife who opts to undergo Severance, a procedure that divides his memories of work from those of his life at home. He’s quite happy with the setup until a former Lumon Industries coworker tracks him down when he’s out-of-office, setting off a series of events that makes him question not only Severance but the work his company does. From there, it only gets more weird and bleak with each passing minute. Tense and heartbreaking, this show, the bulk of which was directed by Ben Stiller, will keep you guessing and questioning the whole way through.

Mythic Quest

An all-too-rare example of a video game TV show that really works, Mythic Quest is one of the best new workplace comedies of the past few years. Presented in perfectly bingeable half-hour episodes, the show follows a fictional game studio known for its World of Warcraft–like MMO, Mythic Quest, as the people who make it slalom through their many quirky relationships. The writing is excellent, consistently funny and emotionally impactful when you least expect it, and the show manages to confront real issues in the industry without sacrificing laughs.

Dickinson

Hailee Steinfeld is a riotous young Emily Dickinson in this half-hour show from creator Alena Smith. It was part of the original Apple TV+ lineup and quickly distinguished itself thanks to its off-kilter vision of 19th-century Amherst, Massachusetts. The first season is a set of sharp, surreal vignettes, inspired by Dickinson's work and tracing the imagined life of the young poet, who is rebelling against her father, the town's societal rules, and just about everything else. The second and third seasons go deeper, examining not only the poet's life, but also the roles that race, gender, sexuality, and class played in the early days of America. If you're a Dickinson stan, love a bit of smart queer dramedy, or just have a penchant for a modern soundtrack in a Civil War–era show, you’ll dig this.",Wired,https://www.wired.com/story/best-apple-tv-plus-shows/,2023-01-24 07:00:00-05:00
One Tech Tip: Replacing passwords with passkeys for an easier login experience,"LONDON (AP) — If you’re tired of memorizing passwords, then give passkeys a try.

You might have noticed that many online services are now offering the option of using passkeys, a digital authentication method touted as an easier and more secure way to log in. The passkey push started gaining major momentum after Google started accepting them about 18 months ago.

Passkeys are seen as eventual replacements for passwords, but if you’re still not sure what they’re all about, read on:

What are passkeys? And how do they work?

Forget about memorizing an optimized 14 character password consisting of letters, numbers and symbols. Passkeys do away with that because you never need to see them. Instead you are using existing biometrics like your face or fingerprints, digital patterns or PINs to access your accounts.

Passkeys are made up of two parts of a code that only makes sense when they’re combined, kind of like a digital key and padlock. You keep half of the encrypted code, typically stored either in the cloud with a compatible password manager or on a physical security dongle. The other half is stored on the participating apps, services or accounts you want to access.

When you want to log in to your Gmail account, for example, both parts of the code will then communicate directly with each other and give you entry.

Do they offer better security?

A passkey won’t work with any website except the one it has been created for, eliminating the security risks associated with traditional passwords.

That means bad actors carrying out phishing scams won’t be able to trick you into entering your details into a copycat login page for your bank. And because passkeys use cryptographic security, they also can’t brute force their way into your account by trying passwords exposed in previous data breaches or guessing them.

Where can you use passkeys?

Some 20% of the world’s top 100 websites now accept passkeys, said Andrew Shikiar, CEO of the FIDO Alliance, an industry group that developed the core authentication technology behind passkeys.

Passkeys first came to the public’s attention when Apple added the technology to iOS in 2022. They got more traction after Google started using them in 2023. Now, many other companies including PayPal, Amazon, Microsoft and eBay work with passkeys. There’s a list on the FIDO Alliance website.

Still, some popular sites like Facebook and Netflix haven’t started using them yet.

Passkey technology is still in the “early adoption” phase but “it’s just a matter of time for more and more sites to start offering this,” Shikiar said.

How to set up a passkey

I tried setting up passkeys for some of the major online services I use. It was fairly easy for some but confusing for others. Shikiar said his group is constantly working on ways to improve the user experience.

Google users can go to myaccount.google.com and under “How to sign in to Google”, click Passkeys and security keys. Upon reaching the setup screen, I received a prompt to create a passkey while simultaneously my password manager’s browser plug-in popped up offering to save it. I clicked to confirm and the setup work was all done automatically.

So far, pretty easy.

Then, I tried adding more Google passkeys to my Windows-based work laptop and a Yubico physical security key. This time, when I got to the Google setup screen, it asked for my existing passkey to confirm my identity. But then it somehow failed to authenticate through my password manager.

I tried again using other verification methods, including my Google authenticator app that I already had on my iPhone, and it eventually succeeded.

Adding multiple passkeys to my Microsoft account — one on my password manager, another on my Yubico key — involved some head scratching over a few of the prompts, but I eventually figured it out.

Setting up passkeys on LinkedIn and Amazon was much easier. And when I attempted to add a passkey to my WhatsApp account, I discovered I had, apparently, already created one months earlier when I activated the app lock feature requiring a fingerprint scan.

Logging in

Once set up, it was a breeze to sign in to some of my accounts with just a click or two. But there was some friction with my PayPal account because its passkeys don’t work on some browsers, like Firefox.

When I tried to log in with my Amazon passkey, it asked for a one-time verification code from my authenticator app, which confused me because I thought passkeys were supposed to eliminate the need for multi-factor authentication.

Shikiar said it depends on the site, but, in theory, the passkey already has enough protection built in.

“When the primary factor’s un-phishable, other factors aren’t necessary,” he said.

What happens if I lose my passkey?

If you’ve lost the device containing your passkey, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s gone. That’s because the typical method to store passkeys on phones is a cloud-based password manager from Apple, Google, or third-party providers. So just log back into the password manager from another phone or computer.

Passkeys stored on security dongles, on the other hand, aren’t synced to the cloud so there’s no way to recover them if they’re lost. It’d be a good idea to get a second hardware key and keep it as a backup.

And don’t forget you can always mix both cloud and hardware methods to keep multiple passkeys for extra redundancy.

Should I add a passkeys to all my accounts?

Based on my experience, setting up a passkey can be easy, or tedious and bewildering, depending on the service and what other security technology you want to layer in.

So I wouldn’t recommend doing all your accounts right away.

Instead, choose a few of your most important and frequently used services or accounts and focus on a proper setup for those.

What about my passwords?

In theory, you could delete your old passwords. Some services like Microsoft already offer this option. Shikiar says it should be a “personal preference,” because “some people may feel extremely nervous” about going passwordless.

It’s fine to keep your password but make sure there’s also multi-factor authentication set up for it, he said.",Associated Press News,https://apnews.com/article/google-apple-passkey-password-cybersecurity-e058dbdd304ff90c9b49499cd121bb88,2024-11-14 09:00:06+00:00
Experts: Apple’s removal of news apps in Russia sets 'dangerous precedent',"Analysts warn that Apple’s removal of two apps from an independent media site from its Russian App Store sets a “dangerous precedent.”

The affected apps are for Current Time, a Russian-language network produced by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, or RFE/RL, in cooperation with VOA, and a Kyrgyz-language news app.

RFE/RL and VOA are independent media outlets funded by the U.S. Congress.

In a letter to RFE/RL, Apple said the action was in response to content that is deemed illegal in Russia. Apple added that in Russia, RFE/RL is labeled an “undesirable” organization.

RFE/RL President Stephen Capus said he is concerned about Apple’s compliance with Roskomnadzor, Russia’s media regulatory agency.

“We hope this decision — which is part of a trend to deny people in authoritarian countries access to uncensored information — will be reversed,” Capus said in a statement shared with VOA.

Digital rights experts condemned the move.

“These trends set a dangerous precedent in which tech companies could inadvertently aid state-sponsored information censorship,” Matt Mahmoudi of Amnesty Tech told VOA.

When tech companies comply with foreign government requests, it could be because they “place profit margins over their obligations under international law,” according to Mahmoudi. These bans violate the U.N. right to free expression, he said.

Apple did not immediately respond to VOA’s request for comment.

The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ, called on Apple to reinstate the apps.

Such bans “restrict access to vital information and embolden authoritarian regimes seeking to silence independent media in countries like Russia,” said CPJ’s Europe and Central Asia program coordinator, Gulnoza Said.

Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, analysts have documented how Moscow has used internet blocks along with laws around false information about the war and so-called “undesirable” organizations to block independent media.

Access to independent news is limited, with websites, including RFE/RL and VOA, blocked. In February, Russia also designated RFE/RL an “undesirable organization.” The designation means that an entity is seen as a threat to national security. These organizations and their audiences can face penalties as a result.

Separately, Russia experienced a mass YouTube outage in August. The platform is one of the few remaining sites where audiences can access independent information.

The country has long experienced slow playback speeds, making video-watching nearly impossible.

Russia at the time blamed YouTube’s parent company Google. But investigative reporters found Russia’s state regulator responsible. YouTube also rejected claims that it was responsible for the slowdown.

The Russian Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to VOA’s request for comment.

To circumvent censorship, audiences often rely on Virtual Private Networks, or VPNs, to access banned apps, according to Anastasia Zhyrmont of the digital civil rights group Access Now.

Last month, Apple was criticized after it banned 98 VPN services from its Russian App Store. The media regulator in July had publicly requested 25 be removed.

“The trend is very concerning,” Zhyrmont told VOA. “VPNs are essential for users in restrictive environments, especially in Russia.”

Some media sites that Russia has banned use technologies embedded in apps to circumvent the firewalls and bans. The news website Meduza, which is blocked inside Russia, uses data obfuscation technology to reach Russian audiences without a VPN, according to a representative from their tech team.

""It is cat-mice game — they're trying to block our tech, and we’re trying to come up with something new,"" the representative, who asked not to be named for security reasons, told VOA in an email.

Zhyrmont wants Apple to offer transparency on its decision to remove the news apps from the Russian market and on what Roskomnadzor’s requests looked like.

Until then, she said, “There’s an agreement between digital rights experts and human rights defenders that all that is happening is an act of censorship.”

Meta is hoping Apple's Vision Pro can help save the metaverse,"Meta is feeling good about Apple's entry into the virtual reality market.

Meta execs are feeling optimistic about the competition, The Wall Street Journal reported.

The company hopes its Quest headset will be the Android phone of the metaverse.

Meta is feeling good about Apple's entry into the VR arena.

The iPhone maker is preparing to launch its mixed-reality headset, the Vision Pro, later this week.

But, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal, Meta is optimistic about the competition.

Meta execs view Apple's entry into the market not just as a validation for Mark Zuckerberg's pivot to the metaverse, but also as a way to draw in more customers, the Journal reported, citing unnamed sources. They said the company hopes its Quest headset could become the Google Android of the metaverse.

Meta's headset is being sold for around $500, a fraction of the Vision Pro's $3,500 price tag. The latter device's hefty price tag, which has already proved to be a sore spot with potential buyers, may push customers towards Meta's cheaper alternatives.

The price for Apple's latest offering has raised eyebrows with those already using the metaverse. One Oculus user told the Financial Times he found the idea of paying $3,499 laughable.

It's not the first time Apple's new product has been linked to the rival tech company. Some commentators have theorized that Apple's headset is a form of insurance against Meta.

Bloomberg reported that Apple would face issues if augmented reality headsets took off and it did not have a product in the space. The Vision Pro is more of a defense against the potential popularity of this tech, he argued.

Zuckerberg's decision to go all-in on the metaverse failed to resonate with consumers and has cost the company billions.

A recent BI analysis of regulatory filings found that Meta has lost a cumulative $47 billion in its metaverse-focused Reality Labs division since 2019.

Still, Zuckerberg says he has no plans to give up on the dream.

He told The Verge: ""I don't know how to more unequivocally state that we're continuing to focus on Reality Labs and the metaverse.""

Meta company was still pouring more than $15 billion a year into the project, Zuckerberg added.

Representatives for Meta did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Christina Applegate: Multiple Sclerosis Leaves Her 'Screaming' in Pain,"“I lay in bed screaming — like, the sharp pains, the ache, that squeezing,” she says

In the three years since Christina Applegate was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, the actress’ medical condition has steadily progressed. During a recent episode of her podcast MeSsy — co-hosted with Jamie-Lynn Sigler, who also received a MS diagnosis — she detailed the chronic pain she faces and how it impacts her daily life.

“I lay in bed screaming — like, the sharp pains, the ache, that squeezing,” she explained. “I can’t even pick up my phone sometimes because now it’s traveled into my hands, so I’ll, like, try to go get my phone or get my remote to turn on the TV or sometimes, I can’t even hold them. I can’t open bottles now.”

Applegate referred to multiple sclerosis as being an “invisible disease,” which prompted agreement from their podcast guest Rory Kandel. Kandel is the founder of Rory’s Bakehouse and was diagnosed with MS in 2023. Describing her pain, the owner said: “It feels like I have knives in my stomach. I’ll be laying in bed, and I wake up, and I physically can’t turn from side to side.”

The pain is particularly intense in the morning, the hosts and guest shared. “I put my feet on the ground and they’re hurting, like, extraordinarily bad to the touch,” Applegate said. Spinning the unfortunate truth into a comedic moment, she joked: “I was like, yep. Gonna get back in my bed and pee in my diaper because I don’t feel like walking all the way to the damn bathroom … That’s just a joke. But it’s like it’s so freaking painful and so hard and so awkward.”

According to Johns Hopkins Medicine, multiple sclerosis is a chronic disease that impacts the nervous system. “It is thought to be an autoimmune disorder, a condition in which the body attacks itself by mistake,” a description of the condition reads. “MS is an unpredictable disease that affects people differently. Some people with MS may have only mild symptoms. Others may lose their ability to see clearly, write, speak, or walk when communication between the brain and other parts of the body becomes disrupted.”

The National Multiple Sclerosis Society estimates that nearly one million people in the U.S. are living with MS, according to a 2019 study by the organization.",Rolling Stone,https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/christina-applegate-multiple-sclerosis-pain-1235154856/,2024-11-06 16:43:49+00:00
"Trump, Stefanik campaign for vulnerable NY Republicans as Big Apple kicks off early voting","Former President Trump is campaigning for vulnerable House Republicans in New York Saturday evening alongside House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., a source familiar with the effort told Fox News Digital.

Saturday also marked the first day of early in-person voting in the Empire State.

A source told Fox News Digital early voting would be a central focus of the telephone rally, or ""tele-rally,"" with key Republicans including Trump urging as many as 1 million listeners not to wait until Election Day to cast ballots.

""New York is Trump country,"" Stefanik said. ""Hardworking New Yorkers support President Trump in record numbers. Far left New York Democrats like Kamala Harris and Kathy Hochul have failed our state, and their polling numbers are in free fall. I am incredibly grateful that President Trump continues to invest in our key battleground districts in New York.""

Stefanik and her team are dialing out to nearly 1 million Trump supporters in a bid to raise enthusiasm ahead of Nov. 5, the source familiar with planning said.

Other New York Republican lawmakers expected on the call include representatives Nick LaLota, Anthony D'Esposito, Mike Lawler, Marc Molinaro and Brandon Williams, the source said.

Republican candidates Mike LiPetri and Alison Esposito are also expected.

""The GOP momentum is palpable across the Empire State, and President Trump’s personal investment in the fight to flip New York red and win in battleground congressional districts like mine proves that New Yorkers will play a vital role in the Republican resurgence this year,"" D'Esposito told Fox News Digital.

The GOP won the House majority in 2022 in part because of a suburban rebellion in New York and California against the states' progressive crime policies.

Several of the lawmakers expected on the call are in districts President Biden won in 2020.

But the Saturday evening call is a sign of confidence for Republicans in the traditionally blue stronghold. Republicans hope discontent with the economy and the border will be enough to propel them to victory in dozens of tight races.

Esposito said Trump's support was ""crucial"" this year.

""Events like tonight’s tele-town hall are essential in connecting our candidates with voters and encouraging everyone to make their voices heard at the polls,"" she told Fox News Digital.

Stefanik, who is hosting the call, was the first member of the 118th Congress to endorse Trump for re-election.

It comes the day before Trump has a rally at Madison Square Garden featuring a litany of top figures in the GOP.

Members of House GOP leadership, including Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.; House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La.; and Stefanik are all expected to attend.",Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-stefanik-campaign-vulnerable-ny-republicans-big-apple-kicks-off-early-voting,2024-10-26 20:17:22-04:00
Apple and Google face UK investigation into mobile browser dominance,"LONDON (AP) — Apple and Google aren’t giving consumers a genuine choice of mobile web browsers, a British watchdog said Friday in a report that recommends they face an investigation under new U.K. digital rules taking effect next year.

The Competition and Markets Authority took aim at Apple, saying the iPhone maker’s tactics hold back innovation by stopping rivals from giving users new features like faster webpage loading. Apple does this by restricting progressive web apps, which don’t need to be downloaded from an app store and aren’t subject to app store commissions, the report said.

“This technology is not able to fully take off on iOS devices,” the watchdog said in a provisional report on its investigation into mobile browsers that it opened after an initial study concluded that Apple and Google effectively have a chokehold on “mobile ecosystems.”

The CMA’s report also found that Apple and Google manipulate the choices given to mobile phone users to make their own browsers “the clearest or easiest option.”

And it said that the a revenue-sharing deal between the two U.S. Big Tech companies “significantly reduces their financial incentives” to compete in mobile browsers on Apple’s iOS operating system for iPhones.

Both companies said they will “engage constructively” with the CMA.

Apple said it disagreed with the findings and said it was concerned that the recommendations would undermine user privacy and security.

Google said the openness of its Android mobile operating system “has helped to expand choice, reduce prices and democratize access to smartphones and apps” and that it’s “committed to open platforms that empower consumers.”

It’s the latest move by regulators on both sides of the Atlantic to crack down on the dominance of Big Tech companies. U.S. federal prosecutors this week unveiled their proposals to force Google to sell off its Chrome browser as they target its monopoly in online search.

The CMA’s final report is due by March. The watchdog indicated it would recommend using the U.K.'s new digital competition rulebook set to take effect next year, which includes new powers to rein in tech companies, to prioritize further investigation into Apple’s and Google’s “activities in mobile ecosystems.”",Associated Press News,https://apnews.com/article/apple-google-britain-mobile-browser-competition-antitrust-6e452617f4dcb48a76ebff8482d0d16e,2024-11-22 15:11:29+00:00
Chinese official urges Apple to continue 'deepening' presence in China,"A top Chinese official has urged tech giant Apple to deepen its presence and investment in innovation in the world’s second largest economy at a time when supply chains and companies are shifting production and operations away from China.

As U.S.-China geopolitical tensions simmer and tech competition between Beijing and Western countries intensifies, foreign investment in China shrunk in 2023 to its lowest level in three decades, according to government statistics.

The United States has banned the export of advanced technology to China and Beijing’s crackdown on spying in the name of national security concerns has spooked investors.

On Wednesday, Jin Zhuanglong - China's Minister for Industry and Information Technology – told Apple CEO Tim Cook he hoped that, “Apple will continue to deepen its presence in the Chinese market,"" urging Cook to “increase investment in innovation, grow alongside Chinese firms, and share in the dividends of high-quality investment,” according to a ministry statement.

At the meeting Jin also discussed “Apple's development in China, network data security management, (and) cloud services,"" according to the statement.

China has the world’s largest market for smartphones, and Apple is a leading competitor. However, increasingly the iPhone producer has lost market share in the country due to an increasing number of local rivals in the smartphone sector.

In the second quarter of this year, AFP reports that Apple ranked sixth among smartphone vendors in China, holding a 16% market share, marking a drop of three positions compared to its ranking during the same period last year, according to analysis firm Canalys.

Jin also repeated a frequent pledge from officials in Beijing that China would strive to provide a ""better environment"" for global investors and “continue to expand high-level opening up.

Cook’s trip to China was his second of the year. His posts on the X-like Chinese social media platform Weibo showed he visited an Apple store in downtown Beijing, visited an organic farm, and toured ancient neighborhoods with prominent artists such as local photographer Chen Man.

Cook added that he met with students from China’s Agricultural University and Zhejiang University to receive feedback on how iPhones and iPads can help farmers adopt more sustainable practices.

"Apple has already sold more than 200,000 Vision Pro headsets, report says","Apple has already sold around 200,000 Vision Pro headsets, MacRumors reported.

The headset sold out almost immediately after the preorders opened on January 19.

Apple's Vision Pro officially launches in the US on February 2.

Apple has sold around 200,000 Vision Pro headsets since preorders opened, MacRumors reported, citing a source familiar with the company's sales numbers.

The headset, which officially launches in the US this Friday, sold out quickly for early orders. It became available on 19 January at 8 a.m. ET, and within hours, the shipping times had slipped from February to March.

TF International Securities analyst Min-Chi Kuo, who specializes in Apple's supply chain, previously estimated the company sold somewhere between 160,000 to 180,000 Vision Pro headsets, based on preorder inventory and shipping time.

Kuo correctly predicted the headset would sell out soon after the release, citing a smaller shipment and the product's sky-high price tag. He later said that further scrutiny of the preorder shipping times, which had slipped initially but then held steady, suggested that demand for these devices had tailed off.

Kuo said the Vision Pro was still ""a very niche product"" for now and that demand for it would likely ""quickly taper off"" after die-hard fans had placed their orders.

Representatives for Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider, made outside normal working hours.

The Vision Pro is Apple's first new product category since it announced the Apple Watch in 2014.

The device is a mixed-reality headset that aims to merge the user's virtual experience with their real-world surroundings. Early reviews of the headset have been largely positive, although the $3,500 price tag has raised eyebrows.

Apple is set to embark on its biggest hardware launch in a decade with the Vision Pro. Stores have been prepping for the launch for months, with free demos on offer for those who want to try out the tech.

The Weeknd Teams Up With Apple Vision Pro on Immersive Music Video,"The Weeknd teamed up with Apple on 'Open Hearts,' a video experience exclusively available on the Apple Vision Pro, and fans can book a demo at their local Apple store

The Weeknd is known for creating immersive visuals, from his darkly cinematic music videos to his memorable Super Bowl performance. Now he’s getting even more immersive, teaming up with Apple on The Weeknd: Open Hearts, an immersive video experience available exclusively on the Apple Vision Pro. Open Hearts became available on Nov. 14 through the Apple TV app on the Apple Vision Pro. As of today, fans can book a demo at their local Apple Store to experience Open Hearts.

The Apple Vision Pro is available directly from Apple for between $3,499 for the 256 GB version to $3,899 for the 1 TB model.

The video takes listeners through a “haunted cityscape” that was “heavily inspired by Los Angeles’s iconic downtown skyline,” according to Apple. The video was directed by Anton Tammi. Tor Myhren, Apple’s vice president of Marketing Communications, said “With Vision Pro, fans experience storytelling in ways that were not possible before: with immersive visuals and Spatial Audio that make them feel like they’re right in the middle of the action.”

When the Apple Vision Pro was first announced last year, Apple highlighted its capabilities as a spatial computer, showing off the device’s capabilities for work, browsing, and video. Unlike the Meta Quest, formerly known as the Oculus Quest, the Apple Vision Pro is not primarily designed for gaming. Given the Apple Vision Pro’s much steeper price and disparity in gaming content, it’s unsurprising that Apple has been building up exclusive content to entice shoppers.

In addition to The Weeknd’s Open Hearts, Apple debuted Submerged, the first scripted short film shot for the Apple Vision Pro. The company will be rolling out other immersive video content like Concert for One, with the first performance from RAYE and a 20-piece band launching on Nov. 22.

Apple and Google could face a competition probe over their huge mobile ecosystems in the UK,"LONDON — Apple and Google could face a competition investigation into their dominance of mobile web browsers and apps in the U.K.

The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority issued a report Friday with a provisional decision from an independent inquiry group tasked by the regulator with carrying out an in-depth review of the mobile browser markets.

In the report, the group recommended that the CMA investigates Apple and Google's activities in mobile ecosystems under the new Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act (DMCC), a new U.K. law coming into force next year which seeks to prevent anti-competitive behavior in digital markets.

The DMCC is akin to the Digital Markets Act in the European Union. It gives the CMA the ability to designate firms as having ""Strategic Market Status"" (SMS) — which means they have a significant amount of market power in a certain digital business.

Under the rules, the CMA can impose major behavioral changes on firms that have SMS status, including ending ""self-preferencing"" of their own services, requiring interoperability — essentially allowing one piece of software to work with another smoothly — and banning anti-competitive behavior.

The CMA is required to undertake a formal investigation to give a firm SMS status.

For Apple specifically, the CMA inquiry group said it was concerned the tech giant's App Store rules ""restrict other competitors from being able to deliver new, innovative features that could benefit consumers"" — for example, faster webpage loading on iPhone apps.

It added many smaller U.K. developers said they would like to use ""progressive"" web apps — which allow firms to offer apps outside of an app store — but that this technology ""is not able to fully take off on iOS devices.""

The group also said it found a revenue-sharing agreement between Google and Apple to make Google the default search engine on iPhone ""significantly reduces their financial incentives to compete in mobile browsers on iOS.""

""Markets work best when rival businesses are able to develop and bring innovative options to consumers,"" Margot Daly, chair of the CMA's independent inquiry group, said in a statement, adding that ""competition between different mobile browsers is not working well and this is holding back innovation in the U.K.""

Apple said in a statement that it disagreed with the findings of the report and that it was concerned market interventions imposed under the DMCC ""would undermine user privacy and hinder our ability to make the kind of technology that sets Apple apart.""

""Apple believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish. We face competition in every segment and jurisdiction where we operate, and our focus is always the trust of our users"" an Apple spokesperson told CNBC via email.

Google was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.

The CMA group had also looked into restrictions on the distribution of gaming services on Apple's mobile app distribution platform. However, it's now decided to drop this element of the investigation following a decision by the U.S. tech giant to allow cloud gaming services on App Store.

The regulator said interested parties have until Dec. 13 to share comments on its provisional findings. It expects to make a final decision in March 2025.",CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/22/apple-and-google-could-face-uk-competition-probe-over-app-store-rules.html,2024-11-22 13:05:18+00:00
Apple's quarterly iPhone sales rise 6% as AI helps end slump,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple snapped out of a recent iPhone sales slump during its summer quarter, an early sign that its recent efforts to revive demand for its marquee product with an infusion of artificial intelligence are paying off.

Sales of the iPhone totaled $46.22 billion for the July-September period, a 6% increase from the same time last year, according to Apple’s fiscal fourth-quarter report released Thursday. That improvement reversed two consecutive year-over-year declines in the iPhone’s quarterly sales.

The iPhone boost helped Apple deliver total quarterly revenue and profit that exceeded the analyst projections that sway investors, excluding a one-time charge of $10.2 billion to account for a recent European Union court decision that lumped the Cupertino, California, company with a huge bill for back taxes.

Apple earned $14.74 billion, or 97 cents per share, a 36% decrease from the same time last year. If not for the one-time tax hit, Apple said it would have earned $1.64 per share — topping the $1.60 per share predicted by analysts, according to FactSet Research. Revenue rose 6% from last year to $94.93 billion, about $400 million more than analysts forecast.

But investors evidently were hoping for an even better quarter and appeared disappointed by an Apple forecast that implied its revenue for the October-December quarter covering the holiday shopping season might not grow as robustly as analysts envisioned. Apple’s stock price shed about 2% in Thursday’s extended trading, leaving the shares hovering around $221 — well below their peak of about $237 reached in mid-October.

The latest quarterly results captured the first few days that consumers were able to buy a new iPhone 16 line-up that included four different models designed to handle a variety of AI wizardry that the company is marketing as “Apple Intelligence.” The branding is part of Apple’s effort to distinguish its approach to AI from rivals such as Samsung and Google that got a head start on bringing the technology to smartphones.

Even though the iPhone 16 was specifically built with AI in mind, the technology didn’t become available until Apple released a free software update earlier this week that activated its first batch of technological tricks, including a feature designed to make its virtual assistant Siri smarter, more versatile and more colorful. And those improvements are only available in the U.S. for now.

“This is just the beginning of what we believe generative AI can do,” Apple CEO Tim Cook told analysts during a Thursday conference call.

Cook said plans to expand the AI iPhone features into other countries in December, as well as roll out other software updates that will inject even more of the technology in the iPhone 16 and two high-end iPhone 15 models that are also equipped with the special computer chips needed for the slick new features. The December expansion will include an option to connect with OpenAI’s ChatGPT to take advantage of technology that Apple isn’t making on its own. More languages

Investors are betting that as Apple’s AI becomes more broadly available, it will prompt the hundreds of millions of consumers who are using older iPhones to upgrade to newer models in order to get their hands on the latest technology.

“We believe it’s a compelling upgrade reason,” Cook asserted. But Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro believes iPhone sales would already be accelerating at a faster pace if consumers were blown away by Apple’s AI technology, increasing the pressure on the company “to do an overall better job to impress the public.”",Associated Press News,https://apnews.com/article/apple-iphone-quarterly-results-artificial-intelligence-377452ea3345de2981ea75f62b7cc840,2024-10-31 20:59:09+00:00
"US writer Anne Applebaum calls for arms for Ukraine, accepts German peace prize ","The prominent American journalist and historian Anne Applebaum urged continued support for Ukraine as she accepted a prestigious German prize Sunday, arguing that pacifism in the face of aggression is often nothing more than appeasement.

Applebaum made her appeal to an audience in Frankfurt, where she was awarded the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade. She was joined by her husband, Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski, who like his wife is a strong voice on the international stage for supporting Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia's brutal invasion.

“If there is even a small chance that military defeat could help end this horrific cult of violence in Russia, just as military defeat once brought an end to the cult of violence in Germany, we should take it,” Applebaum said.

Many Germans have embraced an ethos of pacifism because of their nation's aggression under Adolf Hitler during World War II. And many have misgivings now about supplying weapons to Kyiv, fearing Russia and worried that it could cause the war to spread beyond Ukraine's borders to the rest of Europe.

“Some even call for peace by referring solemnly to the ‘lessons of German history,” Applebaum noted, according to a transcript of her speech published by the prize organization.

“As I am here today accepting a peace prize, this seems the right moment to point out that ‘I want peace’ is not always a moral argument,"" Applebaum said. “This is also the right moment to say that the lesson of German history is not that Germans should be pacifists.""

""On the contrary, we have known for nearly a century that a demand for pacifism in the face of an aggressive, advancing dictatorship can simply represent the appeasement and acceptance of that dictatorship.”

She argued that the “real lesson” from German history should be that Germans ""have a special responsibility to stand up for freedom and to take risks in doing so.”

The prize, which is endowed with $27,185, was awarded in St. Paul's Church in Frankfurt — which is considered the birthplace of German parliamentary democracy — at the end of the Frankfurt Book Fair.

The prize has been awarded since 1950. It honors individuals who have contributed to turning the idea of peace into reality through literature, science or art. Last year’s prize was awarded to British-Indian writer Salman Rushdie for his perseverance despite enduring decades of threats and violence.

The German news agency dpa reported that Applebaum's strong support for continuing to arm Ukraine triggered some criticism, citing Karin Schmidt-Friderichs, the head of the German Publishers and Booksellers Association, which awards the prize.

Nonetheless she received strong applause for her speech, dpa reported from Frankfurt.

Following pacifism to its logical conclusion, Applebaum argued, would ""mean that we should acquiesce to the military conquest of Ukraine, to the cultural destruction of Ukraine, to the construction of concentration camps in Ukraine, to the kidnapping of children in Ukraine.”

Applebaum writes for The Atlantic magazine. She has written books that focus on totalitarianism in Eastern Europe, including “The Gulag,"" and “The Iron Curtain” and “Red Famine,” about dictator Joseph Stalin's war on Ukraine. She recently published “Autocracy, Inc. The Dictators Who Want to Run the World.” In 2004, she was awarded the prestigious Pulitzer Prize.

The prize jury said Applebaum’s analyses of communist and post-communist systems in the Soviet Union and Russia reveal “the mechanisms by which authoritarians grab hold of power and maintain their control.”

The laudation for Applebaum was delivered by the Russian historian Irina Scherbakova, a founding member of the human rights organization Memorial, which is now banned in Russia and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022.",Voice Of America,https://www.voanews.com/a/us-writer-anne-applebaum-calls-for-arms-for-ukraine-accepts-german-peace-prize-/7829375.html,2024-10-20 16:41:34+00:00
How to check your heartbeat with ECG app on your Apple Watch,"Imagine having a mini heart monitor right on your wrist. The Apple Watch ECG app makes this possible, allowing you to take an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG or EKG, which represents the electrical pulses that make your heart beat.

This innovative feature can provide valuable insights and potentially alert you to irregularities.

The ECG app on Apple Watch Series 4 or later and all models of Apple Watch Ultra generates an ECG that is similar to a single-lead (or Lead I) ECG. Let’s dive into how to set up and use this amazing tool.

Before diving into this ECG app, it’s essential to ensure that your iPhone is updated to the latest operating system.

Before you can start monitoring your heart rhythm, you'll need to set up the ECG app. Here's how:

Once you've set up the app, taking an ECG is a straightforward process:

After the recording, you'll receive one of the following classifications:

Sinus rhythm: Your heart is beating in a uniform pattern.

Atrial fibrillation (AFib): Your heart shows signs of an irregular rhythm, which can be a serious condition.

Low or high heart rate: Your heart rate is below 50 BPM or above 120 BPM (or 150 BPM in ECG version 2).

Inconclusive: The app couldn't classify your heart rhythm.

To review your ECG history and add symptoms:

To share your ECG results with your health care provider:

The Apple Watch ECG app is a powerful tool for monitoring your heart health. It provides valuable insights and can potentially detect serious conditions like AFib. The ability to take an ECG anytime, anywhere and easily share the results with your health care provider is truly revolutionary. However, it's crucial to remember that while the ECG app is FDA-cleared, it's not a substitute for professional medical care. Always consult with your health care provider if you have any concerns about your heart health or if you receive any unusual results from your ECG readings.

The CEO behind a Chinese startup says its AR glasses will blow Apple's Vision Pro out of the water. Here's why. ,"Apple's Vision Pro headset is expected to revolutionize the market for mixed reality devices.

But the CEO of XReal thinks its AR glasses will be a strong rival to Apple's device.

The Chinese startup plans to offer a more affordable mixed-reality device.

Earlier this month, Chinese startup XReal unveiled the Air 2 Ultra, the company's latest augmented reality glasses that blend a virtual world with the user's physical surroundings.

Its hope? To give consumers a cheaper substitute to Apple's pricier Vision Pro devices.

Available for pre-order starting at $699, XReal's Air 2 Ultra are glasses that project a virtual screen that presents notifications and video onto the user's line of vision when worn.

The startup says they'll be an ""affordable alternative"" to rivals like the Apple Vision Pro.

The iPhone maker's mixed reality headset starts at a whopping $3,499.

""Unlike competing brands in this emerging space, we believe in making advanced wearable 6DoF glasses something you can wear all day long and that are accessible to all players in the XR development ecosystem,"" Chi Xu, the CEO of Xreal, said in its January press release.

XReal also said that the Air 2 Ultra will rival the Meta Quest 3, though those goggles appear to be cheaper starting at $499.

Xu didn't immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment before publication. Neither did Apple or Meta.

Xu told Bloomberg in a recent interview that the company's older, cheaper models of its AI glasses will be ""definitely easier to sell"" and are mostly purchased on Amazon.

Still, Xu expects the Air 2 Ultra — with 50,000 units expected to be produced this year — to be the company's real money maker in the future.

XReal, which has been selling AR glasses as part of its Air product line since 2017, is reportedly set to raise an additional $60 million from an undisclosed supply chain partner — putting the company one step closer to going toe-to-toe with tech giants Apple and Meta, the CEO says.

""This will help us scale our manufacturing capabilities and research and development,"" Xu told Bloomberg.

Thanks to its latest funding round, XReal predicts its production capacity will nearly double within the next two years.

This year, the startup is expected to produce an additional 500,000 to 1 million units of its AR devices, and projects to rake in $100 to $150 million in revenue, according to Bloomberg.

In 2025, the company expects to generate up to 2 million devices which is projected to translate to $200 to $300 million in revenue.

Unlike Apple's Vision Pro, Xu says XReal has no intentions to build a fully immersive virtual reality feature into its glasses. Yet, when it comes to its AR capabilities, Xu says his company's is half a decade ahead of Apple's.

After all, Xreal comprised nearly half of the market share for AR devices in the third quarter of last year, according to data from research firm IDC.

""I think we're three to five years ahead of them in AR,"" Chi said in regards to Apple. ""They are catching up, though. So we need to keep up and push the boundary.""

New Group Attacking iPhone Encryption Backed by U.S. Political Dark-Money Network,"The Heat Initiative, a nonprofit child safety advocacy group, was formed earlier this year to campaign against some of the strong privacy protections Apple provides customers. The group says these protections help enable child exploitation, objecting to the fact that pedophiles can encrypt their personal data just like everyone else.

When Apple launched its new iPhone this September, the Heat Initiative seized on the occasion, taking out a full-page New York Times ad, using digital billboard trucks, and even hiring a plane to fly over Apple headquarters with a banner message. The message on the banner appeared simple: “Dear Apple, Detect Child Sexual Abuse in iCloud” — Apple’s cloud storage system, which today employs a range of powerful encryption technologies aimed at preventing hackers, spies, and Tim Cook from knowing anything about your private files.

Something the Heat Initiative has not placed on giant airborne banners is who’s behind it: a controversial billionaire philanthropy network whose influence and tactics have drawn unfavorable comparisons to the right-wing Koch network. Though it does not publicize this fact, the Heat Initiative is a project of the Hopewell Fund, an organization that helps privately and often secretly direct the largesse — and political will — of billionaires. Hopewell is part of a giant, tightly connected web of largely anonymous, Democratic Party-aligned dark-money groups, in an ironic turn, campaigning to undermine the privacy of ordinary people.

For experts on transparency about money in politics, the Hopewell Fund’s place in the wider network of Democratic dark money raises questions that groups in the network are disinclined to answer.

“None of these groups are particularly open with me or other people who are tracking dark money about what it is they’re doing,” said Robert Maguire, of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW. Maguire said the way the network operated called to mind perhaps the most famous right-wing philanthropy and dark-money political network: the constellation of groups run and supported by the billionaire owners of Koch Industries. Of the Hopewell network, Maguire said, “They also take on some of the structural calling cards of the Koch network; it is a convoluted group, sometimes even intentionally so.”

The decadeslong political and technological campaign to diminish encryption for the sake of public safety — known as the “Crypto Wars” — has in recent years pivoted from stoking fears of terrorists chatting in secret to child predators evading police scrutiny. No matter the subject area, the battle is being waged between those who think privacy is an absolute right and those who believe it ought to be limited for expanded oversight from law enforcement and intelligence agencies. The ideological lines pit privacy advocates, computer scientists, and cryptographers against the FBI, the U.S. Congress, the European Union, and other governmental bodies around the world. Apple’s complex 2021 proposal to scan cloud-bound images before they ever left your phone became divisive even within the field of cryptography itself.

While the motives on both sides tend to be clear — there’s little mystery as to why the FBI doesn’t like encryption — the Heat Initiative, as opaque as it is new, introduces the obscured interests of billionaires to a dispute over the rights of ordinary individuals.

“I’m uncomfortable with anonymous rich people with unknown agendas pushing these massive invasions of our privacy,” Matthew Green, a cryptographer at Johns Hopkins University and a critic of the plan to have Apple scan private files on its devices, told The Intercept. “There are huge implications for national security as well as consumer privacy against corporations. Plenty of unsavory reasons for people to push this technology that have nothing to do with protecting children.”

Apple’s Aborted Scanning Scheme

Last month, Wired reported the previously unknown Heat Initiative was pressing Apple to reconsider its highly controversial 2021 proposal to have iPhones constantly scan their owners’ photos as they were uploaded to iCloud, checking to see if they were in possession of child sexual abuse material, known as CSAM. If a scan turned up CSAM, police would be alerted. While most large internet companies check files their users upload and share against a centralized database of known CSAM, Apple’s plan went a step further, proposing to check for illegal files not just on the company’s servers, but directly on its customers’ phones.

“In the hierarchy of human privacy, your private files and photos should be your most important confidential possessions,” Green said. “We even wrote this into the U.S. Constitution.”

The backlash was swift and effective. Computer scientists, cryptographers, digital rights advocates, and civil libertarians immediately protested, claiming the scanning would create a deeply dangerous precedent. The ability to scan users’ devices could open up iPhones around the world to snooping by authoritarian governments, hackers, corporations, and security agencies. A year later, Apple reversed course and said it was shelving the idea.

Green said that efforts to push Apple to monitor the private files of iPhone owners are part of a broader effort against encryption, whether used to safeguard your photographs or speak privately with others — rights that were taken for granted before the digital revolution. “We have to have some principles about what we’ll give up to fight even heinous crime,” he said. “And these proposals give up everything.”

In an unusual move justifying its position, Apple provided Wired with a copy of the letter it sent to the Heat Initiative in reply to its demands. “Scanning every user’s privately stored iCloud data would create new threat vectors for data thieves to find and exploit,” the letter read. “It would also inject the potential for a slippery slope of unintended consequences. Scanning for one type of content, for instance, opens the door for bulk surveillance and could create a desire to search other encrypted messaging systems across content types.”

The strong encryption built into iPhones, which shields sensitive data like your photos and iMessage conversations even from Apple itself, is frequently criticized by police agencies and national security hawks as providing shelter to dangerous criminals. In a 2014 speech, then-FBI Director James Comey singled out Apple’s encryption specifically, warning that “encryption threatens to lead all of us to a very dark place.”

Some cryptographers respond that it’s impossible to filter possible criminal use of encryption without defeating the whole point of encryption in the first place: keeping out prying eyes.

Similarly, any attempt to craft special access for police to use to view encrypted conversations when they claim they need to — a “backdoor” mechanism for law enforcement access — would be impossible to safeguard against abuse, a stance Apple now says it shares.

Dark-Money Network

For an organization demanding that Apple scour the private information of its customers, the Heat Initiative discloses extremely little about itself. According to a report in the New York Times, the Heat Initiative is armed with $2 million from donors including the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, an organization founded by British billionaire hedge fund manager and Google activist investor Chris Cohn, and the Oak Foundation, also founded by a British billionaire. The Oak Foundation previously provided $250,000 to a group attempting to weaken end-to-end encryption protections in EU legislation, according to a 2020 annual report.

In an interview, Gardner declined to name the Heat Initiative’s funders, but she said the group hadn’t received any money from governmental or law enforcement organizations. “My goal is for child sexual abuse images to not be freely shared on the internet, and I’m here to advocate for the children who cannot make the case for themselves,” Gardner added.

She said she disagreed with “privacy absolutists” — a group now apparently including Apple — who say CSAM-scanning iPhones would have imperiled user safety. “I think data privacy is vital,” she said. “I think there’s a conflation between user privacy and known illegal content.”

Heat Initiative spokesperson Kevin Liao told The Intercept that, while the group does want Apple to re-implement its 2021 plan, it would be open to other approaches to screening everyone’s iCloud storage for CSAM. Since Apple began allowing iCloud users to protect their photos with end-to-end encryption last December, however, this objective is far trickier now than it was back in 2021; to scan iCloud images today would still require the mass-scrutinizing of personal data in some manner. As Apple put it in its response letter, “Scanning every user’s privately stored iCloud content would in our estimation pose serious unintended consequences for our users.”

Both the Oak Foundation and Thorn were cited in a recent report revealing the extent to which law enforcement and private corporate interests have influenced European efforts to weaken encryption in the name of child safety.

Beyond those groups and a handful of names, however, there is vanishingly little information available about what the Heat Initiative is, where it came from, or who exactly is paying its bills and why. Its website, which describes the group only as a “collective effort of concerned child safety experts and advocates” — who go unnamed — contains no information about funding, staff, or leadership.

One crucial detail, however, can be found buried in the “terms of use” section of the Heat Initiative’s website: “THIS WEBSITE IS OWNED AND OPERATED BY Hopewell Fund AND ITS AFFILIATES.” Other than a similarly brief citation in the site’s privacy policy, there is no other mention of the Hopewell Fund or explanation of its role. The omission is significant, given Hopewell’s widely reported role as part of a shadowy cluster of Democratic dark-money groups that funnel billions from anonymous sources into American politics.

Hopewell is part of a labyrinthine billionaire-backed network that receives and distributes philanthropic cash while largely obscuring its origin. The groups in this network include New Venture Fund (which has previously paid salaries at Hopewell), the Sixteen Thirty Fund, and Arabella Advisors, a for-profit company that helps administer these and other Democratic-leaning nonprofits and philanthropies. The groups have poured money into a wide variety of causes ranging from abortion access to opposing Republican tax policy, along the way spending big on elections — about $1.2 billion total in 2020 alone, according to a New York Times investigation.

The deep pockets of this network and mystery surrounding the ultimate source of its donations have drawn comparisons — by Maguire, the Times, and others — to the Koch brothers’ network, whose influence over electoral politics from the right long outraged Democrats. When asked by The Atlantic in 2021 whether she felt good “that you’re the left’s equivalent of the Koch brothers,” Sampriti Ganguli, at the time the CEO of Arabella Advisors, replied in the affirmative.

“Sixteen Thirty Fund is the largest network of liberal politically active nonprofits in the country,” Maguire of CREW told The Intercept. “We’re talking here about hundreds of millions of dollars.”

Liao told The Intercept that Hopewell serves as the organization’s “fiscal sponsor,” an arrangement that allows tax-deductible donations to pass through a registered nonprofit on its way to an organization without tax-exempt status. Liao declined to provide a list of the Heat Initiative’s funders beyond the two mentioned by the New York Times. Owing to this fiscal sponsorship, Liao continued, “the Hopewell Fund’s board is Heat Initiative’s board.” Hopewell’s board includes New Venture Fund President Lee Bodner and Michael Slaby, a veteran of Barack Obama’s 2008 and 2012 campaigns and former chief technology strategist at an investment fund operated by ex-Google chair Eric Schmidt.

When asked who exactly was leading the Heat Initiative, Liao told The Intercept that “it’s just the CEO Sarah Gardner.” According to LinkedIn, however, Lily Rhodes, also previously with Thorn, now works as Heat Initiative’s director of strategic operations. Liao later said Rhodes and Gardner are the Heat Initiative’s only two employees. When asked to name the “concerned child safety experts and advocates” referred to on the Heat Initiative’s website, Liao declined.

“When you take on a big corporation like Apple,” he said, “you probably don’t want your name out front.”

Hopewell’s Hopes

Given the stakes — nothing less than the question of whether people have an absolute right to communicate in private — the murkiness surrounding a monied pressure campaign against Apple is likely to concern privacy advocates. The Heat Initiative’s efforts also give heart to those aligned with law enforcement interests. Following the campaign’s debut, former Georgia Bureau of Investigations Special Agent in Charge Debbie Garner, who has also previously worked for iPhone-hacking tech firm Grayshift, hailed the Heat Initiative’s launch in a LinkedIn group for Homeland Security alumni, encouraging them to learn more.

The larger Hopewell network’s efforts to influence political discourse have attracted criticism and controversy in the past. In 2021, OpenSecrets, a group that tracks money in politics, reported that New Venture Fund and the Sixteen Thirty Fund were behind a nationwide Facebook ad campaign pushing political messaging from Courier News, a network of websites designed to look like legitimate, independent political news outlets.

Despite its work with ostensibly progressive causes, Hopewell has taken on conservative campaigns: In 2017, Deadspin reported with bemusement an NFL proposal in which the league would donate money into a pool administered by the Hopewell Fund as part of an incentive to get players to stop protesting the national anthem.

Past campaigns connected to Hopewell and its close affiliates have been suffused with Big Tech money. Hopewell is also the fiscal sponsor of the Economic Security Project, an organization that promotes universal basic income founded by Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes. In 2016, SiliconBeat reported that New Venture Fund, which is bankrolled in part by major donations from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, was behind the Google Transparency Project, an organization that publishes unflattering research relating to Google. Arabella has also helped Microsoft channel money to its causes of choice, the report noted. Billionaire eBay founder Pierre Omidyar has also provided large cash gifts to both Hopewell and New Venture Fund, according to the New York Times (Omidyar is a major funder of The Intercept).

According to Riana Pfefferkorn, a research scholar at Stanford University’s Internet Observatory program, the existence of the Heat Initiative is ultimately the result of an “unforced error” by Apple in 2021, when it announced it was exploring using CSAM scanning for its cloud service.

“And now they’re seeing that they can’t put the genie back in the bottle,” Pfefferkorn said. “Whatever measures they take to combat the cloud storage of CSAM, child safety orgs — and repressive governments — will remember that they’d built a tool that snoops on the user at the device level, and they’ll never be satisfied with anything less.”",The Intercept,https://theintercept.com/2023/10/01/apple-encryption-iphone-heat-initiative/,2023-10-01 10:00:00+00:00

One Tech Tip: How to prepare your online accounts for when you die,"LONDON (AP) — Most people have accumulated a pile of data — selfies, emails, videos and more — on their social media and digital accounts over their lifetimes. What happens to it when we die?

It’s wise to draft a will spelling out who inherits your physical assets after you’re gone, but don’t forget to take care of your digital estate too. Friends and family might treasure files and posts you’ve left behind, but they could get lost in digital purgatory after you pass away unless you take some simple steps.

Here’s how you can prepare your digital life for your survivors:

Apple

The iPhone maker lets you nominate a “ legacy contact ” who can access your Apple account’s data after you die. The company says it’s a secure way to give trusted people access to photos, files and messages. To set it up you’ll need an Apple device with a fairly recent operating system — iPhones and iPads need iOS or iPadOS 15.2 and MacBooks needs macOS Monterey 12.1.

For iPhones, go to settings, tap Sign-in & Security and then Legacy Contact. You can name one or more people, and they don’t need an Apple ID or device.

You’ll have to share an access key with your contact. It can be a digital version sent electronically, or you can print a copy or save it as a screenshot or PDF.

Take note that there are some types of files you won’t be able to pass on — including digital rights-protected music, movies and passwords stored in Apple’s password manager. Legacy contacts can only access a deceased user’s account for three years before Apple deletes the account.

Google

Google takes a different approach with its Inactive Account Manager, which allows you to share your data with someone if it notices that you’ve stopped using your account.

When setting it up, you need to decide how long Google should wait — from three to 18 months — before considering your account inactive. Once that time is up, Google can notify up to 10 people.

You can write a message informing them you’ve stopped using the account, and, optionally, include a link to download your data. You can choose what types of data they can access — including emails, photos, calendar entries and YouTube videos.

There’s also an option to automatically delete your account after three months of inactivity, so your contacts will have to download any data before that deadline.

Facebook and Instagram

Some social media platforms can preserve accounts for people who have died so that friends and family can honor their memories.

When users of Facebook or Instagram die, parent company Meta says it can memorialize the account if it gets a “valid request” from a friend or family member. Requests can be submitted through an online form.

The social media company strongly recommends Facebook users add a legacy contact to look after their memorial accounts. Legacy contacts can do things like respond to new friend requests and update pinned posts, but they can’t read private messages or remove or alter previous posts. You can only choose one person, who also has to have a Facebook account.

You can also ask Facebook or Instagram to delete a deceased user’s account if you’re a close family member or an executor. You’ll need to send in documents like a death certificate.

TikTok

The video-sharing platform says that if a user has died, people can submit a request to memorialize the account through the settings menu. Go to the Report a Problem section, then Account and profile, then Manage account, where you can report a deceased user.

Once an account has been memorialized, it will be labeled “Remembering.” No one will be able to log into the account, which prevents anyone from editing the profile or using the account to post new content or send messages.

X

It’s not possible to nominate a legacy contact on Elon Musk’s social media site. But family members or an authorized person can submit a request to deactivate a deceased user’s account.

Passwords

Besides the major online services, you’ll probably have dozens if not hundreds of other digital accounts that your survivors might need to access. You could just write all your login credentials down in a notebook and put it somewhere safe. But making a physical copy presents its own vulnerabilities. What if you lose track of it? What if someone finds it?

Instead, consider a password manager that has an emergency access feature. Password managers are digital vaults that you can use to store all your credentials. Some, like Keeper,Bitwarden and NordPass, allow users to nominate one or more trusted contacts who can access their keys in case of an emergency such as a death.

But there are a few catches: Those contacts also need to use the same password manager and you might have to pay for the service.",Associated Press News,https://apnews.com/article/apple-google-instagram-facebook-tiktok-03f23c18e54e2d81edc66c3adf6e3838,2024-10-24 07:00:06+00:00
Florida communities hit by 3 hurricanes grapple with whether to rebuild ,"It was just a month ago that Brooke Hiers left the state-issued emergency trailer where her family had lived since Hurricane Idalia slammed into her Gulf Coast fishing village of Horseshoe Beach in August 2023.

Hiers and her husband, Clint, were still finishing the electrical work in the home they painstakingly rebuilt themselves, wiping out Clint's savings to do so. They will never finish that wiring job.

Hurricane Helene blew their newly renovated home off its 4-foot-high pilings, sending it floating into the neighbor's yard next door.

""You always think, 'Oh, there's no way it can happen again,'"" Hiers said. ""I don't know if anybody's ever experienced this in the history of hurricanes.""

For the third time in 13 months, this windswept stretch of Florida's Big Bend took a direct hit from a hurricane — a one-two-three punch to an 80-kilometer (50-mile) sliver of the state's more than 13,500 kilometers (8,400 miles) of coastline, first by Idalia, then Hurricane Debby in August 2024 and now Helene.

Hiers, who sits on Horseshoe Beach's town council, said words like ""unbelievable"" are beginning to lose their meaning.

""I've tried to use them all. Catastrophic. Devastating. Heartbreaking … none of that explains what happened here,"" Hiers said.

The back-to-back hits to Florida's Big Bend are forcing residents to reckon with the true costs of living in an area under siege by storms that researchers say are becoming stronger because of climate change.

The Hiers, like many others here, can't afford homeowners insurance on their flood-prone houses, even if it were available. Residents who have watched their life savings get washed away multiple times are left with few choices — leave the communities where their families have lived for generations, pay tens of thousands of dollars to rebuild their houses on stilts as building codes require, or move into a recreational vehicle they can drive out of harm's way.

That's if they can afford any of those things. The storm left many residents bunking with family or friends, sleeping in their cars or sheltering in what's left of their collapsing homes.

Janalea England wasn't waiting for outside organizations to get aid to her friends and neighbors, turning her commercial fish market in the river town of Steinhatchee into a pop-up donation distribution center, just like she did after Hurricane Idalia. A row of folding tables was stacked with water, canned food, diapers, soap, clothes and shoes, a steady stream of residents coming and going.

""I've never seen so many people homeless as what I have right now. Not in my community,"" England said. ""They have nowhere to go.""

The sparsely populated Big Bend is known for its towering pine forests and pristine salt marshes that disappear into the horizon, a remote stretch of largely undeveloped coastline that's mostly dodged the crush of condos, golf courses and souvenir strip malls that has carved up so much of the Sunshine State.

This is a place where teachers, mill workers and housekeepers could still afford to live within walking distance of the Gulf's white sand beaches. Or at least they used to, until a third successive hurricane blew their homes apart.

Helene was so destructive, many residents don't have a home left to clean up, escaping the storm with little more than the clothes on their backs, even losing their shoes to the surging tides.

With marinas washed away, restaurants collapsed, and vacation homes blown apart, many commercial fishermen, servers and house cleaners lost their homes and their jobs on the same day.

Those who worked at the local sawmill and paper mill, two bedrock employers in the area, were laid off in the past year too. Now a convoy of semi-trucks full of hurricane relief supplies have set up camp at the shuttered mill in the city of Perry.

Hud Lilliott was a mill worker for 28 years, before losing his job and now his canal-front home in Dekle Beach, just down the street from the house where he grew up.

Lilliott and his wife, Laurie, hope to rebuild their house there, but they don't know how they'll pay for it. And they're worried the school in Steinhatchee where Laurie teaches first grade could become another casualty of the storm, as the county watches its tax base float away.

""We've worked our whole lives, and we're so close to where they say the 'golden years,'"" Laurie said. ""It's like you can see the light and it all goes dark.""

Dave Beamer rebuilt his home in Steinhatchee after it was ""totaled"" by Hurricane Idalia, only to see it washed into the marsh a year later.

""I don't think I can do that again,"" Beamer said. ""Everybody's changing their mind about how we're going to live here.""

Beamer plans to stay in this river town but will put his home on wheels. He says he’ll buy a camper and build a pole barn to park it under.

In Horseshoe Beach, Hiers is waiting for a makeshift town hall to be delivered in the coming days, a double-wide trailer where they'll offer what services they can for as long as they can. She and her husband are staying with their daughter, a 45-minute drive away.

""You feel like this could be the end of things as you knew it. Of your town. Of your community,"" Hiers said. ""We just don't even know how to recover at this point.""",Voice Of America,https://www.voanews.com/a/florida-communities-hit-by-3-hurricanes-grapple-with-whether-to-rebuild-/7809628.html,2024-10-03 21:07:46+00:00
"Apple Watch Series 9 vs. Series 8: The Series 9's Double Tap Gesture and fast, new chip give it the edge over its predecessor","When the Apple Watch Series 9 was released in September 2023, it immediately supplanted the Series 8 in Apple's lineup as the company's flagship. It didn't usher in many significant new upgrades but the Series 9 is still the best Apple Watch you can buy, especially for new Watch wearers and those with older models.

But that's not to say the Series 8 is past its prime. For certain users, the Series 8 is still a highly useful wearable, especially if it can be purchased at a discount on its original price of $399. Current users don't necessarily need to rush out and upgrade to the Series 9 and can instead wait for the Series 10 (or whatever gets announced next year).

Below is an in-depth breakdown of the Apple Watch Series 9 and Series 8, with comparisons of the watches' design, smartwatch capability, health and fitness tracking, and battery life. Read our full review of the Apple Watch Series 8 and full review of the Apple Watch Series 9 for added insight.

Apple Watch Series 9 vs. Series 8: Specs

Apple Watch Series 9 vs. Series 8: Size and design

Both the Series 9 and Series 8 are identical in size and appearance. However, the biggest distinguishable difference between the two is that the Series 9 is available in a new pink colorway.

Each comes in two different display sizes, 41mm and 45mm, and both feature an always-on display, as well as two case options of either aluminum or stainless steel. Both watches are also compatible with a variety of the best Apple Watch bands and the best Apple Watch Series 9 bands.

For the Series 9, its finish options include pink, Midnight black, Starlight tan, silver, and red in the aluminum case, and gold, silver, and Graphite black in the stainless steel case. The Series 8 comes in Midnight black, Starlight tan, silver, and red with its aluminum case, and Graphite black, silver, and gold with the stainless steel case.

Internally, the Series 9 has Apple's fast, new S9 chip, while the Series 8 uses the S8 chip.

Apple Watch Series 9 vs. Series 8: Smartwatch features

The Series 9 and Series 8 are identical in how they function as a smartwatch. Although Apple released the updated Watch OS 10 operating system alongside the Series 9, it's also compatible with the Series 8.

The new features native to Watch OS 10 that work on both watches include updated app designs that make better use of the watch's screen area, a new Smart Stack display setting, the ability to activate the Control Center by pushing the watch's side button, and new watch faces. It also offers other features like new cycling metrics, updated hiking data, and new mental health insights.

While both watches can use Watch OS 10's new features, there is one new functionality native to only the Series 9: the Double Tap Gesture. The Double Tap Gesture allows users to interact with the Series 9 by double tapping their thumb and index finger. This gesture can answer or hang up phone calls, start or stop timers, and even take a photo as it's able to control the main button in any app.

The Series 9 also offers smoother navigation and improved effects thanks to its S9 chip. Its new ultra-wideband chip improves location accuracy for features like Find My iPhone, as well.

Other smartwatch utilities, like sending and receiving text messages, interacting with apps, and taking phone calls, function the same on both the Series 9 and Series 8. The Series 9 does have faster on-device Siri access, whereas the Series 8 utilizes Siri by communicating with the cloud.

Apple Watch Series 9 vs. Series 8: Health and fitness tracking

The Series 9 and Series 8 both have identical health and fitness tracking tools and function similarly when doing things like tracking activities, logging an ECG reading, or monitoring sleep. Since both watches are compatible with Watch OS 10, all new health and fitness features, such as the new cycling metrics and hiking stats, will work the same on either model.

However, the Series 9's Double Tap Gesture affects how users can use the health and fitness tools. For instance, since it's programmed to control a certain app's primary button, it can be used to start or stop a workout. This adds a degree of accessibility the Series 8 doesn't have.

Beyond that gesture control, though, the Series 9 and Series 8 function the same regarding their health and fitness capability.

It's worth noting that newer versions of the Series 9 no longer offer a blood oxygen-sensing feature. While the initial release of the watch did have it, an International Trade Commission patent ruling against Apple forced the company to remove access to the technology from its current watches (this also includes the Ultra 2). The ruling does not impact the Series 8 or any Series 9 sold before the decision.

Apple Watch Series 9 vs. Series 8: Battery life

Battery life is yet another area where the Series 9 and Series 8 are alike. Both deliver up to 18 hours of battery life on a full charge, with up to 36 hours of battery life in low-power mode. Low power mode shuts off some sensors while also disabling background apps to help the watch last longer.

The Series 9 and Series 8 are compatible with the same chargers, though the Series 9 does come with Apple's new USB-C charge cable. The Series 8 can also use this charger, though any new purchase of the watch comes with the standard lightning cable.

Apple Watch Series 9 vs. Series 8: Price

The Apple Watch Series 9 is available for purchase starting at $399 for the aluminum body model and $699 for the stainless steel option.

Conversely, the Series 8, which isn't sold by Apple anymore, can be found via a retailer like Amazon or Target for anywhere from $300 to $350. However, these prices will likely drop now that the Series 9 has been released.

Which should you buy?

The Apple Watch Series 9 and Series 8 are nearly identical smartwatches, with the Series 9's upgraded S9 chip and the new Double Tap Gesture being the most substantial differences. But by and large, they function the same.

Because of that, upgrading to the Series 9 is only for a select set of users. That is, anyone wearing a Series 5 or 6, or older, should seriously consider the Series 9, while those wearing last year's Series 8 (or the Series 7) can wait until next year. Even 2nd Generation SE users can hold off on upgrading.

But if the new features entice you enough to buy a Series 9, you won't be disappointed. It's an improvement over the Series 8, even if it is minimal, and it's not only the best Apple Watch but the best smartwatch you can buy, too.",Business Insider,https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/apple-watch-series-9-vs-series-8,2024-01-29 19:22:31+00:00
Indonesia wants Apple to sweeten its $100 million proposal as tech giant lobbies for iPhone 16 sales,"The Indonesian government expects Apple to increase its proposed $100 million investment into the country, according to state media, as the iPhone maker seeks clearance from Jakarta to sell its latest phones.

The American tech giant's latest smartphone model doesn't meet Indonesia's 40% domestic content requirements for smartphones and tablets and hasn't been granted clearance to be sold in the country.

The purpose of the ban is to protect local industry and jobs, with officials asking Apple to increase its investments and commitments to the economy in order to gain greater access.

According to a report from Indonesian state media, the country's Ministry of Industry met with representatives from Apple on Thursday regarding its proposal to invest $100 million over two years.

The funds would go toward a research and development center program and professional development academy in the country, as per the report.

The company also plans to produce accessory product components, specifically mesh for Apple's AirPods Max, starting in July 2025, it added.

Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC.

While the new offer is 10 times larger than a proposal that was reported earlier, the government is still striving to sweeten the deal to get a ""fair"" commitment.

""From the government's perspective, of course, we want this investment to be larger,"" industry ministry spokesperson Febri Hendri Antoni Arif told state media on Thursday.

He said that a larger investment would help the development of Indonesia's manufacturing sector, adding that its domestic industry was capable of supporting production of Apple devices such as chargers and accessories.

While Indonesia represents a small market for Apple, it also offers growth opportunities as it has the world's fourth-largest population, according to Le Xuan Chiew, a Canalys analyst focusing on Apple strategy research.

""Its young, tech-savvy population with growing digital literacy aligns with Apple's strategy to expand [global sales],"" he said, noting that it also offers potential for manufacturing and assembly that supports Apple's efforts to diversify its supply chain.

Success in this market requires a long-term approach, and Apple's investment offer demonstrates a commitment to complying with local regulations and paving the way for future growth, he added.",CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/22/indonesia-wants-apple-to-sweeten-its-100-million-proposal-as-tech-giant-lobbies-for-iphone-16-sales.html,2024-11-22 06:31:18+00:00
Apple Logs Your iMessage Contacts — and May Share Them With Police,"Apple promises that your iMessage conversations are safe and out of reach from anyone other than you and your friends. But according to a document obtained by The Intercept, your blue-bubbled texts do leave behind a log of which phone numbers you are poised to contact and shares this (and other potentially sensitive metadata) with law enforcement when compelled by court order.

Every time you type a number into your iPhone for a text conversation, the Messages app contacts Apple servers to determine whether to route a given message over the ubiquitous SMS system, represented in the app by those déclassé green text bubbles, or over Apple’s proprietary and more secure messaging network, represented by pleasant blue bubbles, according to the document. Apple records each query in which your phone calls home to see who’s in the iMessage system and who’s not.

This log also includes the date and time when you entered a number, along with your IP address — which could, contrary to a 2013 Apple claim that “we do not store data related to customers’ location,” identify a customer’s location. Apple is compelled to turn over such information via court orders for systems known as “pen registers” or “trap and trace devices,” orders that are not particularly onerous to obtain, requiring only that government lawyers represent they are “likely” to obtain information whose “use is relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation.” Apple confirmed to The Intercept that it only retains these logs for a period of 30 days, though court orders of this kind can typically be extended in additional 30-day periods, meaning a series of monthlong log snapshots from Apple could be strung together by police to create a longer list of whose numbers someone has been entering.

The Intercept received the document about Apple’s Messages logs as part of a larger cache originating from within the Florida Department of Law Enforcement’s Electronic Surveillance Support Team, a state police agency that facilitates police data collection using controversial tools like the Stingray, along with conventional techniques like pen registers. The document, titled “iMessage FAQ for Law Enforcement,” is designated for “Law Enforcement Sources” and “For Official Use Only,” though it’s unclear who wrote it or for what specific audience — metadata embedded in the PDF cites an author only named “mrrodriguez.” (The term “iMessages” refers to an old name for the Messages app still commonly used to refer to it.)

Phone companies routinely hand over metadata about calls to law enforcement in response to pen register warrants. But it’s noteworthy that Apple is able to provide information on iMessage contacts under such warrants given that Apple and others have positioned the messaging platform as a particularly secure alternative to regular texting.

The document reads like a fairly standard overview that one might forward to a clueless parent (questions include “How does it work?” and “Does iMessage use my cellular data plan?”), until the final section, “What will I get if I serve Apple with a [pen register/trap and trace] court order for an iMessage account?”:

This is a lot of bullet points to say one thing: Apple maintains a log of phone numbers you’ve entered into Messages and potentially elsewhere on an Apple device, like the Contacts app, even if you never end up communicating with those people. The document implies that Messages transmits these numbers to Apple when you open a new chat window and select a contact or number with whom to communicate, but it’s unclear exactly when these queries are triggered, and how often — an Apple spokesperson confirmed only that the logging information in the iMessage FAQ is “generally accurate,” but declined to elaborate on the record.

Illustration: Selman Design for The InterceptApple provided the following statement:

When law enforcement presents us with a valid subpoena or court order, we provide the requested information if it is in our possession. Because iMessage is encrypted end-to-end, we do not have access to the contents of those communications. In some cases, we are able to provide data from server logs that are generated from customers accessing certain apps on their devices. We work closely with law enforcement to help them understand what we can provide and make clear these query logs don’t contain the contents of conversations or prove that any communication actually took place.

And it’s true, based on the sample information provided in the FAQ, that Apple doesn’t appear to provide any indication whatsoever that an iMessage conversation took place. But a list of the people you choose to associate with can be just as sensitive as your messages with those people. It requires little stretching of the imagination to come up with a scenario in which the fact that you swapped numbers with someone at some point in the past could be construed as incriminating or compromising.

Andrew Crocker, an attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the document prompted further questions:

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement did not return a request for comment.

The fact that Apple is able and willing to help the government map the communications networks of its users doesn’t necessarily undermine the company’s posturing (and record) as a guardian of privacy, though this leaked document provides more detail about how the iMessages system can be monitored than has been volunteered in the past. Ideally, customers wouldn’t need to read documents marked “For Official Use Only” in order to know what information Apple may or may not disclose to the police. In a section of its website devoted to touting the privacy safeguards in its products, Apple claims that “your iMessages and FaceTime calls are your business, not ours. … Unlike other companies’ messaging services, Apple doesn’t scan your communications, and we wouldn’t be able to comply with a wiretap order even if we wanted to.”

In 2013, after Apple was revealed to be among the tech companies caught up in an NSA surveillance program known as PRISM, which tapped into customer information on the central servers of nine leading internet companies, the company released a rare statement regarding its “commitment to customer privacy,” insisting that it would be unable to share sensitive customer data even if it wanted to:

For example, conversations which take place over iMessage and FaceTime are protected by end-to-end encryption so no one but the sender and receiver can see or read them. Apple cannot decrypt that data. Similarly, we do not store data related to customers’ location, Map searches or Siri requests in any identifiable form.

Questions of how much Apple could or would aid police if asked vaulted back into headlines following the mass shooting in San Bernardino last year, which left the FBI in possession of the shooter’s iPhone, which it was unable initially to decrypt. Apple balked at demands that it help crack the phone, allowing it to enjoy a reputation as not just a maker of expensive electronics, but a determined privacy advocate. We need more technology companies that are willing to take public, principled stands in defense of our private lives, but these same companies should follow through with technical transparency, not just statements.",The Intercept,https://theintercept.com/2016/09/28/apple-logs-your-imessage-contacts-and-may-share-them-with-police/,2016-09-28 14:00:52+00:00
"Mac Mini (2024): Specs, Release Date, Price, Features","This desktop computer has its first design change since 2010, with a smaller footprint, vents at the bottom, and ports on the front.

There's Shark Week, and then there's Mac Week. It's a little less exciting, but Apple first announced a new iMac yesterday, and today we're being treated to a new Mac Mini. Tomorrow, there's a good chance you can expect a new MacBook Pro, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.

The Mac Mini is Apple's tiniest desktop computer and it's getting its first redesign in decades. Apple refreshed this machine early in 2023 with the M2 chipset, but the latest entry is powered by the all-new M4 Pro, a processor making its debut today. The M4 lineup improves on power efficiency and speed, and like its predecessor, it can take advantage of the new Apple Intelligence that rolled out this week in macOS Sequoia 15.1.

Apple's smallest desktop starts at $599 and is available for preorder now. It starts shipping on November 8.

Small but Mightier Than Ever

OK, remember when Apple said the Apple Watch Series 10 had an all-new design and it still looked pretty identical to every other Apple Watch? Yes, the small changes made the Series 10 more comfortable and nicer to wear, but new design is a bit of a stretch. That's kind of like the Mac Mini. It hasn't received a major redesign since 2010, but things are changing now.

The already small desktop computer is now even smaller—coming in at 5 x 5 inches. Despite the smaller footprint, it's a little taller, and the base slopes down with vents for airflow. It's still, for all intents and purposes, a metallic cube.

Apple has finally added ports to the front, making them easier to access. Two USB-C ports support the USB 3.0, and there's a 3.5-mm headphone jack. On the back, the M4-powered Mac Mini includes three Thunderbolt 4 ports while the M4 Pro version has three Thunderbolt 5 USB-C ports (another first—Thunderbolt 5 is the latest standard that supports up to 80 Gbps data transfer speeds and it's only available in very few devices at the moment). Both models also have an HDMI (for connecting an external display), an Ethernet connection (configurable up to 10 GB), and a port for the power cable. Apple has completely nixed the USB-A ports in this model.

Unlike the iPhone, which arrives exactly on time every September, Apple's desktop hardware can be a little more sporadic, and naturally, that means the processors powering these machines aren't chronological. The last Mac Mini had the M2 chip, and no, this one doesn't have the M3, but the M4 instead. There are two types to choose from: M4 or M4 Pro.

The M4 chip has a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU, while the M4 Pro has an up to 14-core CPU and up to 20-core GPU. Apple claims the M4 delivers 1.8 times faster CPU performance and 2.2 times faster GPU performance than the M1. The neural engine for both chips is over three times faster (it's also twice as fast as the M3).

The M4 Pro is the step up if you need more processing power for heavy-duty tasks. It supports accelerated ray tracing (another first for the Mini), a feature originally introduced with the M3 chips last year. It allows game developers to accurately illustrate lighting elements like shadows and reflections. Coupled with an advanced 16-core neural engine, this one will likely be able to handle more games and graphically intensive tasks than the base model.

You can connect the M4 and M4 Pro-powered Mac Mini to more than one external monitor. The entry-level chip can support up to two 6K resolution displays and up to one 5K resolution display. Meanwhile, the M4 Pro can support up to three 6K resolution displays (at 60 Hz).

There are also increased memory options. The Mac Mini starts with 16 GB of RAM (double from its predecessor), but you can upgrade this up to 32 GB of RAM. If you choose the M4 Pro, you can get up to 64 GB. These new features should allow those computing-heavy artificial intelligence features to run more fluidly. Apple Intelligence is now available in macOS 15.1, with features like Writing Tools, Smart Reply in Messages, Summaries for transcriptions in the Notes app, Clean Up in Photos, and more. You can read all about these features in our roundup.

There's probably no reason to upgrade from an M1 Mac Mini from 2020, only if you have something older. We'll have a review of this mighty little machine soon, but this desktop computer has always been the entry-level computer for anyone who wants a permanent fixture on a desk instead of a MacBook. That isn't changing here, though more people will likely be satisfied with the power the new Mac Mini can put out than ever.",Wired,https://www.wired.com/story/apple-mac-mini-2024/,2024-10-29 11:00:00-04:00
Best Apple AirPods Deal 2024: Where to Find Cheap AirPods,"You don't have to pay full price for Apple's top-rated earbuds and headphones — here's how to get them at a discount

Apple‘s top-selling AirPods (and wired EarPods) are a staple in most of our pockets or bags, and for good reason. The headphones and earbuds are not only some of the best-looking audio devices on the market, but they also deliver sharp sound quality and better integration with Apple devices than options from other brands.

But Apple knows just how much we all love AirPods, and they price the earbuds and headphones accordingly. Retail prices for the AirPods line generally range from $169 for the AirPods (3rd Gen) to close to $550 for the AirPods Pro Max headphones.

However, here’s a secret: You don’t have to pay full price for Apple AirPods. Amazon has discounted a ton of Apple headphones and earbuds during the retailer’s Prime Big Deal Days event, which comes to an end today, Oct. 9. (To take advantage of the discounts, you’ll need an Amazon Prime membership — or test out a 30-day free trial now.)

Whether you’re looking for affordable basic AirPods, AirPods Pros, or top-of-the-line AirPods Max headphones, there’s almost always somewhere to find them at a discount, including today during Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Days. Read on for a full guide on scoring AirPods deals (before they’re gone).

Best Prime Day Apple AirPods Deals

The Apple AirPods (3rd Generation) are another great daily go-to pair for listening to music and taking calls. The super comfortable buds are sweat and water-resistant — an upgrade from the older generation above. You also get more battery life at 30 hours with the included wireless charging case. Another big upgrade from the 2nd Gen AirPods is that the new buds offer spatial audio: A clearer, more detailed way to hear your music. Sound seemingly “floats” around you rather than directly at you, making for a wider, more impressive sound space.

If you’re looking for noise-cancelling earbuds, it’s hard to beat the AirPods Pros. Even compared to more expensive noise-cancelling headphones, I find the AirPods Pros to block more sound while offering very solid, rich sound for such a small package. Their easy connectivity, style, and noise-cancellation powers make the AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) our favorite earbuds.

Apple’s AirPods Max combine great audio quality in a premium over-ear headphone design. They feature active noise cancelling to help seal off outside noise when you’re listening to music, or taking a call. Switch over to “transparency mode” when you want to listen to music but still hear the environment around you (say, to hear traffic while you’re running or to chat with a co-worker).

Apple's Airpods Pro 2 has a new hearing aid function,"Some Apple AirPods wireless headphones can be used as hearing aids with a new software update available Monday. It’s a high-profile move that experts applaud, even if they only reach a small portion of the millions of Americans with hearing loss.

An estimated 30 million people — 1 in 8 Americans over the age of 12 — have hearing loss in both ears. Millions would benefit from hearing aids but most have never tried them, according to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders. Countless others have tried them, but don’t use them because of cost, poor quality, poor fit, how they look or for other reasons.

Over the past few years, there’s been a push to change that. Two years ago, federal rules changed to allow hearing aids to be sold over-the-counter, a move that many hoped would bring better and cheaper options to patients. And last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved software from Apple that would turn AirPods Pro 2 into hearing aids.

It’s unclear yet whether the rule changed has helped, experts say. But turning AirPods into hearing aids is the kind of creative move advocates had hoped for. Here’s what to know about hearing loss, hearing aids, and Apple’s new option.

Hearing loss can contribute to isolation, dementia, even fall risk

About 15% of Americans report some difficulty hearing. Most people with hearing loss are over 60, but hearing problems don’t only affect older people. One study found men and people living in rural areas are more likely to have hearing loss.

And it has been linked to many health effects beyond the ear. It contributes to isolation, depression and cognitive decline, experts say. It raises dementia risk and rewires the brain. It’s also been linked to an increased risk of falls — a major health concern among older adults.

“Everything we do, all our relationships, whether it’s personal or in our work life, involve hearing conversation,” said Barbara Kelley, executive director of Hearing Loss Association of America. “We’re finding now that the sooner that people can pay attention to their hearing health, the better.”

You don’t need to see a doctor to get a hearing aid

Before the 2022 rule change by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, everyone had to see a doctor and get a prescription for a hearing aid to get one. Now, they’re available without one.

“As more of them are sold, then hopefully the price will go down,” said Elizabeth Stangl, an audiologist at the University of Iowa. “But we haven’t seen a big rush to get them.”

Even buying over-the-counter, a decent hearing aid can easily run you $400 to $500, said Stangl, who researches how well people adjust to using hearing aids. And some of the less expensive options are really just “cheap amplifiers,” lacking the personalized level settings and noise canceling features that really make hearing aids helpful.

How does the Apple AirPods hearing aid feature work?

The hearing aid feature is available with AirPods Pro 2 models, and requires an iPhone or iPad to set it up. It starts with built-in tests that will help users determine if they have hearing loss, set up the feature if they do, and set personalized amplification levels.

The headphones sell for $249 on Apple’s website, and sometimes less from other retailers.

While there are many other earbud-type devices that can function the same way, experts agreed that the AirPods addition is a good one, simply because of the way it could help normalize hearing aids.

“It’s just mainstream,” Kelley said. The ubiquity of AirPods could make people worried about the look of a hearing aid more open to using them.

There may be some drawbacks, though. Fit and comfort during long use might be an issue. And while other hearing aids are built to last through a whole day or more, Stangl said the battery life of the AirPods won’t allow for that. She also noted that wearing earbuds can send a message to others that the person doesn’t want to be disturbed or spoken to.

“But we’re hoping that more people will try it and realize, ‘Yeah, these do help,’” she said.

Tips for buying OTC hearing aids

Stangl suggests people do plenty of research before buying. She said Facebook and Reddit forums can be especially helpful in vetting devices. The websites Hearing Tracker and Soundly also have reliable reviews and resources for selecting a hearing aid, she said.

The Hearing Loss Association of America and American Academy of Audiology have guides to buying a hearing aid at their websites. If you are stuck, consult an audiologist.

Look for devices that allow you to adjust different pitches. Most people with hearing loss have the hardest time hearing higher pitches, so find a device that can adjust amplification across frequencies.

To avoid the piercing whistle of feedback, buy a device that has a “feedback manager.” Fit is critical, but beware: it might not necessarily be the one that’s initially the most comfortable, so take your time.

Can you use your FSA or HSA money to buy OTC hearing aids — or even AirPods?

Pre-tax money stashed away in flexible spending accounts or health savings accounts can be used to buy hearing aids, including ones sold over the counter.

Does this mean you can score a new set of AirPods Pro2 with pre-tax money? Experts say it’s a gray area that hasn’t been tested yet, so be wary. You may even need a letter of medical necessity. It’s best to check with an accountant before you try it.

Your smartphone can help you even without hearing aids

Even if you can’t afford the latest and greatest tech, your smartphone can be a tool to protect and improve your hearing.

Most phones can now turn speech into text, which can help facilitate conversations. iPhone’s “Live Listen” feature turns your phone into an amplifying microphone that can beam your dinner date’s voice right to your ear even if you’re in a noisy restaurant.

There are also many apps and websites that can help beyond hearing aids. Some apps can vibrate your phone if an alarm is going off or the dog is barking. The University of Iowa gathers training resources through its Resource Center for Auditory Training. Free apps like the World Health Organization’s “hearWHO” offer hearing tests and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health’s Sound Level Meter App lets you measure if noise levels are dangerous.

“The majority of people own smart phones and don’t realize all that their phone can do, including functioning as a good amplifier for people with mild to moderate hearing loss,” said Catherine Palmer, director of audiology at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and former president of the American Academy of Audiology. “This has made hearing care accessible to many.”

"With expansion in India, Apple bolsters global manufacturing ","Apple's release this month of its iPhone 16, new Apple Watch, and AirPods, is creating a buzz among consumers. This year's lineup also marks something else that's new — the role India played in Apple's global rollout as a manufacturer of the iPhone Pro for the first time.

That milestone comes as global corporations are seeking to diversify their production away from China and as competition between the two Asian rivals heats up, analysts say.

Apple first began making iPhones in India in 2017, beginning with the iPhone SE. The move signaled Apple's intent to diversify its supply chains away from China, a move that other tech conglomerates, such as Microsoft and Amazon, made as well, shifting manufacturing away from China to countries such as India and Vietnam.

Foxconn expands to India

Apple's supply chain diversification gained steam during the COVID-19 pandemic when a Foxconn factory unexpectedly closed in China, following clashes between Chinese workers and security personnel over wages and Beijing's strict COVID lockdowns, which impacted factory operations.

Foxconn is Apple's largest contractor and produces more than two-thirds of Apple's iPhones, according to Thibault Denamiel, an associate fellow and Scholl Chair in International Business at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

According to Denamiel, the Taiwan-based contractor currently produces around 80% of its iPhones in Zhengzhou, known as ""iPhone City,"" and recently opened a new $138 million headquarters in China. However, it has also expanded its operations abroad with significant investments in manufacturing hubs in India.

In 2023, Foxconn made a $1.5 billion investment in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, built a $600 million plant in Karnataka, and built a $500 million plant in Telangana. These investments were made in preparation for the assembly of the new iPhone 16 lineup.

Multinational welcome mat

Jonathan Ward, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, noted that India has been receptive to investments and promoted efforts to attract business from large multinational companies.

""It remains a huge opportunity for them [India] and there have been strategic initiatives such as Sagar Mala and Make it India, in particular, that show, I think a directional desire to gain from this opportunity,"" he explained to VOA.

New Delhi has offered subsidies to companies in order to boost the manufacturing of IT hardware domestically under India's PLI 2.0 Scheme for IT Hardware. Foxconn is one of the companies that received benefits from these subsidies, which include revenue-based annual payouts to manufacturers.

Monish Tourangbam, director at the Kalinga Institute of Indo-Pacific Studies, said India possesses several key advantages as it seeks to expand its manufacturing sector. He said India has political predictability, an appetite for structural economic reforms, a competitive level of market forces and domestic consumption.

'Entering the game'

However, Tourangbam said India lags behind China in terms of labor skills and maturity, as Beijing has a long history of mass producing high quality electronic goods.

""Yes, in India's case you have a very big demographic dividend, a young workforce, but that young workforce has to be skilled in the right way,"" he told VOA. ""India is entering the game right now, but the Chinese have a longer experience of a workforce which is required for this kind of job [producing electronics] and I think we are just seeing the beginning of this.""

Ward agreed but added there is a big gap between India and China's manufacturing experience.

""At this point, China has spent 30 years building an enormous industrial base, which is larger than that of the United States, and they've invested very specifically in key strategic industries and have become a critical part of today's electronic supply chain,"" he said. ""Whereas India has not done that, it does not have that history, and ... therefore the workforce, services, all of that ... has been, I think, built accordingly.""

Ward said that even though India may be behind China in terms of their industrial base, companies' fear of geopolitical risks with China ""bode well for India's future.""

""The geopolitical risks of commercial engagement with China or China-based supply chains are becoming so large that both at a government level and at a national strategic level as well as at a corporate level, people have to go and look for future manufacturing opportunities, particularly in electronics, because that's where the bulk of China's trading value is concentrated,"" he said.

Denamiel also said geopolitical factors will play a role as to where companies will decide to manufacture.

""Geopolitical factors play an increasingly large role on where companies choose to invest – because their ability to grow their operations and access customers is increasingly tied to geopolitical developments, which are currently complicating the global trade landscape,"" he said in an email to VOA.

Tourangbam said geopolitical factors will be included in companies' manufacturing strategies. But he said companies' diversification should not be thought of as leaving China, but rather as a ""China plus one strategy.""

""It's not … we are finding this alternative like India and Vietnam, we are totally moving out of China,"" he said. ""A lot of headlines seem to make it like that, but I don't think that's the case. So it's a China plus one and not a minus China strategy.""",Voice Of America,https://www.voanews.com/a/apple-bolsters-global-manufacturing-with-expansion-in-india/7783792.html,2024-09-15 06:53:11+00:00
The Vision Pro needs apps. Now is not a good time for Apple to be at odds with developers.,"Apple will make its biggest hardware launch in a decade once the Vision Pro goes on sale this week.

As with any big hardware launch, Apple will need developers onside to help make it a success.

But the company has angered those very developers with recent changes to the App Store.

When Apple launches the Vision Pro on Friday, it could really do with developers lapping it up.

Since introducing its App Store in 2008 with 500 apps, the company has depended on developers to come up with apps that help turn products like the iPhone, Mac, and iPad into a consumer hit. Apps now number almost two million.

The $3,500 headset will mark a new era of uncertainty for the company once it goes on sale in the US this week. It's an era in which it will attempt to gain traction for mixed reality technologies that are yet to hit the mainstream.

Given the price tag, Apple watchers aren't expecting the Vision Pro to fly off the shelves immediately. Some analysts expect unit shipments to max out at 350,000 this year – a figure that will add little to the $383 billion Apple made in revenue in 2023.

To spur future consumer sales then, Apple really needs developers onside to help make the Vision Pro a success. They'll need to be ready and willing to build for the new ""spatial computing"" paradigm Apple wants to popularize.

Right now, though, developers are infuriated with the company.

'A masterclass in distortion'

Apple made a bunch of changes to its App Store in the European Union last week that developers say hurts them.

The changes, implemented to comply with the bloc's Digital Markets Act, allow third-party digital stores onto Apple's operating systems. In theory, it means developers aren't strictly limited to releasing their apps to Apple users through its own App Store.

Reasons cited by developers for wanting to skirt Apple's App Store are plenty but primarily relate to a 30% commission that Apple has historically taken on any apps that are bought and sold through its digital marketplace.

That's why the second change introduced by Apple is a cut on that commission from 30% to 17%, plus a 3% fee for payment processing.

On the surface, these changes appear to be wins for developers. They were made, after all, in response to laws that designated the App Store's usual way of operating as unfair and anticompetitive.

But developers have been quick to note how the changes come with a lot of strings attached that make life very difficult for them.

Spotify boss Daniel Ek said last week to suggest that the new rules were a ""masterclass in distortion"" thanks to a new fee structure introduced by Apple that ""looks attractive on the surface but has potentially even higher fees"" for developers to cough up.

The fee structure Ek mentioned specifically refers to a new €0.50 fee that must be paid by developers for each ""first annual install per year over a 1 million threshold.""

""In Apple's 'new' world, the fees could be astronomical. Picture this: A popular free app with tens or hundreds of millions EU users, now faces a tax on every download and update annually,"" Ek wrote in an X post.

Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, meanwhile, pointed to fine print that shows how Apple will still control which third-party apps are allowed to compete with it.

""They could block Epic from launching the Epic Games Store and distributing Fortnite through it, for example, or block Microsoft, Valve, Good Old Games, or new entrants,"" Sweeney wrote.

Developers souring on Apple is not something the company will want ahead of its biggest product launch in a decade.

Apple has said that the changes comply with the DMA, and that it has ""created new tools for developers, such as a fee calculator and developer documentation"" to help them understand the new policies.

Apps currently being built for the Vision Pro won't be impacted immediately by the rule changes in the EU either, as the Vision Pro will only go on sale in the US to begin with.

However, frustrations shared by the likes of Ek and Sweeney suggest developers won't be placated so easily once it does go on sale there.

More broadly, it puts Apple and developers at odds with each other at a moment when Apple really needs apps for Vision Pro. As Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reported last week, roughly 230 native apps are ready for release.

If Apple wants more, it may need to address developer concerns about App Store changes more directly.

Bucs grapple with gearing up for gameday as Milton hits home,"The Buccaneers fled Florida days before Hurricane Milton hit the devastated the Tampa Bay area, and as they turn their attention to the New Orleans Saints this weekend, there is definitely more on their minds than just a football game.

Tampa Bay has attempted to refocus on their Week 6 matchup against the Saints while in New Orleans, coming off a tough overtime loss against the Atlanta Falcons.

""We're not even just playing for just football now. We're trying to play for something a little bit bigger,"" Bucs wide receiver Mike Evans told reporters on Wednesday, via ESPN.

Evans is used to the chaos that a hurricane forecast brings. He grew up in Galveston, Texas, which is no stranger to the impact a massive storm can bring.

""I just want everybody to be safe at the end of the day,"" he said.

""We obviously have a job to do, so we’re going to do that. The games are still going to be played. The hardest thing is just making sure everybody is good, then just praying and hoping for the best.""

The Buccaneers moved their operations to the New Orleans area, practicing at Tulane’s Yulman Stadium. After practice, team members and personnel were bussed back to their hotel rooms that are being shared with family members and pets.

""Family is the most important thing right now. … If you can get your family out and keep them safe, everything else can be replaced,"" Bucs coach Todd Bowles said.

""We understand the things we do in football are a small (part) in the game of life and how a hurricane is going to affect people,"" he said. ""Everybody is here, and their families are here. That makes it a lot easier.""

The Glazer family, which owns the Buccaneers, chartered two planes for a traveling party of around 350 people and 31 pets.

Bowles said having the families and pets at the hotel brought its own set of challenges while trying to maintain some sort of normalcy with its practice routine.

""Learning from that, we’re a little more organized as far as when we meet, when the families eat, how they eat,"" Bowles said. ""So it’s a little, I don’t want to say easier, but a little more structured this time around.""

As Milton made landfall on Wednesday night, the Buccaneers had the entire state of Florida in their thoughts and prayers.",Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/bucs-grapple-gearing-up-gameday-milton-hits-home,2024-10-10 07:25:20-04:00
Caitlin Clark's new boss to change her team's brand to be 'like Apple' amid WNBA pros calling its fans racist,"Caitlin Clark has brought so much attention and popularity to the Indiana Fever, that the team's new president has big ambitions for its brand.

The Fever's new president of basketball and business operations, Kelly Krauskopf, said she wants to make the Fever's brand like the tech company Apple, during her introductory press conference on Tuesday.

""We have a foundational player in Caitlin Clark, and we're going to continue to add to that. But I want this team to be a leader in the country and an enduring brand like Apple. We have a real opportunity here,"" Krauskopf said.

For Krauskopf, Clark's presence on the team gives the organization a chance to reach a new generation of fans. She plans to be very forward-thinking in terms of who the team will be marketing itself too. She suggested the team will look to move on to focusing on a new demographic, compared to the fans that it appealed to when it won its only WNBA championship in 2012.

""This is the moment where it takes a generation some time to get to that level,"" Krauskopf said. ""I would tell our players, ‘Look, we’re building this for someone else. We're building this for someone's 10-year-old daughter now,' because that's what you do. We wanted to keep moving it forward, pushing it forward and paying it forward.""

""I know what kind of support we have and we have it and that's where I feel empowered and very confident in the direction that we're going because we have that level of support.""Krauskopf also pointed out that Clark was 10 years old when the Fever won its first title. Now she believes that Clark will give the team a distinct recruiting advantage as it looks to evolve its brand and grow its fan base.

""If you're a smart basketball player and you watch the way [Caitlin Clark] plays, you would want to play with her,"" Krauskopf said.

However, Krauskopf will be looking to give the Fever this reputation after a season in which multiple WNBA players have criticized the Fever fans and accused them of being ""racist.""

After the team's loss to the Connecticut Sun in the first round of the playoffs, multiple Sun players spoke out against Fever fans and alleged they used racist language against them.

""Honestly, it's been a lot of nonsense. I think in my 11-year career, I've never experienced the racial comments [like I have] from the Indiana Fever fan base,"" Sun player Alyssa Thomas said after the Sun won the series on Sept. 25. ""It's unacceptable, honestly. There's no place for it.""

Thomas went so far as to say the Fever must intervene to halt their fans' actions.

""We don't want fans that are going to degrade us and call us racial names,"" Thomas said. ""We already see what's happening in the world and what we have to deal with in that aspect. We come to play basketball for our job, and it's fun, but we don't want to go to work every day and have social media blown up over things like that. It's uncalled for and something needs to be done, whether it's [the Fever] checking their fans or this league checking. There's no time for it anymore.""

Fellow Sun player DiJonai Carrington, who gave Clark a black eye in Game 1 of the playoff series, insulted the Fever fan base after Indiana defeated Connecticut 84-80 on Aug. 28.

""The Indiana Fever have the nastiest fans in the [WNBA]. Ew,"" Carrington wrote in a post on X that night.

Meanwhile, Clark's longtime rival and Chicago Sky rookie Angel Reese has accused Clark's fans, both for the Fever and her fans during Clark's college career at Iowa, of racism, death threats and even sending explicitly AI-generated images of Reese to her family members.

""I think it's really just the fans, her fans, the Iowa fans, now the Indiana fans, that are really just, they ride for her, and I respect that, respectfully. But sometimes it's very disrespectful. I think there's a lot of racism when it comes to it,"" Reese said during the first episode of her podcast on Sept. 5.

""People have come down to my address, followed me home, it's come down to that… Multiple occasions, people have made AI-images of me naked. They have sent it to my family members. My family members are like uncles, sending it to me like, ‘Are you naked on Instagram?’""

Clark herself addressed the allegations of racism against Fever fans during the team's exit interview. However, Clark did not acknowledge that the individuals accused of racism are fans of her or her team.

""Those aren't fans. Those are trolls,"" Clark said.

Regardless, the influx of followers Clark brought to Indiana and the WNBA as a whole is undeniable.

The WNBA broke viewership and attendance records this year, spearheaded by Clark's presence on the team. The 14 most-watched WNBA games this year all included the Fever, and the team's season finale against the Washington Mystics on Sept. 19 broke the record for most-attended game in WNBA history with 20,711 attendees after it was moved to a larger arena.

Clark drew a WNBA record 1.84 million viewers to her first playoff game against the Connecticut Sun on Sept. 22, while competing with NFL Sunday. She followed it up with another record audience of 2.54 million viewers for Game 2. Clark and the Indiana Fever lost both those games, however, sending Clark home for the offseason.

However, once Clark and the Fever were eliminated from the playoffs, viewership plummeted. The first game between the Aces and Liberty, a rematch of last year's WNBA finals between two of the league's most popular and successful teams, drew an audience of 929,000, ESPN announced, which is 50% less than the Fever's Game 1 against the Sun.

Now Krauskopf will look to use that ammunition to build up the team's brand, all while accusations of racism against the fan base by other players may potentially continue.",Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/caitlin-clarks-new-boss-change-her-teams-brand-like-apple-amid-wnba-pros-calling-its-fans-racist,2024-10-08 15:13:40-04:00
US writer Anne Applebaum appeals for arms for Ukraine as she accepts German peace prize,"WARSAW, Poland (AP) — The prominent American journalist and historian Anne Applebaum urged continued support for Ukraine as she accepted a prestigious German prize on Sunday, arguing that pacifism in the face of aggression is often nothing more than appeasement.

Applebaum made her appeal to an audience in Frankfurt, where she was awarded the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade. She was joined by her husband, Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski, who like his wife is a strong voice on the international stage for supporting Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia’s brutal invasion.

“If there is even a small chance that military defeat could help end this horrific cult of violence in Russia, just as military defeat once brought an end to the cult of violence in Germany, we should take it,” Applebaum said.

Many Germans have embraced an ethos of pacifism as a result of their nation’s aggression under Adolf Hitler during World War II. And many have misgivings now about supplying weapons to Kyiv, fearing Russia and worried that it could cause the war to spread beyond Ukraine’s borders to the rest of Europe.

“Some even call for peace by referring solemnly to the ‘lessons of German history,” Applebaum noted, according to a transcript of her speech published by the prize organization.

“As I am here today accepting a peace prize, this seems the right moment to point out that ‘I want peace’ is not always a moral argument,” Applebaum said. “This is also the right moment to say that the lesson of German history is not that Germans should be pacifists.”

“On the contrary, we have known for nearly a century that a demand for pacifism in the face of an aggressive, advancing dictatorship can simply represent the appeasement and acceptance of that dictatorship.”

She argued that the “real lesson” from German history should be that Germans “have a special responsibility to stand up for freedom and to take risks in doing so.”

The prize, which is endowed with 25,000 euros ($27,185), was awarded in St. Paul’s Church in Frankfurt — which is considered the birthplace of German parliamentary democracy — at the end of the Frankfurt Book Fair.

The prize has been awarded since 1950. It honours individuals who have contributed to turning the idea of peace into reality through literature, science or art. Last year’s prize was awarded to British-Indian writer Salman Rushdie for his perseverance despite enduring decades of threats and violence.

The German news agency dpa reported that Applebaum’s strong support for continuing to arm Ukraine triggered some criticism, citing Karin Schmidt-Friderichs, the head of the German Publishers and Booksellers Association, which awards the prize.

Nonetheless she received strong applause for her speech, dpa reported from Frankfurt.

Following pacifism to its logical conclusion, Applebaum argued, would “mean that we should acquiesce to the military conquest of Ukraine, to the cultural destruction of Ukraine, to the construction of concentration camps in Ukraine, to the kidnapping of children in Ukraine.”

Applebaum writes for The Atlantic magazine. She has written books that focus on totalitarianism in Eastern Europe, including “The Gulag,” and “The Iron Curtain” and “Red Famine,” about dictator Joseph Stalin’s war on Ukraine. She recently published “Autocracy, Inc. The Dictators Who Want to Run the World.” In 2004, she was awarded the prestigious Pulitzer Prize.

The prize jury said Applebaum’s analyses of communist and post-communist systems in the Soviet Union and Russia reveal “the mechanisms by which authoritarians grab hold of power and maintain their control.”

You Can Now Pre Order The New iPad Mini (or Save on Previous Models),"Apple announced the 7th generation iPad Mini today, and retailers have slashed prices on the iPad 10 and iPad Mini 6

Apple announced a new iPad Mini today, refreshing the iPad Mini line for the first time since 2021. The new iPad features an A17 Pro chip, which is the same chip used in last year’s iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max models. The new iPad Mini is compatible with the Apple Pencil Pro and has an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display. It’s available to pre-order now and will be available to buy on Oct. 23.

The biggest addition to the iPad Mini is Apple Intelligence, the Cupertino company’s take on AI which includes new writing tools for productivity and the ability to create custom avatars, which Apple calls Genmojis. Apple announced that Apple Intelligence would be available on the iPhone 16 at its September “Glowtime” event. Apple Intelligence was not ready by the time the new iPhone started shipping out, but Apple has said it will be available on iOs 18 later this month. Apple Intelligence will roll out the iPad Mini later.

The iPad Mini marks the third new iPad release this year, following the iPad Air and the iPad Pro, which were unveiled in May. The 10th generation iPad was released in 2022. The iPad Mini will retail for $499, which is half the price of the iPad Pro, and the palm-sized tablet has been an enduringly popular option for users who prize portability over power.

In addition to iOS 18, the iPad Mini is getting other upgrades, including 128GB of storage, which is double the storage of the previous generation. Given Apple’s (somewhat grudging) transition to USB-C, the new iPad Mini will also feature a USB-C port, like the previous generation. The USB-C port has been upgraded with data transfers up to 10Gbps, making it a good option for people who use their iPad to store photos and videos.

As is typical with the release of new tech, the announcement of the iPad Mini brought discounts to earlier iPad generations, including the iPad 9 and 10. You can check out the deals below, including savings of up to $100.

The 10th generation iPad is now $50 off, dropping it to under $300. It’s the lowest price in 30 days.

The 9th generation iPad, released in 2021, is also on sale. The 64GB version, which is typically $329.99, is now available for $229.99. The 256 GB version is also $100 off.

If you don’t want to wait for the latest iPad Mini, you can pick up the last generation for $100 off for the 64GB model, dropping the price to $400. The 256GB model is available for $549.99, which is also $100 off.",Rolling Stone,https://www.rollingstone.com/product-recommendations/electronics/ipad-mini-2024-apple-where-to-buy-1235134374/,2024-10-15 19:59:57+00:00
China's economy softens in August as Beijing grapples with lagging demand,"China's economy softened in August, extending a slowdown in industrial activity and real estate prices as Beijing faces pressure to ramp up spending to stimulate demand.

Data published by the National Bureau of Statistics Saturday showed weakening activity across industrial production, retail sales and real estate this month compared to July.

""We should be aware that the adverse impacts arising from the changes in the external environment are increasing,"" said Liu Aihua, the bureau's chief economist in a news conference.

Liu said that demand remained insufficient at home, and the sustained economic recovery still confronts multiple difficulties and challenges.

China has been grappling with a lagging economy post-COVID, with weak consumer demand, persistent deflationary pressures and a contraction in factory activity.

Chinese leaders have ramped up investment in manufacturing to rev up an economy that stalled during the pandemic and is still growing slower than hoped.

Beijing also has to deal with increasing pressure to implement large-scale stimulus measures to boost economic growth.

While industrial production rose by 4.5% in August compared to a year ago, it declined from July's 5.1% growth, according to the bureau's data released.

Retail sales grew 2.1% from the same time last year, slower than the 2.7% increase last month.

Fixed asset investment rose by 3.4% from January to August, down from 3.6% in the first seven months.

Meanwhile, investment in real estate declined by 10.2% from January to August, compared to last year.

The figures released Saturday come after trade data for August saw imports grow just 0.5% compared to a year ago.

The consumer price index rose 0.6% in August, missing forecasts according to data released Monday. Officials attributed the higher CPI to an increase in food prices due to bad weather.

But the core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose by just 0.3% in August, the slowest in over three years.",Voice Of America,https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-economy-softens-in-august-as-beijing-grapples-with-lagging-demand/7784816.html,2024-09-15 00:12:33+00:00
Apple was just forced to crack open its App Store — but the changes are already being called 'hot garbage' ,"Apple just did something unthinkable: it opened up its App Store.

The iPhone maker changed the way app distribution works on iPhones to comply with a new EU law.

It should be a win for developers, but many are complaining.

Apple's absolute rule over the App Store has just been broken for the first time since its launch in 2008.

Are developers celebrating? Hardly.

On Thursday, changes were made to the way app distribution works on iPhones — changes that should have been welcomed by developers who have long been at the mercy of strict rules around that process.

Specifically, the changes take effect in the European Union, where Apple has been pushed to comply with the Digital Markets Act by March this year.

It's a law that designates the App Store, which takes a 30% commission from developers, as an unfair ""gatekeeper"" by acting as the only digital store from which apps can be sold and bought on iPhones.

'Hot garbage'

Despite trying to retain that control ruthlessly over the years, Apple's changes in the face of the EU legislation mean two main things for developers.

First, third-party stores will finally be allowed onto Apple's operating system once iOS 17.4 is released. It means developers can simply bypass the App Store. Second, Apple's cut on transactions will drop from 30% to 17%, with an extra 3% fee for use of its payment processing.

As my colleague Peter Kafka writes, this has all made Apple quite unhappy. In a release announcing the changes, Apple said this new system under the EU act ""opens new avenues for malware, fraud and scams,"" as well as other harmful content.

But it seems to have made a lot of people quite unhappy too.

Tim Sweeney, CEO of Fortnite-maker Epic Games, described the changes as ""hot garbage"" as he pointed to the fine print that seemingly complicates matters for developers.

Apple, for instance, will have tight control over which third-party app stores end up on its system and compete with it. Apple said this was ""to ensure marketplace developers commit to ongoing requirements that help protect users and developers."" Sweeney suggests otherwise.

""Apple proposes that it can choose which stores are allowed to compete with their App Store,"" Sweeney wrote on X.

""They could block Epic from launching the Epic Games Store and distributing Fortnite through it, for example, or block Microsoft, Valve, Good Old Games, or new entrants.""

Nikita Bier, who founded businesses acquired by Discord and Meta, took aim at a new ""core technology fee"" being introduced by Apple. The fee means that apps sold from its App Store or third-party marketplaces will have to pay ""€0.50 for each first annual install per year over a 1 million threshold.""

Using Apple's own fee calculator, he estimated that companies that made $10 million in sales from 10 million customers would result in an annual cut of $6.2 million for Apple. However, when the revenue per user was placed to higher than $1, it resulted in much better returns for app makers.

Eric Seufert, general partner at Heracles Capital, noted that the fee ""presents an appreciable financial hurdle to clear"" for apps that are downloaded from third-party stores, seemingly defeating the purpose of those stores being allowed onto iOS in the first place.

""It seems odd to me that the European Commission would approve these platforms charging fees on apps that are sideloaded / downloaded from third-party stores,"" Seufert said.

Others, like Ashley Gullen, lead developer of game-making software Construct, likened Apple's new fee structure to a controversial install fee introduced by Unity last year.

Unity, creator of a game engine platform, initially planned on charging developers $0.20 per install for games with over 200,000 installs, but later revised the plans after facing backlash.

In a statement, Apple said its changes, which came after spending months in conversation with the European Commission, comply with the DMA.

However, it said it would limit the changes to the EU because it is ""concerned about their impacts on the privacy and security"" of users.

""Apple's focus remains on creating the most secure system possible within the DMA's requirements. But even with these safeguards in place, many risks remain — and in the EU, the DMA's changes will result in a less secure system,"" the company said.

It added that it created new tools for developers, such as a fee calculator and developer documentation, to help them ""understand the options available for their EU apps and make informed decisions.""

Developers will be forced to reckon with a whole new reality of app distribution that they've barely begun to grasp.

As Epic Games' Sweeney put it: ""It will take more time to parse both the written and unwritten parts of this new horror show, so stay tuned.""

"Jenna Fischer Talks Cancer, Christina Applegate Support on 'Today'","The actress — now cancer-free — discussed undergoing chemo and more in her first big interview since revealing her diagnosis

Jenna Fischer spoke about her decision to keep doing the Office Ladies podcast while keeping her breast cancer diagnosis private, as well as the advice she got from fellow survivor Christina Applegate, in a new interview on Today.

The conversation with Hoda Kotb (also a breast cancer survivor) marks Fischer’s first major chat since revealing she was diagnosed with Stage 1 Triple Positive Breast Cancer earlier this month. While Fischer is now cancer-free, last year The Office star underwent a lumpectomy to remove the tumor, followed by chemotherapy and radiation.

Even amidst all that, Fischer kept up with her Office recap podcast with friend/co-star Angela Kinsey. “From the beginning, [Kinsey] said, ‘Whatever you need, you tell me. I’m here’,” Fischer recalled. “And I said, I want to keep working and I don’t want anyone to know at work. At work, I want that to be a space where we go, and we laugh, and I’m not a cancer patient. I need that.”

Not only did Kinsey agree, she found other ways to support and help Fischer. When Fischer began losing her hair during chemo, she would wear hats with wigs attached to them. Kinsey, Fischer said, “started wearing hats to work, so that I wouldn’t be the only person in a work meeting wearing a hat.”

Fischer also spoke about another key figure in her support system, Applegate, who helped connect Fischer with other survivors. Recalling the first conversation she had with Applegate about her diagnosis, Fischer said, “I called her, and she answered the phone, and she said, ‘Which one is it?’ And I said, ‘It’s breast cancer.’ And she said, ‘I effing knew it.’ She’s salty. Salty language that one. I love her for it.”

Elsewhere, Fischer spoke about her grueling chemo treatments, the difficulty of losing her hair, and learning to embrace her new short cut. Having come through treatment cancer-free, Fischer also shared how the experience has shifted her outlook on life.

“I find the world to be such a beautiful place in all of its quirkiness,” Fischer said. “Even things that used to irritate me, now I sometimes find charming. Like, you know, just traffic. Like, ‘Oh, look at you cute traffic! Look at all the people just going places. Oh, that guy’s mad!’”",Rolling Stone,https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/jenna-fischer-cancer-christina-applegate-today-1235139660/,2024-10-21 21:49:00+00:00
Apple faces challenges in Chinese market against Huawei's tri-fold phone,"The U.S.-China technology war is playing out in the smartphone market in China, where global rivals Apple and Huawei released new phones this week. Industry experts say Apple, which lacks home-field advantage, faces many challenges in defending its market share in the country.

The biggest highlight of the iPhone 16 is its artificial intelligence system, dubbed Apple Intelligence, while the Huawei Mate XT features innovative tri-fold screen technology. But at a starting price of RMB 19,999, about $2,810, the Mate XT will cost about three times as much as the iPhone 16.

According to data from VMall, Huawei's official shopping site, nearly 5.74 million people in China preordered the Mate XT as of late Thursday, 5½ days after Huawei began accepting preorders.

But in a survey conducted on the Chinese microblogging site Weibo by Radio France International, half of the 9,200 respondents said they would not purchase a Mate XT because the price is prohibitive. An additional 3,500 said they are not in the market for a new phone now.

""I suggest that Huawei release some products that ordinary people can afford,"" a Weibo user wrote under the name ""Diamond Man Yang Dong Feng.""

The iPhone 16 is not available for preorder until Friday, but some e-commerce vendors in China have promised to deliver the new devices to consumers within half a day to two days of sale.

In the competition between Apple and Huawei, iPhone 16 has some inherent disadvantages, said Shih-Fang Chiu, a senior industry analyst at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research.

""Apple's strength is information security and privacy, but this is difficult to achieve in the Chinese market, where the government can control the data in China's market to a relatively high degree. In the era of AI mobile phones, this will bring challenges to Apple's development in the Chinese market,"" Chiu said.

Apple’s AI service on its iPhone 16 will roll out at a gradual pace in different languages, first in English and other languages later this year. The Chinese version will not be available until 2025.

There are other challenges Apple faces as well, Chiu added, such as regulatory controls, consumer sentiment favoring local brands and weakening spending power amid China's economic slowdown.

According to Counterpoint Research's statistics, Huawei held a market share of 15% in the second quarter of 2024, surpassing Apple's 14% market share. That compares with Apple’s 17.3% share in 2023 as reported by the industry research firm International Data Corporation China, or IDC China.

Ryan Reith, the program vice president for IDC's Mobile Device Tracker suite, said in a written response to VOA that the iPhone 16 has not made significant hardware upgrades and that AI applications alone are not attractive because consumers have GPT and other AI solutions.

AI applications are also another hurdle. Analyst Chih-Yen Tai said iPhone 16's AI services involve personal data collection, information application and cloud computing, which will require collaboration with Chinese service providers.

That, along with the ban on Chinese civil servants and employees at state-owned enterprises from using their iPhone at work in recent years, will affect the sales of Apple products, said Tai, the deputy director of the Center for Science and Technology Policy Evaluation at Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research in Taipei.

""China's patriotism has led to a strong number of preorders” for Huawei's tri-fold phones, Tai said.

“The competitors in China will sell the idea [to consumers] that iPhones will soon be edged out of the premium smartphone market. So, in the next stage, the affordable iPhone versions will be the key to whether it [Apple] can return to China or its previous glorious sales era,"" Tai said.

Tzu-Ang Chen, a senior consultant in the digital technology industry in Taipei, said use of Huawei's HarmonyOS operating system surpassed that of Apple's iOS in China in the first quarter of this year, representing China's determination to ""go its own way"" and create ""one world, two systems.""

""The U.S.-China technology war has extended to smartphones,” Chen said. “IPhone sales in China will get worse and worse, obviously because Huawei is doing better, and coupled with patriotism, Apple's position in the hearts of 1.4 billion people will never return.""

He said that as China seeks to develop pro-China markets among member countries of the Belt and Road Initiative in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa, China-made mobile phones may become their first choice.

Chargers sign Eli Apple to practice squad after series of injuries at cornerback,"EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) — The Los Angeles Chargers signed Eli Apple to their practice squad on Monday after a wave of injuries at cornerback.

Apple was the 10th overall pick by the New York Giants in 2016, and this will be his sixth team. He was with the Miami Dolphins last season after two years with the Cincinnati Bengals. Apple has also played for the New Orleans Saints and Carolina Panthers.

He has played in 98 games with 82 starts in eight seasons. He has six interceptions along with 60 passes defended and 381 tackles.

The Bolts (3-2) placed starting cornerback Asante Samuel Jr. on injured reserve last Saturday after he suffered a shoulder injury during practice on Thursday. Their other starter, Kristian Fulton, strained a hamstring during the third quarter of Sunday’s 23-16 victory at Denver.

Backup Ja’Sir Taylor was inactive for the second straight game due to a leg injury while Deane Leonard, who is mostly used on special teams, also suffered a hamstring injury at Denver.

Rookies Cam Hart and Tarheeb Still, both selected in the fifth round of this year’s NFL draft, both played well in their first extensive action.

"There's a new place to buy refurbished Apple iPhones, MacBooks, and other tech products","Newegg is now selling refurbished computer parts and gadgets.

The online retailer could give Apple a run for its money in pre-owned devices.

Apple officially began selling refurbished iPhones in 2016, reports say.

There's a new online marketplace for used Apple products.

On January 25, electronics retailer Newegg launched Newegg Refreshed — which sells refurbished tech gadgets, including a selection of Apple MacBooks, Watches, iPhones, and more.

It inspects, cleans, and tests items before they're available for purchase, and if customers aren't satisfied, they have 90 days to return the device.

Still, while it might give Apple a run for its money in selling the brand's pre-owned devices, shoppers currently won't find massive bargains compared to Apple's own site. The tech giant has its own space for selling pre-owned tech, and prices are similar to Newegg for most devices. For example, a 2022 13.3-inch MacBook Pro costs $989 on Newegg compared to $999 for the same model on Apple's site.

But Newegg does have listings for refurbished units of the new iPhone 15, while the iPhone 12 is the most recent model Apple had on sale as of Friday morning. The tech giant began selling used iPhones in 2016, 9to5Mac reported. Supplies vary based on availability for both sites.

For those who prefer to use tech from outside the Apple family, Newegg has added refurbished options for computer parts and gadgets as part of its Refreshed program.

And if you're still not finding the right device on Newegg or Apple, electronics giant Best Buy also offers refurbished items at a discounted price in its outlets department.

"Ask Kurt: How does Apple AirTag work, how far can you track?","Apple AirTags have become a popular tool for keeping track of personal belongings, but their functionality and limitations can sometimes be misunderstood. Today, we’re addressing an insightful question from Duncan in Keller, Texas, about the tracking capabilities of AirTags, especially when used with pets and vehicles.

""Hi Kurt, I put an AirTag on my cat. Your article about tracking stolen cars using AirTags suggests you can track a stolen car the same way you can a person you share locations with. I have not found this to be the case. The app will only find the tag if you are within Bluetooth range. I wish this weren’t the case. Am I missing something?"" Duncan writes.

This excellent question highlights some common misconceptions about AirTags. Let’s dive into how AirTags work and explore their tracking capabilities and limitations.

The AirTag operates through Apple’s Find My network, which utilizes the hundreds of millions of other Apple devices around the globe to provide near-perfect tracking of your stuff. The way it works is that whenever an AirTag comes close to an Apple device like an iPhone that’s connected to the Find My network, that device transmits the location information back to the company’s servers, which in turn send that location information data back to the Airtag’s owner.

However, if you lose your AirTag in a remote area with no other Apple devices nearby, you will not be able to track it. AirTags can be tracked using Apple’s Find My network, but the location may be less precise if the AirTag is outside Bluetooth range.

Also, for the best experience, you’ll need a device with a U1 Ultra Wideband chip, which can more accurately determine the distance and direction of signals coming from the AirTag. These devices include the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max, as well as the iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max.

So, while the AirTag can be useful for tracking items within its limitations, it might not always work as expected in all situations.

The primary issue with using an AirTag as a pet tracker is that the precision finder can sometimes be a bit finicky. If you've used your AirTag to track a pet or even a lost pair of iPods, you've probably at some point seen the dreaded ""Signal is weak, try moving to a different location"" message. I've encountered this message even when I'm in line of sight with the AirTag in question, but the Find My app consistently refreshes, and I've never been led too far astray.

If you let your pet go outdoors or take it for hikes, and it slips out of its harness or collar, an AirTag might not be the best option for reuniting with your furry friend. This is because AirTags rely on nearby devices, such as iPhones, to relay their location to the Find My network. In rural or remote areas, there may not be enough devices around to help locate your pet. AirTags themselves do not form a mesh network or relay the location of other tags. If you are in a busy area, you should be able to track your pet more easily. One of the best parts of using a tracker like an Apple AirTag is that you can turn on lost mode, and if someone else were to scan the AirTag, you can set up a message about contacting you. What a relief, right?

If you’re looking for a reliable tracker to keep tabs on your pets, consider exploring GPS trackers designed specifically for animals. These devices attach to your pet’s collar and offer real-time tracking with no distance limit, ensuring you can always locate your furry friend. Such trackers are tailored for pet tracking, providing better results than general-purpose trackers. Check out the best pet trackers here.

While an Apple AirTag is a great way to find your lost iPhone or iPods, it's not the best tracking solution for pets due to the range of the Find My network and Bluetooth LE. However, if you want to track a pet, it's worth looking into the other tracking options available, especially those GPS trackers that are designed specifically for pets. When it comes to AirTags, it's best to use them for what they are built for: finding lost Apple devices.

"Google, Apple lose court fights against EU, owe billions in fines, taxes ","Google lost its last bid to overturn a European Union antitrust penalty, after the bloc's top court ruled against it Tuesday in a case that came with a whopping fine and helped jumpstart an era of intensifying scrutiny for Big Tech companies.

The European Union's top court rejected Google's appeal against the $2.7 billion penalty from the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc's top antitrust enforcer, for violating antitrust rules with its comparison shopping service.

Also Tuesday, Apple lost its challenge against an order to repay $14.34 billion in back taxes to Ireland, after the European Court of Justice issued a separate decision siding with the commission in a case targeting unlawful state aid for global corporations.

Both companies have now exhausted their appeals in the cases that date to the previous decade. Together, the court decisions are a victory for European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who is expected to step down next month after 10 years as the commission's top official overseeing competition.

Experts said the rulings illustrate how watchdogs have been emboldened in the years since the cases were first opened.

One of the takeaways from the Apple decision ""is the sense that, again, the EU authorities and courts are prepared to flex their [collective] muscles to bring Big Tech to heel where necessary,"" Alex Haffner, a competition partner at law firm Fladgate, said by email.

The shopping fine was one of three huge antitrust penalties for Google from the commission, which punished the Silicon Valley giant in 2017 for unfairly directing visitors to its own Google Shopping service over competitors.

""We are disappointed with the decision of the Court, which relates to a very specific set of facts,"" Google said in a brief statement.

The company said it made changes to comply with the commission's decision requiring it to treat competitors equally. It started holding auctions for shopping search listings that it would bid for alongside other comparison shopping services.

""Our approach has worked successfully for more than seven years, generating billions of clicks for more than 800 comparison shopping services,"" Google said.

European consumer group BEUC hailed the court's decision, saying it shows how the bloc's competition law ""remains highly relevant"" in digital markets.

""It is a good outcome for all European consumers at the end of the day,"" Director General Agustín Reyna said in an interview. ""It means that many smaller companies or rivals will be able to go to different comparison shopping sites. They don't need to depend on Google to reach out to customers.""

Google is still appealing its two other EU antitrust cases: a 2018 fine of $4.55 billion involving its Android operating system and a 2019 penalty of $1.64 billion over its AdSense advertising platform.

Despite the amounts of money involved, the adverse rulings will leave a small financial dent in one of the world's richest and most profitable companies. The combined bill of $17 billion facing Apple and Alphabet, Google's parent company, represents 0.3% of their combined market value of $5.2 trillion.

Those three cases foreshadowed expanded efforts by regulators worldwide to crack down on the tech industry. The EU has since opened more investigations into Big Tech companies and drew up a new law to prevent them from cornering online markets, known as the Digital Markets Act.

Google is also now facing pressure over its lucrative digital advertising business from the EU and Britain, which are carrying out separate investigations, and the United States, where the Department of Justice is taking the company to federal court over its alleged dominance in ad tech.

Apple failed in its last bid to avoid repaying its Irish taxes Tuesday after the Court of Justice upheld a lower court ruling against the company, in the dispute that dates back to 2016.

The case drew outrage from Apple, with CEO Tim Cook calling it ""total political crap.""",Voice Of America,https://www.voanews.com/a/google-apple-lose-court-fights-against-eu-owe-billions-in-fines-taxes-/7779133.html,2024-09-10 22:17:31+00:00
Apple Brings Mainland Chinese Web Censorship to Hong Kong,"When Safari users in Hong Kong recently tried to load the popular code-sharing website GitLab, they received a strange warning instead: Apple’s browser was blocking the site for their own safety. The access was temporarily cut off thanks to Apple’s use of a Chinese corporate website blacklist, which resulted in the innocuous site being flagged as a purveyor of misinformation. Neither Tencent, the massive Chinese firm behind the web filter, nor Apple will say how or why the site was censored.

The outage was publicized just ahead of the new year. On December 30, 2022, Hong Kong-based software engineer and former Apple employee Chu Ka-cheong tweeted that his web browser had blocked access to GitLab, a popular repository for open-source code. Safari’s “safe browsing” feature greeted him with a full-page “deceptive website warning,” advising that because GitLab contained dangerous “unverified information,” it was inaccessible. Access to GitLab was restored several days later, after the situation was brought to the company’s attention.

The warning screen itself came courtesy of Tencent, the mammoth Chinese internet conglomerate behind WeChat and League of Legends. The company operates the safe browsing filter for Safari users in China on Apple’s behalf — and now, as the Chinese government increasingly asserts control of the territory, in Hong Kong as well.

Apple spokesperson Nadine Haija would not answer questions about the GitLab incident, suggesting they be directed at Tencent, which also declined to offer responses.

The episode raises thorny questions about privatized censorship done in the name of “safety” — questions that neither company seems interested in answering: How does Tencent decide what’s blocked? Does Apple have any role? Does Apple condone Tencent’s blacklist practices?

“They should be responsible to their customers in Hong Kong and need to describe how they will respond to demands from the Chinese authorities to limit access to information,” wrote Charlie Smith, the pseudonymous founder of GreatFire, a Chinese web censorship advocacy and watchdog group. “Presumably people purchase Apple devices because they believe the company when they say that ‘privacy is a fundamental human right’. What they fail to add is *except if you are Chinese.”

Chu tweeted that other Hong Kong residents had reported GitLab similarly blocked on their devices thanks to Tencent. “We will look into it,” Apple engineer Maciej Stachowiak tweeted in response. “Thanks for the heads-up.” But Chu, who also serves as vice president of Internet Society Hong Kong Chapter, an online rights group, said he received no further information from Apple.

The block came as a particular surprise to Chu and other Hong Kong residents because Apple originally said the Tencent blocklist would be used only for Safari users inside mainland China. According to a review of the Internet Archive, however, sometime after November 24, 2022, Apple quietly edited its Safari privacy policy to note that the Tencent blacklist would be used for devices in Hong Kong as well. (Haija, the Apple spokesperson, did not respond when asked when or why Apple expanded the use of Tencent’s filter to Hong Kong.)

Though mainland China has heavily censored internet access for decades, Hong Kong typically enjoyed unfettered access to the web, a freedom only recently threatened by the passage of a sweeping, repressive national security law in 2020.

Silently expanding the scope of the Tencent list not only allows Apple to remain in the good graces of China — whose industrial capacity remains existentially vital to the California-based company — but also provides plausible deniability about how or why such site blocks happen.

“While unfortunately many tech companies proactively apply political and religious censorship to their mainland Chinese users, Apple may be unique among North American tech companies in proactively applying such speech restrictions to users in Hong Kong,” said Jeffrey Knockel, a researcher with Citizen Lab, a digital security watchdog group at the University of Toronto.

Knockel pointed out that while a company like Tencent should expected to comply with Chinese law as a matter of course, Apple has gone out of its way to do so.

“The aspect which we should be surprised by and concerned about is Apple’s decision to work with Tencent in the first place to filter URLs for Apple’s Hong Kong users,” he said, “when other North American tech companies have resisted Hong Kong’s demands to subject Hong Kong users to China-based filtering.”

The block on GitLab would not be the first time Tencent deemed a foreign website “dangerous” for apparently ideological reasons. In 2020, attempts to visit the official website of Notepad++, a text editor app whose French developer had previously issued a statement of solidarity with Hong Kong dissidents, were blocked for users of Tencent web browsers, again citing safety.

The GitLab block also wouldn’t be the first time Apple, which purports to hold deep commitments to human rights, has bent the company’s products to align with Chinese national pressure. In 2019, Apple was caught delisting an app Hong Kong political dissidents were using to organize; in November, users noticed the company had pushed a software update to Chinese iPhone users that significantly weakened the AirDrop feature, which protesters throughout the country had been using to spread messages on the ground.

“All companies have a responsibility to respect human rights, including freedom of expression, no matter where in the world they operate,” Michael Kleinman, head of Amnesty International’s Silicon Valley Initiative, wrote to The Intercept. “Any steps by Apple to limit freedom of expression for internet users in Hong Kong would contravene Apple’s responsibility to respect human rights under the UN Guiding Principles.”

In 2019, Apple publicly acknowledged that it had begun using a “safe browsing” database maintained by Tencent to filter the web activity of its users in China, instead of an equivalent list operated by Google. Safe browsing filters ostensibly protect users from malicious pages containing malware or spear-phishing attacks by checking the website they’re trying to load against a master list of blacklisted domains.

In order to make such a list work, however, at least some personal information needs to be transmitted to the company operating the filter, be it Google or Tencent. When news of Apple’s use of the Tencent safe browsing list first broke, Matthew Green, a professor of cryptography at Johns Hopkins University, described it as “another example of Apple making significant modifications to its privacy infrastructure, largely without publicity or announcement.”

While important questions remain about exactly what information from Safari users in Hong Kong and China is ultimately transmitted to Tencent and beyond, the GitLab incident shows another troubling aspect of safe browsing: It gives a single company the ability to unilaterally censor the web under the aegis of public safety.

“Our concern was that outsourcing this stuff to Chinese firms seemed problematic for Apple,” Green explained in an interview with The Intercept, “and I suppose the nature of having a ‘misinformation’ category is that China is going to have its own views on what that means.”

Indeed, it’s impossible to know in what sense GitLab could have possibly been considered a source of dangerous “unverified information.” The site is essentially an empty vessel where software developers, including corporate clients like T-Mobile and Goldman Sachs, can safely store and edit code. The Chinese government has recently cracked down on some open-source code sites similar to GitLab, where engineers from around the world are able to freely interact, collaborate, and share information. (GitLab did not respond to a request for comment.)

Notably, the censorship-evasion and anonymity web browser Tor has turned to GitLab to catalog instances of Chinese state internet censorship, though there’s no indication it was this activity that led to GitLab’s addition to the Tencent list.

While Tencent provides some public explanation of its criteria for blocking a website, its decision-making process is completely opaque, and the published censorship standards are extremely vague, including offenses like “endangering national security” and “undermining national unity.”

Tencent has long been scrutinized for its ties to the Chinese government, which frequently leverages state power to more closely influence or outright control nominally private firms.

Earlier this month, the Financial Times reported that the Chinese government was acquiring so-called golden shares of Tencent, a privileged form of equity that’s become “a common tool used by the state to exert influence over private news and content companies.” A 2021 New York Times report on Tencent noted the company’s eagerness to cooperate with Chinese government mandates, quoting the company’s president during an earnings call that year: “Now I think it’s important for us to understand even more about what the government is concerned about, what the society is concerned about, and be even more compliant.”

While Tencent’s compliance with the Chinese national security agenda ought not to come as a surprise, Knockel of Citizen Lab says Apple’s should.

“Ultimately I don’t think it really matters exactly how GitLab came to be blocked by Tencent’s Safe Browsing,” he said. “Tencent’s blocking of GitLab for Safari users underscores that Apple’s subjection of Hong Kong users to screening via a China-based company is problematic not only in principle but also in practice.”

Iran lifts its ban on imports of new iPhone models in place since last year,"TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iranians will soon be able to get their hands on iPhones 14, 15 and 16 after authorities lifted a ban on new smartphone models by the U.S. tech giant Apple, according to an announcement Wednesday.

The ban on new iPhone models had been in place since 2023 but now, the country’s telecommunications minister said authorities are allowing the registration of the new models.

The minister, Satar Hashemi, said on X that the problem of registering new iPhone models on the Iranian market was “solved” and that Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian backed the efforts of the communication ministry toward that goal.

Hashemi did not elaborate but said the import measures would be announced, soon.

Following the 2023 ban, iPhone 13 and older versions could still be imported amid high demand for an item that remains a status symbol for many young Iranians.

While the ban was in place, any iPhone 14, 15 or a newer model brought into Iran would stop working on Iran’s state-controlled mobile phone networks after one month, the time span for tourists allowed to visit the county.

The ban spurred a parallel economy for the older handsets, jacking up prices for the devices as many sought to put their depreciating Iranian rials into any physical commodity. It was a sign of the economic woes plaguing Iran after decades of Western sanctions.

Imports of iPhones have long been a contentious point — government statistics suggest that about a third of Iran’s entire $4.4 billion mobile phone import market consisted of iPhones before the ban.

Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in 2020 pointedly criticized iPhone imports though he had previously slammed what he described as all American luxury goods.

“Excessive imports are something dangerous,” Khamenei said at the time, according to a transcript on his official website. “Sometimes this import is a luxury product, meaning there is no need for it. I’ve heard about half a billion dollars were spent to import one type of American luxury cellphone.”

However, other foreign smartphone brands such as Motorola, Samsung, Nokia, Xiaomi and Huawei remain widely available in Iran.",Associated Press News,https://apnews.com/article/iran-apple-iphone-ban-204e7f648fd47ef128cc4c2d70d442d7,2024-10-30 08:06:11+00:00

Netflix co-CEO says the app isn't on Apple's Vision Pro because it isn't worth their time yet,"Netflix wants to see if Apple's new Vision Pro headset catches on before developing an app for it.

Netflix's co-CEO said the product's audience is so small right now that it's not worth the effort.

Pre-orders for the Vision Pro began Jan. 19, and one analyst believes demand may be tough to sustain.

Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters isn't sold on Apple's Vision Pro yet.

Peters, in an interview on Stratechery's ""Daily Update"" podcast, said the decision not to launch a dedicated app for Apple's new Vision Pro headset was ""not by any unwillingness or lack of desire."" Rather, the streaming giant concluded that integrating an app for the $3,500 mixed-reality device simply wasn't worth the resources at this point.

""We have to be careful about making sure that we're not investing in places that are not really yielding a return,"" he said. ""I would say we'll see where things go with Vision Pro.""

Peters said Netflix concluded that its main audience would not substantially ""benefit"" from a dedicated app on the Vision Pro. Instead, users of Apple's new headset will have to watch Netflix through the device's web browser instead.

""Certainly we're always in discussions with Apple to try and figure that out but right now, the device is so subscale that it's not really particularly relevant to most of our members,"" he said.

His comments speak to deeper concerns surrounding the Vision Pro, which is set to launch next Friday. Despite interest in initial pre-orders extending delivery times by at least a month, prominent Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that demand for the new headset — which he described as a niche product — could taper off substantially.

And while the Vision Pro carries a hefty price tag, consumers may be drawn to cheaper headsets on the market, like the $500 Quest 3 launched by Meta in October.

Netflix and Apple did not immediately return a request for comment ahead of publication.

Peters acknowledged that there is ""always"" the chance that the success of the Vision Pro could change Netflix's decision.

""[Netflix and Apple] have worked together for a long time, we've always had active discussions to how we could help each other out. Sometimes we find a great space of overlap. We can move very, very quickly. Sometimes it takes a little bit longer.""

Disclosure: Mathias Döpfner, CEO of Business Insider's parent company, Axel Springer, is a Netflix board member.

“La Maison” Is a Frothy Portrait of the Rich and Fashionable,"Apple TV+’s soi-disant succession drama may gesture at weighty themes, but it’s soapier—and often more fun—than its prestige counterparts.

The opening minutes of “La Maison,” a new succession drama on Apple TV+, offer up an irresistible depiction of the pride that goeth before a fall. Vincent Ledu (Lambert Wilson), the graying head of a Parisian fashion house that bears his name, is about to receive France’s highest civilian honor, but his grasp of his craft is slipping: a wealthy Korean bride whose patronage he urgently needs is proving resistant to his usual charms. After storming out of their meeting, he runs into his younger brother, Victor (Pierre Deladonchamps), whom he exiled from the firm years ago. “Vincent Ledu descends from Olympus to play salesman,” Victor says coolly. “Precisely,” Vincent replies. “And now I’m heading back up.” A day later, when a video goes viral of Vincent calling his difficult client and her entourage “dog-eating plebes,” he’s dragged back down to earth. Though Vincent wishes to envelop himself in “decorous silence,” he’s afforded no such luxury, least of all by his family, who treasure the century-old Ledu brand as their ancestral birthright and their cash cow. A stilted apology, scripted by his P.R. team, does little to ameliorate the crisis. The fashion industry is no stranger to scandal or to racism—as one onlooker puts it, “Ledu just pulled a Galliano”—but Vincent’s offense is immediately deemed fatal. The company’s continuation depends on whether the dynasty can expand its idea of family quickly enough to survive.

“La Maison” is more diversion than art, but what diversion. The ensemble soap is as bitchy and as backstabby as you could hope for, replete with bons mots and campy self-importance: Vincent’s spoiled thirtysomething nephew, Robinson (Antoine Reinartz), a runt within the family but a princeling at the atelier, refers to a subordinate called Céline by another moniker because he refuses to speak the name of the rival brand. Perhaps even more pertinent to its appeal, the series is ravishing to behold—the first of Apple’s fashion-related projects to merit the extravagant budget. And yet for all the Ledus’ jaunts to the Swiss mountainside or to their private island (where, naturally, Vincent and his siblings mope around in their childhood castle), they are the underdogs of this story. Their independence as a maison is threatened by Diane Rovel (Carole Bouquet), a luxury tycoon who prides herself on being the wealthiest woman in Europe but still dwells on what she doesn’t have. The owner of an Arnault-like constellation of labels, she has schemed for decades to add Ledu to her collection, and she senses that this may be her chance.

Don’t mistake “La Maison” for a beau-monde “Succession.” The French series, rather than insisting on the stakes of its inheritance drama, treats the conceit as a wicked game of musical chairs. It mattered who ran the Roys’ conservative media conglomerate; “La Maison,” to its credit, never makes such a case about the fate of a fashion house. Robinson compares his plight to that of “Diana, Fergie, and Meghan”—whom he calls “my girls”—and the show’s pleasures lie in royal-gawking of a sort, hewing more to the restrained elegance of “The Crown” than to the gaudy fantasy of “Emily in Paris.” It’s something of a relief, too, that “La Maison” is twisty without being cynical, free of the bleakness of its HBO predecessor. With the latter, one always got the feeling that, in any of the Roy children’s hands, the family’s empire would instantly collapse; their father was right to withhold the keys to the kingdom. In contrast, there are probably multiple paths to the reinvention of Ledu.

Enter Paloma Castel (Zita Hanrot), an upstart designer who joins the company as a way to learn about her father—the love of Vincent’s life—who died when she was two. (Satisfyingly, her origins are more complicated than they first appear.) The closest thing Vincent has to a scion of his own, the orphaned Paloma can be written into the family mythology (i.e., its rebrand campaign) with some careful finessing. And, as Vincent’s second-in-command, Perle (Amira Casar), points out matter-of-factly, in addition to being a generational talent, Paloma is “a biracial activist woman . . . the essence of everything we need now.” Vincent bristles at her invocation of le wokisme. His preferred candidate is Robinson, precisely because he’s less of a threat in the long term. Wait out the outrage cycle, Vincent believes, and he can retake the throne after the current occupant embarrasses himself. Never mind that Vincent has been repeating ideas for years—that the black gowns that have become Ledu’s signature may as well be funeral shrouds.

Paloma is at once Ledu’s surest bet and its riskiest gamble; when she débuts her first handbag for the house, she finds that her exacting ethical standards actually invite harsher scrutiny. Anyway, she’s more a conduit for debates roiling the industry—over diversity, sustainability, cancel culture—than a believable character in her own right. Previously the head of a Berlin-based label that traffics in unpolished designs and even less polished lefty messaging, Paloma is, frankly, a preposterous choice to run the high-end Ledu: her pants are sewn together from scraps of other pants, her shirts from those of other shirts, and her ideals are no more original. She rails against luxury firms stoking and exploiting “the frustration of people who don’t have money”—then expresses, in the next breath, a near-exclusive interest in haute couture.

Such a disconnect is revealing of larger issues: for every knowing wink at a Dolce & Gabbana stumble or the fabled genesis of the Birkin bag, there’s a detail that feels off, especially when it comes to the characters of color. The Korean client whom Vincent rages against, for example, likely wouldn’t need a translator to converse with the English-fluent designer; nor would an insider like Paloma be surprised that the Ledu enterprise is propped up—like almost all major luxury houses—by the sale of purses and perfume.

But, if “La Maison” occasionally falters on the runway, it is sure-footed as a study of the rich cannibalizing their own. That two fiefdoms are in play—Rovel and Ledu—adds to the sense of glamorous disarray. The wavy-maned, aristocratic Vincent, who looks like an even more dashing Yves Saint Laurent, is a howling lion done in by what he considers a mere thorn in his paw; the nouveau-riche Diane, who’s rarely seen without her achingly heavy gold jewelry, is a tigress slow to realize that the daughter she bats around for sport is growing into a predator to be reckoned with. The dysfunctional dynasties make a fascinating contrast; every unhappy fashion house, it seems, is unhappy in its own way. While Vincent has pointedly refused to cultivate a successor—and stunted once promising candidates like Robinson—Diane veers to the opposite extreme, pitting several potential heirs against one another so that only the most cold-blooded will emerge triumphant. The Rovel mogul’s baroque backstory epitomizes the series’ penchant for corny melodrama, but the character emerges, thanks in part to Bouquet’s grounded performance, as a woman who broke the mold for herself and simply can’t respect anyone incapable of doing the same. Thus Diane joins the pantheon of abysmal parents in prestige (and prestige-aspirant) dramas, expressing perennial disappointment in her daughter even as she forces her to compete against both her husband and her own child. Robinson’s self-sacrificing mother, meanwhile, is dismissed as “a woman who builds her own cage.”

Robinson himself reflects that his proximity to his famous uncle means that he’s seldom seen as anything more than an “opportunity” by the people around him—and yet he can’t help replicating the cutting hauteur with which his older relatives have whittled him down all his life. His ambition of becoming a designer was snuffed out early, such that the Ledu name is all he has to offer. Without the temerity to stand on his own, his pedigree is unlikely to be worth much. But a family pathology is a kind of inheritance, too. ♦",The New Yorker,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/09/30/la-maison-tv-review-apple-tv,2024-09-20 06:00:00-04:00
"Apple 24-inch iMac (2024): Specs, Release Date, Price, Features","It might look the same, but this all-in-one computer supports Apple Intelligence and can be upgraded to sport the company's nano-texture glass for less glare.

Apple overhauled its iMac back in 2021, but since then, the company has been refreshing this all-in-one computer with new processors and not much else. This year, that's more or less the case, except there are a few small welcome additions to the latest M4-powered iMac.

Just like the iPad Mini two weeks ago, Apple announced the 2024 iMac through its online newsroom. The 24-inch desktop computer packs the latest M4 chipset—the newest processor in Apple's M-series lineup. Like other Macs powered by its Apple silicon, the M4 supports Apple Intelligence, the company's artificial intelligence features, now available with macOS Sequoia 15.1.

Starting at $1,299 for the base model, the M4-powered iMac looks the same as its predecessors—but with fun new shades and USB-C versions of its peripherals (finally). The major upgrades are internal though, including a new processor and increased memory to power those Apple Intelligence features more smoothly. It's available for preorder now and ships on November 8.

Another Refresh

It's hard to fault Apple for not changing much about the iMac's design because it still looks great. It sports a 24-inch, 4.5K resolution LCD with a 1080p camera (still a 60-Hz refresh rate). It has a six-speaker sound system and three “studio-quality” microphones. The port selection depends on the configuration. On the base model, you'll now get two Thunderbolt 4 ports while the pricier versions come with four Thunderbolt 4 ports (in addition to a Gigabit Ethernet port). Apple has also added Center Stage to the 12-megapixel webcam, which will automatically keep your face in the frame during video calls.

The colors are technically the same as before (green, yellow, orange, pink, purple, and blue, alongside silver), but rather than pastel shades, Apple made them darker. It comes with color-matched accessories too.

Speaking of, Apple finally transitioned the peripherals to USB-C—so, we can take them off the list of products that still use the Lightning Connector. At checkout, you can pick between the standard Magic Keyboard or the Touch ID model as well as either a Magic Mouse or Magic Trackpad. Yes, the Magic Mouse's charging port is still located at the bottom, so you can't charge and use it at the same time.

Apple has finally added the nano-texture glass option from its Studio Display and Pro Display XDR. It's great if your computer is by a window and you want to reduce glare. However, it's an additional $200 and is only available on the higher-tier iMac configurations.

Powering the 24-inch iMac is an M4 processor. The latest chip was announced in May but until now it was only available in the iPad Pro (2024). Built on a second-generation three-nanometer process, it prioritizes power efficiency and speed. With this new chip, Apple claims the iMac is up to 1.7 times faster than the original M1 chip in the 2021 iMac. Meanwhile, graphics are up to 2.1 times faster. The company also says it's up to six times faster than the aging Intel iMac.

You can also pick between different variations of the M4. If you don't need all the processing power, the entry-level model has an eight-core CPU and an eight-core GPU. You can upgrade to a 10-core CPU and a 10-core GPU. All models start with 16 GB of RAM instead of 8 GB, with the option to go up to 32 GB (depending on the processor). As for storage, you can upgrade up to 2 terabytes for an additional cost, but you start with 256 GB.

The increase in RAM will allow for a smoother experience with Apple Intelligence (it's why Apple increased RAM to 8 GB on the iPhone 16 models). Available with macOS Sequoia 15.1, you'll have access to features like Writing Tools, an overhauled Siri, Summaries for transcriptions in the Notes app, Smart Reply in Messages, and more. You can read all about these features, along with all the other new additions in Sequoia, in our roundup.

Apple Intelligence isn't exclusive to the M4, but it's clear that Apple is on a crusade to update all of its hardware so that Apple Intelligence is at the forefront of its operating systems. As Bloomberg's Mark Gurman pointed out in his Power On newsletter, it took Apple three years to update the iMac with an M3 chip—the company launched the M4 version in 12 months.

Still, like the M3 iMac, the latest model is largely another spec bump. If you have a recent iMac—even the one from 2021—you can at the very least upgrade to the USB-C peripherals separately if you don't need the bump in performance but want to finally ditch those Lightning accessories.",Wired,https://www.wired.com/story/apple-imac-24-inch-2024/,2024-10-28 11:41:59.339000-04:00
Clarice Lispector’s Cosmology,"To understand the philosophical dimensions of her fiction you must read her 1961 novel The Apple in the Dark.

Like dangerous talismans, Clarice Lispector’s novels stage unholy communions—between human and cockroach, reason and madness—that plunge readers further and further into “the incommunicable kingdoms of spirit.” Born in Ukraine, but forced to flee with her family to Brazil at age 12, Lispector—born Chaya Pinkhasivna Lispector—is now a beacon of global modernism. Yet more than a decade into the revival of her work, which comprises nearly 20 novels, short stories, and even children’s books, she continues to defy interpretation. What makes her work sui generis—incomprehensible, inscrutable, and compulsively rereadable—is its chief contradiction: Instead of exalting the inner life, like most works of modernism, her work evacuates it.

That project has captured readers since Near to the Wild Heart (1943) established Lispector as a literary force at age 23. Yet the middle of her literary career has largely escaped notice. The publication of The Apple in the Dark (1961)—translated into English from Portuguese by her biographer, Benjamin Moser—addresses that lacuna. The novel does not scaffold Lispector’s later novels so much as provide their most maximal, and most human, expression. It may not tremor with as much energy as her other work, but its place in her bibliography captures a vital artistic interregnum. Between her precocious early hits and her signature late style is the novel that would gestate a key axiom of Lispector’s project: Progress of any kind—literary, spiritual, personal—is equivalent to paring down, curbing excess, and pursuing the most elegant shape of a form. Ironically, it is this novel, her longest, that makes that point.

Unlike its offspring in The Passion According to G.H. (1964) and Água Viva (1973), The Apple in the Dark reveals the source of Lispector’s lifelong quest for the primordial. Its epigraph hails from the Upanishads, a series of oral inquiries into the origins of consciousness transmitted across several centuries BCE in South Asia. That is why, in part, she called this novel “the best one”—it is the most transparent about the philosophical journey that her later fictions repeatedly traverse: getting over yourself. It does so by jettisoning the façade of the social, and even the “authentic” self, for the timeless one of Brahman—that is, God. Of course, The Apple in the Dark is not the first work of modernism to draw upon ancient Indian philosophy. T.S. Eliot’s The Wasteland is well-known for the Upanishadic Sanskrit of its last lines—“shantih, shantih, shantih”—and the likes of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Ernst Cassirer, Arthur Schopenhauer, Leo Tolstoy, Simone Weil, Walt Whitman, and W.B. Yeats were equally drawn to its cosmology.

While ancient Indian philosophy invigorates the work of these writers and thinkers, at times, during its historical and cultural voyages, it has fallen into less ethical hands. Infamously, Nazi Indologists justified genocide through the Bhagavad Gita. More commonly, these texts have simply endured cultural misunderstandings. In Occidentosis (1962), a contemporary of The Apple in the Dark, Jalal Al-e Ahmad mocked the global vogue for Asian philosophy as a form of spiritual dandyism. Inevitably, as ideas travel, texts get used and abused.

But Lispector’s oeuvre is proof of the salutary side of cultural colloquy. Her interest in Indian philosophy reshapes our understanding of her broader novelistic project. Her work has long been framed within the mystical Christian and Jewish traditions of her Ukrainian heritage and Brazilian setting; Moser in fact reads The Apple in the Dark as an allegory of the Kabbalah. But Lispector’s oracular utterances have a source centuries older: the Taittiriya Upanishad, whose invocation of Brahman begins The Apple in the Dark: “By creating all things, he entered into everything. By entering into all things, he became whatever has form and whatever is formless.” The language of the Upanishads seeps into Lispector’s vatic syntax and paradoxical koans—discovering form through the loss of form, passing through what one is not in order to discover what one is, in the true spirit of the philosophical dialectic.

What to make of the revelation of Lispector’s ancient Indian source? Lispector neither transcribes nor updates the Upanishads. Yet she would not have viewed those charges as insults. Her work, after all, avers the novelty of imitation. Despite her famous modesty—“I lack culture and erudition”—the likes of Spinoza and Nietzsche were on the tip of her tongue. The importance of these sources to Lispector reshapes her image as a glamorous, self-taught mystic, nudging readers instead toward the philosophical substance of her characters’ quests for truth. Viewed this way, Lispector’s work sheds light, old and new, onto a perennial inquiry into our mental luminosity—and into the surprising politics that follow.

Lispector wrote The Apple in the Dark over a decade, apparently while listening to Brahms’s Symphony No. 4 on repeat. “I remember very much the pleasure I felt writing The Apple in the Dark,” she said, according to her son, in a passage that mimics the earnest style of her characters. “Every morning I typed. I copied it eleven times to find out what I was trying to say, because I want to say something and I still don’t know for sure what. By copying I will understand myself.” Lispector finished the novel in Washington, DC, where she was living with her then-husband, a diplomat. There, she appears to have come across the work of Swami Prabhavananda and Frederick Manchester, whose English translation of the Upanishads provides the novel’s epigraph.

Unlike in Lispector’s subsequent fiction, which practically emerges from the ethereal realm of the symbol, The Apple in the Dark’s dramatis personae are somewhat more fleshed out. The plot kicks off when the protagonist, Martim, arrives at a ranch shared by two relatives, Vitória and Ermelinda. The presence of multiple characters is noteworthy in terms of Lispector’s oeuvre, but the three are best understood as a collective. Their dialogues often devolve into existential monologues. A third-person narrator, in lieu of Lispector’s typically tormented “I,” helps readers keep track of their flirtations and ruminations, which are born out of a shared sense of desperation.

Vitória and Ermelinda have made tragic bargains with life, avoiding trouble by asking for little, while Martim is on the run after supposedly murdering his wife in a crime of passion. But as the doubts into his mental state grow, we learn that his wife “hadn’t even died.” Martim’s crime—cryptically and frequently alluded to without much explanation—becomes less literal and more metaphorical over the course of the novel: As he reckons with a murder he did not actually succeed in committing, Martim does kill off his own ego.

This process takes place in three stages that correspond to the novel’s three parts. Part I, “How a man is made,” is a loose metaphysical meditation spurred by Martim’s attempted crime. Part II, “Birth of a hero,” empties Martim’s individuality into the whole of humanity. Part III, “The apple in the dark,” concludes his journey. Once the inward-looking protagonist of his own life, then the product of his philosophical dialogues with Ermelinda and Vitória, Martim, in the novel’s final act, realizes that an apple can simply sit in the dark, irrespective of our conscious awareness of it. In other words, he grasps his insignificance in a world that exists independently of him.

The journey outlined by the novel’s three parts tracks the journey of its characters toward the fundamental source of consciousness. That is the explicit reason Lispector gives for writing: “I want the thing itself.” The phrase is not mystical; it is a citation of Kant, perhaps by way of Virginia Woolf: “But there is no Shakespeare, there is no Beethoven; certainly and emphatically there is no God; we are the words; we are the music; we are the thing itself.” Lispector is after the Kantian noumenal, the Woolfian moment of being, or the Upanishadic Brahman—the timeless unity of consciousness that makes possible the world’s diversity, regardless of what you call it.

But when Lispector’s characters seek out this primordial “thing itself,” they don’t remain there. They come back to the world, ready to change it. Martim’s journey emphasizes that return leg. During a stay at the ranch, he begins to question the social codes that have led him to life as a fugitive. Dissatisfied with what passes for conventional wisdom—upheld by another invisible force, capitalism—he experiences a vision:

Suddenly it really did seem to Martim that until now he’d been traveling down superimposed paths. And that his true and invisible journey had really been made beneath the path he thought he’d been walking along. And that the true journey was now emerging suddenly into the light as from a tunnel.

Lispector would explain this insight in The Passion According to G.H.: “The gradual deheroization of oneself is the true labor one works at beneath the apparent labor.” But in The Apple in the Dark, looking inward instead of outward—in order to view both directions with lucidity—tames Martim’s tantrums. Just as G.H. lowered herself to the level of a cockroach, receiving it like a host, Martim humbles himself before the hapless Vitória, kneeling before her and inspiring her to reciprocate the gesture.

Their symbolic expression of equality produces a sense of unity. “More and more he was feeling himself to be other people,” the narrator exults. “He had reached an impersonality inside himself: he had been so deeply himself, that he had become the ‘himself.’” Martim peels back the false layers of the outer self to enter our shared humanity. In this way, he realizes the novel’s Upanishadic message, etched in its epigraph: “He became all manner of things: that is why the wise men call him the real one.”

If Martim realizes that his self (atman) is merely an expression of Brahman—that his individual consciousness is but a fraction of the universal mind to which it is identical—his author reaches the same insight: “I am Martim,” Lispector once admitted. This spiritual revelation begets a more surprising political one: “In private,” according to Lispector’s son, “she always described herself as a democratic socialist.”

How does spiritualism lead to socialism? In her work, Lispector nudges her characters toward “the delicate work” of “being objective.” Newly cognizant of how they perceive the world, they begin a quest to see reality clearly. What they behold often isn’t pretty. When Martim describes “the world undone by a crime,” he may as well be referring to the crimes of capitalism itself. The notion that Martim “could re-erect, give a meaning and set up once again,” suggests less a physical or metaphysical re-creation of the earth than the possibility of an egalitarian future.

This interpretation is not that far-fetched. Throughout her life, Lispector asked how—if at all—literature could represent or even reduce economic equality in Brazil; she originally studied law to aid in prison reform. But her fiction arguably provides the immaterial foundation for material uplift, not through agitprop but through conceptual miracles: epiphanies. During her characters’ moments of kairos, they demonstrate how unwitting consumers of capitalist ideology can recognize—and then challenge—its logic of commodity. If an almost-murderer like Martim can flip the mental switch, readers can do it too: “Having at least reached fully himself…[Martim] would reach men,” the narrator proclaims, describing the mimetic effect of her words on the person who reads them.

This movement from self to others, inner life to outer world, and subjectivity to objectivity explains how Lispector’s enlightenment could sustain a socialist program. What compels these awakenings is the novel’s Upanishadic spirit. If her characters realize that there is a common source to us all—humans, animals, plants, consciousness, even “the thing itself”—Indian philosophy becomes less a passing fad or epigraphic decoration. Its unity consciousness instead provides the ballast for political consciousness; its universalism, the bedrock of socialism. Thus, when Lispector’s characters get over themselves, what follows isn’t simply inner peace, blithe indifference to the world, or superficial curiosity about others. Instead, they view themselves as fundamentally the same substance as others: materially, economically, ecologically, spiritually, and, in the case of Martim, even literally.",The Nation,https://www.thenation.com/article/culture/clarice-lispector-apple-dark/,2024-07-24 09:00:00+00:00
‘There is no life’ after Oct 7: An Israeli mother grapples with grief one year after Hamas’ devastating attack,"Sigal Shemer headed to the cemetery in Lod, a city in central Israel, in late September to wash her son’s headstone and place flowers on his grave.

Ron, her eldest son, was murdered by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7, 2023, after the militant group launched an early morning attack on southern Israel, killing roughly 1,200 people and taking more than 250 as hostages, according to estimates from Israeli authorities.

Numbers compiled by Fox News indicate an estimated 101 hostages are still being held in Gaza, almost 365 days later, including seven Americans.

Sigal reflected on the death of her son and the enduring impact of Oct. 7, one year later, in an interview with Fox News Digital.

Trauma has reshaped her life and left an indelible mark on her family, but she’s found some solace and hope through the Jerusalem-based nonprofit OneFamily, which offers support and resources to victims of terror. Through community outreach, the organization has become a lifeline, helping her navigate the complexities of her sorrow while honoring her son’s memory, amid a background of ongoing violence and loss.

Ron had been attending the Nova music festival in Re'im when the carnage unfolded, running with his friends to a car to escape the sound of gunshots in the area and the horror that was beginning to take place.

But the 23-year-old didn’t want to leave without two of his close friends. He opted not to get into the car and instead went to look for Dan and Omar. Soon after he found them, the trio went inside a shelter not far from the festival.

""He told to a friend, 'Don't be afraid. I will attack if someone will come in. I will attack them, and I will take care of you.' But the terrorists dropped three grenades into the shelter,"" his mother told Fox News Digital.

Dan was killed, Omar survived and Ron was taken outside, where he was heard fighting and struggling with Hamas militants. He wasn’t heard from for days and his family feared he had been taken hostage.

""One week after, there was a knock on the door, and they told us — the army and the police told us — that Ron is... is not... is not alive because they shot him in the head,"" Sigal said.

She took a moment to remove her glasses and wipe away the tears from her eyes. The death of her son is still palpable and raw for the mother of two, who is survived by her husband Oren, and younger son Bari.

Sigal remembered Ron as a young man who loved people and animals, loved to travel and loved to help others.

He was a counselor at a Jewish youth summer camp in Pennsylvania, where he taught children Muay Thai, a form of boxing and the national sport of Thailand.

Since his murder, the Shemer family has returned to the camp, meeting with those who knew Ron and visiting all of his favorite places in the United States.

Before Oct. 7, Ron was on a 10-month trip to South America and Sigal feared for his safety.

""All the time, I was afraid that something will happen to him because it's, you know, in Brazil, the Amazonas, Colombia — places that — they're not so safe. And I tell him, please come home, please come home. It's not safe there. So, he came home and it's not safe here. It's not safe to be here,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""The terrorists, the monster… came inside the country and killed and murdered and raped and burned a lot of people, innocent people.""

""There is no life. I think there is no life. There is no life from the 7th of October,"" she added.

Sigal was working as an event producer prior to the day that’s now known as ""Black Saturday."" She’s since left her job, consumed by grief, and now works two days a week taking care of dogs, something her son loved to do.

""I want people to know that my son and all of the murdered boys and girls on the 7th of October are lost for the world,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""Many people in Israel lost their sons and daughters for nothing. Just for nothing.""

OneFamily Fund has provided support to many families whose loved ones were murdered in the worst attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust.

Naomi Nussbaum, OneFamily’s executive director, told Fox News Digital how they use different types of therapy to help families cope with the loss of a loved one.

""We offer three types of support: Emotional support, financial support and legal aid. We've given out much, much more financial aid now than before because of the kind of devastation, you know, the nature of the attack on October 7th,"" she said.

""There's traditional therapy with psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, trauma-informed therapists tackling PTSD throughout all the categories. Dealing with PTSD is the most insidious and difficult part of the terror attacks to deal with. Then, we have the social network, which is really the heart and soul of OneFamily.""

Sigal has met with other mothers whose children were murdered and said it’s not an easy thing to do, but it’s helpful to speak with someone who’s suffering from a similar situation and going through the same stages of grief.

""We're like professional friends for life. And the other people in the group that we put her with will be there also. You know, she can call anybody at any time to have dinner or to go for a walk or for a birthday or the anniversary of a death. They'll be there for each other forever,"" said Nussbaum.

""It takes a lot of courage and strength to smile again for the first time or to take a little bit of joy to say, let's go out to dinner tonight. Sometimes, the guilt and the grief and bereavement is too strong, and people can't do that. So, OneFamily, really with open arms and a lot of love, does everything they can to get them to want to come back to life again.""

A State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital in Israel’s nearly 12-month-long war against Hamas, more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed, including more than 6,200 women and 11,300 children.

The Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count.

Nearly 2 million people are estimated to have been displaced in Gaza – about 90% of the population, according to the United Nations, and 495,000 people are facing catastrophic levels of food insecurity.",Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/media/there-no-life-after-oct-7-israeli-mother-grapples-grief-one-year-after-hamas-devastating-attack,2024-10-06 07:00:07-04:00
Apple embraces AI craze with newly unleashed iPhone 16 lineup ,"Apple on Monday charged into the artificial intelligence craze with a new iPhone lineup that marks the company's latest attempt to latch onto a technology trend and transform it into a cultural phenomenon.

The four different iPhone 16 models will all come equipped with special chips needed to power a suite of AI tools that Apple hopes will make its marquee product even more indispensable and reverse a recent sales slump.

Apple's AI features are designed to turn its often-blundering virtual assistant Siri into a smarter and more versatile sidekick, automate a wide range of tedious tasks, and pull off other crowd-pleasing tricks such as creating customized emojis within seconds.

After receiving a standing ovation for Monday's event, Apple CEO Tim Cook promised the AI package would unleash ""innovations that will make a true difference in people's lives.""

But the breakthroughs won't begin as soon as the new iPhones — ranging in price from $800 to $1,200 — hit the stores on September 20.

Most of Apple's AI functions will roll out as part of a free software update to iOS 18, the operating system that will power the iPhone 16 rolling out from October through December. U.S. English will be the featured language at launch, but an update enabling other languages will come out next year, according to Apple.

It's all part of a new approach that Apple previewed at a developers conference three months ago to create more anticipation for a next generation of iPhones amid a rare sales slump for the well-known devices.

Since Apple's June conference, competitors such as Samsung and Google have made greater strides in AI — a technology widely expected to trigger the most dramatic changes in computing since the first iPhone came out 17 years ago.

Just as Apple elevated fledgling smartphones into a must-have technology in 21st-century society, the Cupertino, California, company is betting it can do something similar with its tardy arrival to artificial intelligence.

'Apple Intelligence'

To set itself apart from the early leaders in AI, the technology being baked into the iPhone 16 is being promoted as ""Apple Intelligence."" Despite the unique branding, Apple's new approach mimics many of the features already available in the Samsung Galaxy S24 released in January and the Google Pixel 9 that came out last month.

""Apple could have waited another year for further development, but initial take up of AI- powered devices from the likes of Samsung has been encouraging, and Apple is keen to capitalize on this market,"" said PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore.

As it treads into new territory, Apple is trying to preserve its longtime commitment to privacy by tailoring its AI so that most of its technological tricks can be processed on the device itself instead of relying on giant banks of computers located in remote data centers. When a task needs to connect to a data center, Apple promises it will be done in a tightly controlled way that ensures that no personal data is stored remotely.

While corralling the personal information shared through Apple's AI tools inherently reduces the chances that the data will be exploited or misused against a user's wishes, it doesn't guarantee iron-clad security. A device could still be stolen, for instance, or hacked through digital chicanery.

For users seeking to access even more AI tools than being offered by the iPhone, Apple is teaming up with OpenAI to give users the option of farming out more complicated tasks to the popular ChatGPT chatbot.

Although Apple is releasing a free version of its operating system to propel its on-device AI features, the chip needed to run the technology is only available on the iPhone 16 lineup and the high-end iPhone 15 models that came out a year ago.

That means most consumers who are interested in taking advantage of Apple's approach to AI will have to buy one of the iPhone 16 models – a twist that investors are counting on will fuel a surge in demand heading into the holiday season.

The anticipated sales boom is the main reason Apple's stock price has climbed by more than 10%, including a slight uptick Monday after the shares initially slipped following the showcase for the latest iPhones.

Besides its latest iPhones, Apple also introduced a new version of its smartwatch that will include a feature to help detect sleep apnea as well the next generation of its wireless headphones, the AirPods Pro, that will be able to function as a hearing aid with an upcoming software update.",Voice Of America,https://www.voanews.com/a/apple-embraces-ai-craze-with-newly-unleashed-iphone-16-lineup-/7777694.html,2024-09-09 22:48:00+00:00
Using your Apple Watch to monitor blood pressure,"Regular monitoring of blood pressure is essential for maintaining heart health, especially for those with hypertension or concerns about high blood pressure.

With the advent of technology, checking blood pressure has become easier and more accessible, particularly through devices like the Apple Watch.

Let’s explore how to use your Apple Watch to monitor your blood pressure.

Monitoring blood pressure at home allows you to track their readings over time, providing valuable insights into their health. This practice can help identify trends, manage medications and understand how lifestyle factors such as diet and stress affect blood pressure levels. Regular logs can serve as benchmarks for what is considered a healthy range for each individual.

While the Apple Watch itself cannot measure blood pressure directly, it can be paired with compatible blood pressure monitors. These devices typically consist of an arm cuff and a wireless connection to the Apple Watch, allowing you to sync your readings with the Health app. This integration makes it easy to keep track of blood pressure data alongside other health metrics.

Several blood pressure monitors are designed to work seamlessly with the Apple Watch, offering features such as Bluetooth connectivity, data storage and integration with health apps. Check out our three recommended blood pressure monitors that work seamlessly with the Apple Watch.

Using a compatible device like the OMRON Platinum Blood Pressure Monitor, follow these steps:

Incorporating blood pressure monitoring into your daily routine can significantly contribute to better heart health. While the Apple Watch cannot measure blood pressure on its own, its compatibility with various monitors makes it a powerful tool for health management. By regularly checking your blood pressure and making necessary lifestyle adjustments, you can take proactive steps toward maintaining a healthy heart.

Best Apple AirTags Sale 2024: $20 AirTag Trackers Amazon Deal Discount,"While AirTags are still $29 on the Apple website, you can get the trackers discounted on Amazon right now for the lowest price since the spring

Few things are as annoying as misplacing your phone or wallet, especially if you’re in a rush to leave the house. Our travel fear, meantime? Losing your luggage at the airport. But the days of digging under couches and searching for bags and jackets are over, thanks to Apple‘s AirTag tracking devices.

The popular coin-sized trackers are on sale on Amazon right now for just $79.99 (for a four-pack), bringing the price of each individual AirTag down to under $20 each. Compare that to Apple.com, where AirTags start at $29 for a single tracker, and you’re basically saving yourself a decent amount of dough.

Amazon also has the individual AirTags on sale for $24 (normally $29), but the trick to scoring the biggest AirTags discount is to pick up the four pack for $79.99. That brings the price of each AirTag down to just $20, which is the cheapest price we’ve seen since the spring.

AirTags are quickly becoming a must-have accessory to help people keep track of their stuff, especially when commuting or traveling. The portable trackers measure just over an inch in diameter and weigh just 11 grams, making them super lightweight and easy to hide. They’re an essential travel accessory to help track your bags after checking them in, and they’re great for students who are prone to misplacing their backpacks or laptop cases too.

Don’t just take our word for it though: Amazon says more than 10,000 people have purchased AirTags in the last month alone, with almost 90% of shoppers giving the trackers a full, five-star review.

Tracking your items with AirTags is simple: the AirTags use Ultra Wideband technology to quickly identify and find your items nearby. If your items are further away, the AirTags tap into Apple’s “Find My” network, which many people already use for the “Find My Phone” feature. Simply connect to the “Find My” app on your phone or tablet, pair the app with your AirTag and instantly see where you stuff is. Apple says all communication with the network is anonymous and encrypted for privacy, and your location data and history are never stored on the AirTag or Cloud.

Each AirTag comes with a replaceable battery that lasts for more than a year, and the trackers are rated IP67 for dust and water-resistance too (they can be under up to a meter of water for 30 minutes or less without damage or losing connectivity).

Aside from travel, we stick AirTags on everything from our everyday carry (think wallets, keys, phone, etc.) to our coats and jackets. You can even attach an AirTag to a pet collar, to keep track of your furry friends. While we simply put an AirTag in our bags and clothing, you can also grab an AirTag holder or keychain to keep the tiny devices more secure.

Apple products almost never go on sale and the AirTags have not been marked down since they launched last spring. As of this writing, the AirTags price is still $29 on Apple.com and a four-pack would cost almost $120. This AirTag sale on Amazon brings the four-pack down to just $79.99.

Amazon’s best AirTag deal sold out quickly last year, and this sale won’t last long so we recommend adding to cart soon. See full details here.",Rolling Stone,https://www.rollingstone.com/product-recommendations/electronics/best-apple-airtag-sale-deals-discounts-1293949/,2024-09-30 16:06:00+00:00
Apple lanza actualización para iPhone 16 que incluye por primera vez inteligencia artificial,"Apple lanzó el lunes una actualización de software gratuita que inyectará su primera dosis de inteligencia artificial en su línea iPhone 16, al tiempo que intenta ponerse al día con lo más avanzado de la tecnología.

La actualización del sistema operativo iOS 18 llega más de un mes después que cuatro modelos de iPhone 16 equipados con el chip necesario para las funciones de inteligencia artificial salieran a la venta a precios de entre 800 y 1.200 dólares. Los modelos premium del año pasado, el iPhone 15 Pro y el iPhone 15 Pro Max, también poseen un procesador que habilitará la tecnología de IA una vez que se instale la actualización de software.

Las versiones recientes de iPad y Mac también se pueden actualizar con el software.

Fuera de Estados Unidos, la empresa lanzará un software de IA para sus iPhones hasta el próximo año en una fecha aún por determinar. Apple pasó las últimas cinco semanas probando el software de IA entre usuarios que se inscribieron para ayudar a la compañía a afinar la tecnología.

Se supone que la infusión de IA transformará al asistente virtual de Apple, Siri, en un compañero más conversacional, versátil y colorido, cuya presencia será denotada por una luz brillante que rodeará la pantalla del iPhone a medida que se manejan las solicitudes.

Si bien Apple promete que Siri podrá realizar más tareas y ser menos propensa a confundirse, no podrá interactuar con otras aplicaciones instaladas en el iPhone hasta que salga otra actualización de software en una fecha aún no establecida.

Otras funciones de IA incluidas en esta actualización de software se encargarán de una variedad de tareas de redacción y corrección, resumirán el contenido de los correos electrónicos y otros documentos. La IA también proporcionará herramientas de edición para editar fotos y facilitar la búsqueda de fotos pasadas.

La mayoría de las funciones de inteligencia artificial que Apple presentó el lunes ya están disponibles en los teléfonos con Android que Samsung y Google lanzaron a principios de este año.

Para distinguir su enfoque de los competidores, el conjunto de nuevas tecnologías del iPhone se comercializa como “Apple Intelligence”. Apple también promete que sus funciones de IA harán un trabajo mucho mejor protegiendo la privacidad de los usuarios, ya sea ejecutando la tecnología en el dispositivo o resguardados en un centro de datos similar a una fortaleza cuando algunas solicitudes tengan que procesarse de forma remota.

Debido a que la mayoría de los iPhones que se usan actualmente en todo el mundo no tiene el microprocesador necesario para la IA de Apple, se espera que la tecnología genere una gran demanda de los nuevos modelos durante la temporada navideña y también durante el próximo año. Esa es la razón principal por la que el precio de las acciones de Apple se ha disparado un 18% desde que la empresa de Cupertino, California, presentó su estrategia de IA en una conferencia a principios de junio. Esto ha aumentado el valor de mercado de Apple en unos 500.000 millones de dólares, catapultándola más cerca de convertirse en la primera empresa estadounidense con un valor de 4 billones de dólares.",Associated Press News,https://apnews.com/article/apple-software-inteligencia-ai-iphone-7bf6d9aa404a3090f92541fcf56edfb0,2024-10-28 16:38:14+00:00
Apple is opening up its powerful App Store for the first time ever. It's not happy about it.,"Apple spent years resisting efforts to open up its App Store and other parts of its iOS ecosystem.

Now it's happening — in Europe — because of a new law from EU regulators.

It's a major concession from Apple, which made it clear it's not happy about the change.

For years, Apple has been insistent that it needs control over its App Store and other key parts of its iPhone ecosystem, even in the face of increasing complaints from regulators.

But now, for the first time, it is going to grudgingly open up many of those elements — because of regulatory pressure.

Important to know: The changes Apple announced Thursday only apply in Europe because of a new law that goes into effect in March.

But, they are significant since Apple has spent a lot of time and effort trying to avoid making many of these changes.

Some of the big ones:

Apple will allow developers to create and distribute apps without using the company's App Store.

Apple's App Store now will now take a cut of up to 17%, plus another 3% fee, for payments made on apps distributed on its App Store. That's down from a long-held maximum commission of 30%.

Developers who use a non-Apple store won't have to give Apple any fee at all, except for apps that are downloaded more than a million times a year. Those apps — along with apps distributed through Apple's App Store — will pay a fee of 0.50 euros for each download over a million.

Other key changes include the ability for users to set a default web browser other than Apple's Safari browser. And for developers to use Apple's near-field communication tech, so users can make contactless payments with their phones without using Apple's Apple Pay and Apple Wallet system.

In its language announcing the changes, Apple makes it clear that it thinks many of these things are a bad idea.

""The new options for processing payments and downloading apps on iOS open new avenues for malware, fraud and scams, illicit and harmful content, and other privacy and security threats,"" the company says.

It also says it will try to help customers by offering some kind of buffer between them and outside developers. That includes a system to ""notarize"" all apps, regardless of whether they come from Apple's store or somewhere else, ""focused on platform integrity and protecting users.""

And how this actually rolls out is still to be determined. In part, that's because Apple is still appealing one piece of the new rules' implementation. And in part because of choices both consumers and developers will need to make.

For instance: Users who do want to buy something via a store other than Apple's App Store will encounter this screen, making it very clear that if they hand over their credit card info to someone other than Apple, then Apple won't be able to help them if something bad happens.

If you've used an iPhone app in the last few years, you've seen a similar screen that told you the app's developer would like to track your movement around the web. That screen requires you to actively say you want to do that.

Related stories

Not surprisingly, most people have not opted into that for most apps. And that change has roiled the entire digital advertising industry, including Apple rival Meta. Faced with a warning like that, it may not be surprising to learn that many iPhone users end up sticking around with Apple's system instead of going with an outside developer's store.

And developers with very popular apps will have to figure out what Apple's new fee system means for them.

Of note: Fortnite-maker Epic Games, which directly challenged Apple's App Store rules and got kicked off the platform as a result, says the new regulations mean it will bring Fortnite back to Apple's phones in Europe in 2024. But the company says it will ""continue to argue to the courts and regulators that Apple is breaking the law.""

Will any of this come to the US or anywhere outside Europe? No, Apple says, because ""this is not the safest system for our users."" Translation: If you want us to do this anywhere else, you'll need a new law.

That could come in the future. In the meantime, Thursday's news is a milestone for Apple and regulators: Proof that if pushed hard enough, one of the world's most powerful companies can change things it said it never wanted to change.

MacOS Sequoia, also known as macOS 15, is officially here. The new OS packs a ton of new capabilities onto the desktop, including a password management app, videoconferencing tools, and updates to Safari as well as all the features that come with Apple Intelligence—the company’s new artificial intelligence–powered system. Below, we break down how to download it and all the latest goodies in this software update.

Be sure to check out our iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 roundup for all the new features coming to your iPhone and iPad, and our look at what’s new in watchOS 11.

Updated October 28, 2024: We added details on macOS 15.1, which includes Apple Intelligence.

MacOS Sequoia Features

Below, you'll find all the major features included in macOS 15. Apple has more details here.

Sometimes your iPhone is in the other room or deep in your bag. For those moments when you need to use it but simply don't feel like getting up to find it, you'll be able to pull it up on your computer. As part of Apple's Continuity features, iPhone Mirroring gives you the ability to both access and interact with your iPhone wirelessly using your Mac.

When the feature is in action, you'll see your iPhone's custom home screen appear. From there, you can use the keyboard, trackpad, or mouse to drag and drop content (like photos, videos, and files) between both devices, open and use any of your apps, swipe through all the pages on your home screen, as well as view and respond to notifications. While you're doing all this, your iPhone will remain locked. It also works while your iPhone is in Standby mode, a feature from iOS 17 that turns your iPhone into a smart display while charging.

MacOS Sequoia offers a few new features to Safari. With Highlights, Safari will use machine intelligence to show you relevant information from the webpage like directions, links, summaries, and restaurant reviews. Apple also redesigned the Reader to minimize distractions. In addition to a sleeker view of the article, you'll also see a summary and a table of contents (for longer articles). If the webpage includes a video, Viewer will bring it to the forefront while still giving you access to playback controls (Picture in Picture included).

Those who always keep a ton of browser windows open simultaneously will appreciate the new Window Tiling feature that helps organize them for a better viewing experience. When you drag a window to the edge of the screen, the new OS will automatically suggest a tiled position on your screen. (It's similar to Snap on Windows.) You can then drop the window into place, arrange multiple windows side by side, or place them in any of the four corners to make room for more apps. For quicker organization, you can use keyboard and menu shortcuts too.

Last year, Apple added a ton of new videoconference tools with macOS Sonoma including Presenter Overlay, Reactions, and various features for the Mac's built-in webcam. This year, the company is adding a few more. With apps like FaceTime and Zoom, you'll have access to a new presenter preview capability that allows you to see what you're about to share before actually sharing it. Meanwhile, the built-in backgrounds feature allows you to apply system wallpapers, color gradients, or your own photos as a backdrop for video calls. Apple says this feature will be available on FaceTime and third-party apps like Webex.

If you never loved Keychain, now you have a better option: macOS Sequoia comes with a new Passwords app that allows you to access all your passwords (Wi-Fi passwords included), passkeys, and verification codes in one place. It keeps all your Apple devices in sync, runs on Windows machines (using the iCloud for Windows app) too, and supports end-to-end encryption.

A few new Messages features are coming to macOS Sequoia—and by extension, to iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 as well. You'll be able to format your texts within Messages using bold, italic, underline, and strikethrough type treatments. You'll also have the ability to add animated effects to a specific word within a text. For some phrases and words, you'll also see suggestions appear as you type. Apple added new Tapbacks too—instead of using the traditional heart, thumbs up, thumbs down, question mark, or exclamation point, you'll also see options to use emoji and stickers. Another standout new feature is the option to schedule your messages ahead of time so they'll be sent later.

Apple Intelligence Features

In addition to the features above, Apple Intelligence—the company's “personal intelligence system”—is built into macOS Sequoia as well as iOS 18 and iPadOS 18. These features are only available in Sequoia 15.1, with additional capabilities to come later.

Unfortunately, Apple Intelligence isn't available on all Macs that support macOS 15. You'll need a Mac running the M1 chipset and newer to take advantage of the AI newness. More specifically, this includes:

Here's what Apple Intelligence is capable of.

Apple is introducing Writing Tools, which consists of a few different features that work within Notes, Pages, Mail, and third-party apps. There's Rewrite, which allows you to pick from different versions of what you've written based on several tones; Proofread, which checks word choice, grammar, and sentence structure, while also suggesting edits (along with explanations of the edits) with the option to review or quickly accept; and Summarize, which allows you to select text and have it recapped in a paragraph, list, a table, or bulleted key points.

Image Playground generates playful images based on three different styles: Illustration, Sketch, and Animation. It's available as a dedicated app, but you can also access it through Messages. To generate an image, you can either pick from the available concepts, type a description of what you're looking for, or choose a photo of someone from your photo library. This feature isn't available yet.

If you're a fan of the Memories feature in the Photos app, you'll be excited to know that Apple is making it more customizable. Rather than settling for the automated version, you'll be able to create specific stories you want to see by typing in a description. From there, Apple will pick out the best photos and videos that match the description, create a storyline based on themes associated with the photos, and generate a movie with its own narrative.

Apple also introduced a new Clean Up tool. Similar to Google's Magic Eraser, Clean Up can identify and remove unwanted or distracting objects in the background of the photo without changing the subject.

Notes will now come equipped with the ability to transcribe audio sessions, as well as summarize notes. That way, you don't have to focus on physically taking notes. And, with a new Math Notes feature, you'll also be able to type in an equation and have it solved automatically within the body of the note.

Apple is finally giving Siri a major overhaul. It's been redesigned to speak more naturally, and it's been given the ability to understand context within conversations. So instead of always having to help Siri along by reminding it of what you were asking about in your last question, Siri will simply remember what the topic of the conversation is. This makes conversations feel more personable and easy.

You'll also be able to interact with Siri by typing in your requests instead of speaking them. You can also now move the Siri window around anywhere on your screen. The company integrated OpenAI's ChatGPT (using the GPT-4o model) into Siri as well. If Siri thinks ChatGPT can help answer a question you've posed, it'll hand off the request to OpenAI's chatbot. This feature is coming in iOS 18.2.

There's a new Focus mode called Reduce Interruptions. It uses your personal context to figure out when to hide incoming notifications that could distract you. But if you're worried you might miss something important, you can turn on Intelligent Breakthrough and Silencing, which will send through any critical alerts (like important texts).",Wired,https://www.wired.com/story/apple-macos-sequoia-features/,2024-06-11 17:06:00.283000-04:00
Apple launches the iPhone into the AI era with free software update,"Apple is releasing a free software update that will inject its first dose of artificial intelligence into its iPhone 16 lineup as the trendsetting company tries to catch up with technology’s latest craze.

The upgrade to the iOS 18 operating system on Monday arrives more than a month after four iPhone 16 models equipped with the special computer chip needed to power the AI features went on sale at prices ranging from $800 to $1,200. Last year’s premium models — the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max — also possess a processor that will enable the AI technology after the software update is installed.

Recent versions of Apple’s iPad and Mac computer also can be updated with the software.

Countries outside the U.S. won’t be getting the AI software for their iPhones until next year at a date still to be determined. Apple spent the past five weeks testing the AI software among an audience of iPhone owners who signed up to help the company fine tune the technology.

The AI infusion is supposed to transform Apple’s often bumbling virtual assistant Siri into a more conversational, versatile and colorful companion whose presence will be denoted by a glowing light that circles the iPhone’s screen as requests are being handled.

While Apple is promising Siri will be able to perform more tasks and be less prone to becoming confused, it won’t be able to interact with other apps installed on the iPhone until another software update comes out at a still-unspecified date.

Other AI features included in this software update will handle a variety of writing and proofreading tasks, summarize the content of emails and other documents. The AI also will provide a variety of editing tools to alter the appearance of photos and make it easier to find old pictures.

Other AI tricks still to come in future software updates will include the ability to create customized emojis on the fly or conjure other fanciful imagery upon request. Apple also plans to eventually enable its AI suite to get a helping hand from OpenAI’s ChatGPT when users want it.

Most of the AI features Apple introduced Monday are already available on Android-powered smartphones that Samsung and Google released earlier this year.

In an effort to distinguish its approach from the early leaders in AI, the iPhone’s suite of new technology is being marketed as “Apple Intelligence.” Apple is also promising its AI features will do a far better job protecting the privacy of iPhone owners by either running the technology on device or corralled in a fortress-like data center when some requests have to be processed remotely.

Because most iPhones currently in use around the world don’t have the computer chip needed for Apple’s AI, the technology is expected to drive huge demand for the new models during the holiday season and into next year, too. That’s the main reason why Apple’s stock price has soared 18% since the Cupertino, California, previewed its AI strategy at a conference in early June. The run-up has increased Apple’s market value by about $500 billion, catapulting it closer to becoming the first U.S. company to be worth $4 trillion.

Apple will give investors their first glimpse at how the iPhone 16 is faring Thursday when the company posts quarterly financial information for the July-September quarter — a period that includes the first few days the new models were on sale.

Demand for the high-end iPhone 15 models ticked upward as prices for them fell and the excitement surrounding Apple’s entrance into the AI market ramped up, according to an assessment of the smartphone market during the most recent quarter by the research firm International Data Corp.

Apple’s iPhone shipments rose 3.5 percent from the same time last year to 56 million worldwide during the July-September period, second only to Samsung, according to IDC. The question now is whether Apple’s gradual release of more AI will cause owners of older iPhones to splurge on the new models during the holidays, “future-proofing their purchases for the long term,” said IDC analyst Nabila Popal.

Also on Monday, Apple said that with the software update some AirPods wireless headphones can be used as hearing aids.

An estimated 30 million people — 1 in 8 Americans over the age of 12 — have hearing loss in both ears. Millions would benefit from hearing aids but most have never tried them, according to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders.",Associated Press News,https://apnews.com/article/apple-iphone-16-artificial-intelligence-software-update-d46b627cebfab90173a059c81bfeac1a,2024-10-28 15:01:12+00:00
Cholera spreads as Sudan grapples with rains and displacement,"For the second consecutive year Sudan is in the grip of a cholera outbreak that has left at least 28 people dead in the last month as rains fall in areas crammed with those fleeing the country's 16-month-old war, officials said.

Since July 22, when the current wave began, 658 cases of cholera have been recorded across five states, World Health Organization (WHO) country director Shible Sahbani told Reuters in Port Sudan.

With much of the country's health infrastructure collapsed or destroyed and staffing thinned by displacement, 4.3% of cases have resulted in deaths, a high rate compared to other outbreaks, Sahbani said.

Some 200,000 are at high risk of falling ill, he said.

The war between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has created one of the world's largest humanitarian crises and displaced more than 10 million people inside Sudan and beyond its borders.

The country is dealing with a total of five concurrent disease outbreaks include dengue fever and measles.

The RSF has advanced across swathes of Sudan, where people have been cut off from aid as the army has withheld access and RSF soldiers loot supplies and hospitals. Efforts to deliver aid to the western region of Darfur have been complicated by rains.

International experts have determined that there is a famine in Darfur's Zamzam camp, an area flooded in the rains and highly susceptible to cholera.

About 12,000 cases and more than 350 deaths were registered in the previous cholera wave between October 2023 and May 2024, health minister Haitham Mohamed Ibrahim said, adding that there had been no major outbreak in the nine years before the war.

The current outbreak is centered in Kassala and Gedaref states, which host 1.2 million displaced people.

In Gedaref, a Reuters reporter filmed pools of water attracting insects and large ponds of stagnant rain water mixing with refuse. A local official said that the vast majority of diseases were caused by insects, poor water quality, and sewage.

Many people fleeing raids by the RSF shelter in crowded, makeshift displacement centers, where lavatories have overflowed as heavier-than-usual rains continue to fall. Cholera is transmitted from food and water contaminated with infected feces and thrives in such conditions.

Sahbani said that states like Khartoum and Gezira, largely controlled by the RSF, had also seen cholera cases, while states in the Kordofan and Darfur regions could likely see outbreaks.

""The challenge is getting supplies to the areas we need them. Due to the rainy season many roads are not usable now, but also there are security constraints and bureaucratic constraints,"" he said.

On Friday, he told reporters in a virtual briefing that the International Coordinated Group for vaccine allocation (ICG) had approved delivery of 455,000 cholera vaccine doses to Sudan, some ""good news in the middle of this horrible crisis.""

Ibrahim said the army-aligned government had used ""unorthodox measures"" including air drops to try to get vaccines and supplies into those RSF-controlled areas as well as isolated army-controlled areas.

Both officials emphasized that the need in Sudan far outweighed the aid effort, particularly as the U.N.'s humanitarian appeal for Sudan is only about one-third funded.",Voice Of America,https://www.voanews.com/a/cholera-spreads-as-sudan-grapples-with-rains-and-displacement/7753955.html,2024-08-23 11:25:37+00:00
"Apple, Zuck, Elon, and the lesson of Microsoft Windows","Even though it's taking way longer than expected, Apple won't give up on building an EV.

Mark Zuckerberg is still spending massively on AI and the metaverse.

It's about building the next big platforms. If you're not in the race, you're not really a player.

Two things in tech shocked me this month.

First: Apple has been trying to build an electric vehicle to compete with Tesla for at least a decade, and it's still years away, according to Mark Gurman, the world's leading Apple reporter.

Second: After splurging tens of billions on the metaverse, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is now spending an estimated $18 billion on GPUs to chase the generative AI craze.

I asked my hedge fund manager friend about these hyper-expensive long-term projects. They are risky, given the huge costs. Why pursue them so aggressively?My friend helps run one of the best performing and most secretive hedge funds. I can't reveal their name. However, this person has been investing for more than 2 decades. They know their stuff and I regularly tap into this well of experience for advice.

Without pausing, this investor said ""I think Zuckerberg's metaverse bet could actually work out."" He shares similar views on Apple's Vision Pro goggles, which I've questioned in the past.

""The lesson of Microsoft Windows""

Then this hedge funder schooled me on the ""lesson of Microsoft Windows.""

This operating system was arguably the first major digital platform for the masses. It took many years to develop and massive upfront spending. The result was an ecosystem of hardware providers, developers, and users that generated so much lock-in and profit that Microsoft was accused of antitrust violations.

From that point on, any serious technologist wanted to build the next big platform. Others that came after include Google's Chrome/Search/Web empire, its Android mobile operating system, and Apple's supreme iOS. Meta's social media platforms and Amazon's AWS cloud business probably qualify. And Tesla's business might be a platform, too. (More not that later).

""Dreamy"" businesses

Platforms share similar attributes that make them massively expensive and time-consuming to build, but way more profitable and long-lasting than any other businesses on earth.

Billions of people and businesses rely on platforms. As they are used more, they become more useful and more valuable. They are almost impossible to compete with once they are up and running. And as Apple shows, there are endless ways to squeeze more money from platforms, even if antitrust regulators shut down bits of them.

Matthew Ball, a venture capitalist and former Amazon executive, called platforms ""dreamy"" businesses in an insightful blog last year.

He also pointed out that if you don't own a big platform, your life kinda sucks. Zuckerberg has the scars to prove it. One flick of Apple's privacy wrist and about $10 billion of Meta revenue disappeared. This scared the crap out of other tech companies. Google pays Apple about $20 billion a year to keep the iOS giant distributing its search engine. Not fun.

The biggest bets

This is why big tech companies are investing 100s of billions of dollars to find the next big platforms. They might fail, and that will be an epic waste of money, like the world has never seen before. But, if they succeed, the profit gusher will be so much bigger, and competitors will bow down — as most companies do today to the iOS god.

""Though the accumulated losses are terrifying, they're nevertheless dwarfed by the potential profits, as well as the security that comes from owning your own end-to-end platform versus relying on another,"" Ball wrote.

To give you a taste of the size of this phenomenon, here are recent research and development budgets of some Big Tech companies. This is just for one year:

Google: $40 billion

Meta: $35 billion

Apple: $30 billion

Microsoft: $27 billion

A new AI platform

Google will continue investing huge amounts to become the leading AI provider in the western world. Foundation models are the bedrock of this emerging platform. There are layers of tooling and other software on top, followed by new applications, such as chatbots, copilots and who knows what else. All users and developers will pay to access what Google hopes will be the new AI platform.

Microsoft will continue to pile money into its own AI platform ambitions. too. And it will ensure OpenAI gets all the cash and cloud support it needs to beat Google. Zuckerberg wants to win this too, and is willing to spend billions on GPUs and anything else required.

What are other big platforms of the future?

The metaverse, no matter how ridiculed it has been so far, could be a contender. Computers used to be huge, expensive and only accessible in a locked room inside a big university. You fed special pieces of paper into them to make them work. Then they were on your desk and you typed information into them. Then they were in your pocket and on your wrist, and we're speaking to them now. Is it such a stretch to put them on your face and see the world through them?

This is why Apple will continue to spend billions of dollars over decades to ensure that its Vision Pro, and endless future versions, will be the dominant ecosystem in an augmented-reality future. And it's why Zuckerberg will continue to spend heavily on Meta's Oculus devices and platform. They may both be spectacularly wrong. But if one of them is right, untold riches await.

The EV platform race

This is also why Apple will continue to spend billions of dollars developing an EV, even if it comes out 15 years or 20 years after Tesla started selling these vehicles.

I recently test drove Tesla Model 3 EVs with Business Insider's auto reporter Nora Naughton. She was irked by how her iPhone didn't connect seamlessly to Tesla's operating system in the car.

This is a classic tech platform battle, now playing out inside EVs. When billions of people drive many hours a week, Apple wants to own the device that they interact with. That's the car interface. Big Tech is all about winning our attention and being the first ""funnel"" that sends us out into the world. That is incredibly lucrative. Inside Tesla cars, it's Tesla that provides this funnel. There is no way Elon Musk will ever let Apple Carplay work inside his vehicles. Not a chance. That's giving valuable digital real estate to Apple.

Again, this is partly why Apple still toils to build its own EV. Just like with its installed base of more than 1 billion iPhones, Macs, Watches and other gadgets, the company wants to add EVs to this device roster.

Giving up is expensive, too

This brings an interesting lens to what Musk has been doing at Tesla. He started a price war. That is cutting into profits, but it also supports sales at a time when EV demand is wavering.

Meanwhile, most US automakers can't keep up. Even at higher prices, they lost money making EVs. Now, they are slashing EV investments and cutting production.

If EVs are one of the next big platforms, this cautious approach just plays into Musk's hands. He wants as many Tesla cars on the road as possible — an installed base, just like Apple has built. Notably, even though EV demand weakened in the fourth quarter, Tesla's US EV market share rose slightly.

Now, building cars is not as profitable as making iPhones, or churning out new versions of Windows or Android operating systems. Software is especially profitable. However, Tesla has worked out a way to make EVs more efficiently than many rivals, and it has built an EV supply chain that Apple probably envies. GM and Ford, in contrast, seem to be giving up right now.

If you're not in the platform-chasing game, many investors will discount you as a serious player. Tesla is valued at more than $650 billion. Meta is $1 trillion. Google and Amazon are worth wellover $1 trillion. Microsoft and Apple are at $3 trillion.

My hedge fund friend mentioned GM specifically, saying that this company was a dominant American institution for decades. Today, it has a market cap of about $50 billion.

I noted that $50 billion is a lot. ""Not really. It's an after-thought in the market now,"" my friend said.

Apple Intelligence Isn’t Ready to Wow You—Yet,"Apple’s artificial intelligence features are finally rolling out today, but you might find yourself saying, “Is that it?”

I've been living with a beta version of Apple Intelligence for over a month, and life hasn't changed much since its features arrived on my iPhone 16 Pro.

If you haven't braved the public beta, today you'll get to experience it for yourself. Apple is finally shipping its much-hyped artificial intelligence suite of features in iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and MacOS Sequoia 15.1, software updates rolling out for select iPhones, iPads, and Macs.

Powered by the company's large language models, Apple Intelligence has been pushed as one of the biggest reasons to buy the new iPhone 16, iPad Mini, or iMac. At WWDC this past June, Tim Cook said it would take the experience of using Apple products to ""new heights."" The problem? That experience, in its current form, is quite flat.

The First Landing

The Apple Intelligence rollout is uncharacteristic for Apple, which typically bundles all its flagship features and rolls them out in one big update, often alongside new devices. Here, iOS 18.1 arrives one month after iOS 18 and the iPhone 16 series. Even after installing iOS 18.1, you'll have to join a wait list to access Apple Intelligence—assuming you have a compatible device—though this should take only a few hours to be approved. And even then, you won't be able to access the best of Apple Intelligence's features. They won't come until iOS 18.2.

So what can you do right now? Let's start with Writing Tools, which helps you Rewrite, Proofread, or Summarize text wherever you are in the operating system. Rewrite changes the sentence's tone from casual to professional, for example, while Proofread fixes typos and improves grammar. Too bad it's nearly impossible to remember this feature exists, because it only shows up when you highlight words. Perhaps Writing Tools would be better as a little button built into the virtual keyboard.

You can type to Siri now, though this is technically not new. Previously this was an accessibility setting, which Apple has now baked into the experience, finally catching up to Alexa and Google Assistant which have had this default capability for years. Siri also has a new design, with a glowing effect around the screen, and the ability to understand queries a little easier, even if you trip up while asking the question. Still, it feels largely the same in day-to-day use, despite its new coat of paint—and that might feel like a bit of a letdown.

Elsewhere you'll see the option to send Smart Replies—quick AI-generated messages based on the context of the conversation, like “Thank you” or “Sounds good”—to people in Messages and Mail. While this can be helpful, it's hard to get excited about a feature that’s been built into Gmail since 2017.

Summaries are another big part of Apple Intelligence. You can use it to get an overview of web pages and even your notifications. If you have multiple messages from a group chat, the summary will highlight important things that were said and you'll be able to click in to see the full details. I have yet to get much use out of this, as my summaries are often a garbled mess of words.

One time, it summarized my work emails and said “medical emergency"" as a part of it. I checked my inbox to see what was up. Turns out someone said they were responding a day late due to a medical emergency but that they were fine. It wasn't an important work email—glad to hear they were fine—but the summary made me check my inbox when I didn't need to. More times than not, I found myself clicking into my notifications because Apple Intelligence highlighted something that seemed crucial but wasn't.

The most actionable first-wave Apple Intelligence features are Clean Up and the real-time transcribing capabilities in the Phone, Notes, and Voice Memo apps. The former lets you erase objects in your photos, something Google introduced in 2021 on its Pixel phones—just hit Edit on a photo and choose Clean Up, and it does a solid job of erasing whatever you selected and filling in the gap. The latter lets you hit record in Notes, Voice Memo, or even during phone calls, to get a transcription saved automatically. This one is super handy for me as a journalist.

Lastly, this one's a bit of a sleeper hit, but try the search function in Apple Photos. There are now fewer guardrails when you search for a photo, meaning just inputting something like “at the park with [your spouse's name]” should drum up all the images in your library for your perusal. It can understand that context, though you'll need to take advantage of features in Apple Photos like labeling people and pets. (Google also just unveiled a very similar feature in Google Photos.)

The Second Coming

It's not so much that what few features available in the first Apple Intelligence update are things we've seen from competitors years ago. After all, it doesn't matter whether Apple is playing catch up or not, because Apple users can now take advantage of some of these capabilities in a more private, secure way thanks to Apple's Private Cloud Compute (more info on this technology here).

But Apple should have waited to launch Apple Intelligence until all of its key features were available simultaneously, not in a piecemeal fashion. Siri's reputation has long been in the gutter—Apple Intelligence promises to change that, but Siri is almost the same in iOS 18.1. Most of the time, when I ask a question, I get the same result: “Here's what I found on the web.” Turns out you'll have to wait for iOS 18.2, which brings the ChatGPT integration that lets you ask more open-ended questions and get more detailed responses. The current Apple Intelligence experience suggests you're getting something new, but that's not the case.

It's with the next update that the most interesting voice features will arrive. For example, Siri will be able to understand the context of what's on your device's screen, so if someone texts you an address, you can ask Siri to save it to their contact card. And since Siri has access to your emails and messages, it will even be able to tap into personal context. Ask things like, “When do I have to leave for the airport to pick up my sister?” and Siri will provide the answer, looking at flight emails or messages your sister may have sent and then pairing that with traffic estimates.

The features that may indeed take the iPhone to new “heights” are only available in iOS 18.2. These include Image Playground, which lets you call on AI to generate images from text; Genmoji, to create new emojis from text; and Visual Intelligence, which can identify what's in front of you and provide context (like the name of an actor on a poster). I fully expect Genmoji to be the next hot thing because who doesn't want to create custom emojis?

I downloaded the developer beta of iOS 18.2, which arrived late last week. I've only been able to access Visual Intelligence so far but it's more interesting to use than many of the other existing Apple Intelligence features. To launch, press and hold the Camera Control button, point the camera viewfinder at something in the real world you want to learn more about, and you can “Ask” through ChatGPT or “Search” through Google. Is this experience similar to what Google Lens has been doing for seven years? Yes, but I've used it more times in the past week than most Apple Intelligence features in the past month (a dedicated button goes a long way).

Just yesterday, my wife wondered how our neighbor's flowers were still blooming so beautifully. We were curious what the flower was—she pulled out Google Lens on her Pixel, and I brought up Visual Intelligence on the iPhone. We snapped pics of the flowers, and both technologies more or less said the same thing—we were looking at daisies, and some varieties can bloom through the fall if they're well cared for in the right weather.

In any case, if you're feeling underwhelmed with Apple Intelligence, specifically with Siri, it's the next update that will finally elevate the more than 10-year-old assistant and hopefully bring it up to speed with the competition. But given its history, you'd be right to be skeptical that Siri will ever be useful for anything more than the weather report.",Wired,https://www.wired.com/story/apple-intelligence-isnt-ready-to-wow-you-yet/,2024-10-28 11:03:32.578000-04:00
EU accepts Apple plan to open iPhone tap-to-pay to rivals,"The EU on Thursday approved Apple's offer to allow rivals access to the iPhone's ability to tap-to-pay within the bloc, ending a lengthy probe and sparing it a heavy fine.

The case dates back to 2022 when Brussels first accused Apple of blocking rivals from its popular iPhone tap payment system in a breach of EU competition law.

""Apple has committed to allow rivals to access the 'tap and go' technology of iPhones. Today's decision makes Apple's commitments binding,"" EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.

""From now on, competitors will be able to effectively compete with Apple Pay for mobile payments with the iPhone in shops. So consumers will have a wider range of safe and innovative mobile wallets to choose from,"" she said.

The EU previously found that Apple enjoyed a dominant position by restricting access to ""tap-as-you-go"" chips or near-field communication (NFC), which allows devices to interconnect within a very short range, to favor its own system.

Now competitors will have access to the standard technology behind contactless payments to offer alternative tap-to-pay tools to iPhone users in the European Economic Area (EEA), which includes the EU and also Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.

Only customers with an Apple ID registered in the EEA would be able to make use of these outside apps, the European Commission said in a statement.

The changes must remain in force for 10 years and a ""monitoring trustee"" must be chosen by Apple to report to the commission during that period on their implementation.

Apple had risked a fine of up to 10% of its total worldwide annual turnover. Apple's total revenue in the year to September 2023 stood at $383 billion.

""Apple Pay and Apple Wallet will continue to be available in the EEA for users and developers, and will continue to provide an easy, secure and private way to pay, as well as present passes seamlessly from Apple Wallet,"" the company said in a statement.

The probe's conclusion comes at a particularly difficult moment in relations between the EU and Apple, especially over the bloc's new competition rules for big tech.

The Digital Markets Act (DMA) seeks to ensure tech titans do not privilege their own services over rivals, but the iPhone maker says it puts users' privacy at risk.

One of the DMA's main objectives is to give consumers more choice in the web browsers, app marketplaces, search engines and other digital services they use.

The EU in June accused Apple of breaching the DMA by preventing developers from freely pointing consumers to alternative channels for offers and content outside of its proprietary App Store.

It also kickstarted another probe under the DMA into Apple's new fees for app developers.

The company could face heavy fines if the DMA violations are confirmed.

In March, the EU slapped a $1.9 billion fine on Apple in a different antitrust case but the company has appealed the penalty in an EU court.

Escritora estadounidense Anne Applebaum pide armas para Ucrania mientras acepta premio de paz alemán,"VARSOVIA (AP) — La prominente periodista e historiadora estadounidense Anne Applebaum exhortó un apoyo continuo a Ucrania mientras aceptaba un prestigioso premio alemán el domingo, argumentando que el pacifismo frente a la agresión a menudo no es nada más que apaciguamiento.

Applebaum hizo su llamado ante un público en Fráncfort, donde fue galardonada con el Premio de la Paz del Comercio Librero Alemán. Junto a ella estaba su esposo, el ministro de Relaciones Exteriores polaco Radek Sikorski, quien al igual que su esposa es un gran partidario del uso del escenario internacional para apoyar a Ucrania mientras se defiende contra la brutal invasión rusa.

“Si hay incluso una pequeña oportunidad de que la derrota militar pueda ayudar a poner fin a este horrible culto de violencia en Rusia, justo como la derrota militar alguna vez puso fin al culto de violencia en Alemania, deberíamos tomarla”, dijo Applebaum.

Muchos alemanes han aceptado un espíritu de pacifismo como resultado de la agresión de su país bajo Adolf Hitler durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial. Y muchos ahora sienten recelo por el suministro de armas a Kiev, temiendo a Rusia y preocupándose de que podría provocar que la guerra se propague más allá de las fronteras ucranianas hacia el resto de Europa.

“Algunos incluso hacen un llamado de paz al mencionar solemnemente las ‘lecciones de la historia alemana’”, señaló Applebaum, según una transcripción de su discurso publicado por la organización del premio.

“Mientras estoy aquí aceptando este premio de la paz, parece que es el momento adecuado para señalar que ‘quiero la paz’ no siempre es un argumento moral”, dijo Applebaum. “Es también el momento adecuado para decir que la lección de la historia alemana no es que los alemanes deben ser pacifistas”.

“Al contrario, hemos sabido durante casi un siglo que una exigencia de pacifismo frente a una dictadura agresiva que avanza, puede simplemente representar el apaciguamiento y la aceptación de dicha dictadura”.",Associated Press News,https://apnews.com/article/ucrania-anne-applebaum-2dcda5607af2648adbe7d26414f3bada,2024-10-20 18:23:50+00:00
$1 rum cocktail at Applebee's highlights Halloween-themed drink deals,"A popular restaurant chain has resurrected its Halloween-themed $1 rum cocktail drink.

The ""Dollar Zombie"" returns to Applebee's this year, highlighting several new additions to the menu in October.

Made with rum, passion fruit, pineapple, cherry and lime, the Dollar Zombie is garnished with a gummy candy in the shape of a brain (because zombies eat brains in the movies).

The affordable beverage was first introduced in 2018.

Although the Dollar Zombie has a listing price of just $1 — tax not included — some on social media shared their skepticism, believing the drink to be more of a gimmick than filled with booze.

""I can already tell by looking at it that [it's] 90% Sprite, 5% blue lemonade or some [expletive], 2% simple syrup and 3% alcohol,"" one person wrote on X.

But others seemed to embrace it for what it is: a cheap drink.

""Our guests love Halloween, and we take pride in providing an exciting Halloween lineup of a variety of beverages so they can get into the 'spooky spirit' all month long,"" Nathan Grover, executive director of bar and beverage at Applebee's, told Fox News Digital in a statement.

Other Halloween cocktails on the menu at Applebee's are the new $5 ""Boo Lagoon,"" the ""Franken Mama"" and ""Dracula's Juice.""

The Boo Lagoon is described as a ""wickedly delicious concoction"" made with Bacardi Superior rum, Malibu coconut rum, blue curaçao and pineapple juice. It is served in Applebee's signature margarita glass.

Applebee's, which moved its corporate headquarters from Glendale, California, to Pasadena, California, last year, also has two new offerings from its $10 ""Boo-zy Buckets"" lineup.

The Franken Mama – a playful take on the Bahama Mama – is essentially a larger version of the Dollar Zombie but with Bacardi Superior rum.

Dracula's Juice is a mix of Patron tequila and Ole Smoky blackberry moonshine with triple sec, strawberry and lemon.

Both are served in a 32-ounce bucket.

""There's a treat for everyone this October at Applebee's,"" Grover said.",Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/1-rum-cocktail-applebees-highlights-halloween-themed-drink-deals,2024-10-03 15:01:08-04:00
"Oura CEO calls Apple Watch sales ban a 'David and Goliath story,' says he'll keep an eye on Samsung's rival smart ring","Oura CEO Tom Hale weighed in on the patent dispute between Apple and healthtech company Masimo.

A lawsuit filed by Masimo halted the sale of the newest Apple Watches in the US.

Oura's CEO said the company, which holds many patents, will closely examine Samsung's Galaxy Ring.

Oura Health CEO Tim Hale doesn't seem worried about Samsung's plan to compete with Oura in the wearable ""smart ring"" market.

""We welcome the validation,"" he said in an interview on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" show. ""We welcome the idea that smart rings are something that people should have.""

Hale said that Oura will closely monitor the development of Samsung's new ""Galaxy Ring,"" announced last week, to see if there are any concerns of potential intellectual property violations.

""It's very important for us to protect the innovations that we've brought to the market,"" he said, noting that Oura has filed over 150 patent for their product.

""The reality is we'll see what gets delivered in the market,"" Hale said. ""We'll see whether or not it infringes on [Oura's technology]. And frankly, we'll take the action that's appropriate.""

Samsung did not immediately return Business Insider's request for comment ahead of publication.

Hale noted that, while ""announcing that you have a smart ring is easy,"" it may be difficult for Samsung to design a wholly original product. ""It's a hard problem. It's not easy.""

The Oura CEO was also asked about Apple, which is currently involved in a patent dispute with medical tech company Masimo, which resulted in a halt on Apple's ability to sell any Apple Watches with a previously launched blood-oxygen monitoring feature.

That dispute, Hale said, is ""a David-and-Goliath story for the ages.""

""I mean, who would have thought that Masimo, this company that very few people have actually heard of … has been able to get Apple to take a product off the shelf.""

The International Trade Commission, a US regulator, ruled in October that Apple infringed on Masimo's proprietary blood oxygen monitoring technology when the feature was included in the latest line of Apple Watches. The judgment barred Apple from selling the Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches in the US.

Apple appealed the import ban, but a federal court put it back in place last week. The iPhone maker is reportedly planning on removing the blood oxygen feature altogether via a software update to continue selling the watches.

Hale cited the Masimo dispute as evidence that smaller, lesser-known companies can still take on tech giants if they suspect patent infringement.

Oura's rings help monitor biometrics like heart rate and blood pressure. The devices also measure blood oxygen, though Hale said that feature is distinct from the Apple Watch technology — with sensors adapted for the finger rather than the wrist. He described it as ""the same mechanism [as Masimo's], but a very different approach.""

He conceded that some technological similarities between Oura's product and the Galaxy Ring might be unavoidable.

""There are certainly things like the laws of physics, or the approach you might take to pack a small number of sensors into a small space, or the algorithms that you use to create biosignals and turn them into meaningful data,"" he said. ""Those are things that we'll see when the product is in the market and the evidence is in.""

"Apples and honey serve as key Rosh Hashanah symbols, says rabbi","The traditional foods that are consumed during the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashanah, which began Wednesday at sunset, complement the deeper meaning of the holiday, a rabbi told Fox News Digital.

""Rosh Hashanah is the beginning of the Jewish year,"" Daniel Rowe, rabbi and senior educator at Aish Jerusalem, said in a video interview. ""It's also seen as a day of judgment and it's a celebration – because that judgment sounds very harsh."" (See the video at the top of this article.)

Aish is a Jewish organization dedicated to inspiring ""people to live more thoughtful, spiritual and impactful lives,"" according to its website.

Rosh Hashanah, Rowe said, ""is a time of very deep introspection and reflection, [a] time of really planning forward.""

He added, ""Really, it's the belief that God believes in us and that our actions matter. That's significant. And then we can use each year to recreate ourselves and become better people in the year ahead.""

During the two days of Rosh Hashanah, Jewish people ""intensely look at the year ahead. It's almost like we're laying the genetic code of who we want to become,"" Rowe said.

That includes food.

""Everything we do on Rosh Hashanah, whether it's the foods that we eat, whether it's the prayers that we utter, is about that deep cry inside us that says, 'This world can be a better place,'"" Rowe said.

Throughout the holiday, a person thinks about how ""everything I do, from the biggest acts to the smallest act of eating with a deeper consciousness,"" can ""help me to become a blessing to others and shine God's light into the world,"" Rowe said.

There are ""quite a lot of food customs"" that are associated with the holiday, Rowe said — and many Jewish cultures have their own traditions.

""The most popular is to dip an apple in honey,"" Rowe said.

The apple, he said, ""is a simple fruit that grows on a tree"" and serves as a symbol of the blessing of the world, producing things throughout the year.

""But we also want it to be sweet, because the apple represents that which is nutritious and good for us,"" he said.

Rowe continued, ""We don't just want things ‘good.’ We'd also like to be able to appreciate the good in all of them.""

Rosh Hashanah, Rowe said, is a time to consider how ""every single item of food could be a blessing and could manifest some kind of goodness.""

""We should therefore take every opportunity and, just like food, put it inside ourselves, build ourselves and then become a blessing for the year ahead,"" he said.

Unlike Passover, which has different definitions of kosher food — during Rosh Hashanah, the standard rules apply.

Keeping kosher ""is following the biblical commandment,"" Rowe said.

""God asks the Israelites about the certain foods they can and can't eat. So, for example – carnivorous animals, animals that kill other animals – we can't eat,"" he said.

Said Rowe, ""So if an animal hurts another animal, we don't eat it. We have animal drives. We don't want that to be a part of us.""

Kosher animals, Rowe said, are those with split hooves that chew their cud – traits that symbolize something a human should want to embody.

""The split-hoofed animals are typically animals that are easy to domesticate,"" he said, noting such examples as sheep and cows.

Conversely, things like horses and camels are not kosher as ""those animals aren't tamable.""

Neither are bugs, which can cause issues when parts of beetles are used in animal dyes, he said.

Chewing cud means that the animal does not waste, Rowe said.

""The Torah's telling us, 'Make sure our own animal instincts also are things that can be tamed and that don't waste anything,'"" he said.

""Also, food has to be prepared in some ways,"" Rowe said, with no mixing of meat and dairy products.

""The biblical command is not to mix meat and milk, which is a bit like life and death,"" Rowe said.

""So, in a kitchen, milk products and meat products will be kept separate as food is being prepared, and they'll be eaten separately as well.""

Following kosher laws, Rowe said, is a way of acknowledging ""we are what we eat"" and considering the implications of the food consumed.

""Our bodies are formed of the foods we eat,"" he said. ""And it's almost asking us at least this – how many understand it – that when we put things in our body, we should be thinking, 'What type of being do we want to be?'""",Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/apples-honey-serve-rosh-hashanah-symbols-says-rabbi,2024-10-03 05:00:46-04:00
"Apple, Goldman ordered to pay $89M for mishandling Apple Card transactions","NEW YORK (AP) — A federal regulator on Wednesday ordered Apple and Goldman Sachs to pay a combined $89 million for deceiving consumers and mishandled transaction disputes of Apple Card customers.

The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau orders point to “customer service breakdowns and misrepresentations” around Apple and Goldman’s credit card partnership. Apple failed to send tens of thousands of Apple Card disputes to Goldman, and when such customer disputes were reported, the investment bank did not follow federal requirements for investigating, the agency said.

As a result, many consumers faced long waits to get their money back from disputed charges and, in some cases, saw incorrect negative information added to their credit reports, the CFPB added.

Apple and Goldman were also accused of misleading people who purchased iPhones and other Apple devices about interest-free payments for the credit card. The CFPB found that many customers thought they would automatically get interest-free financing when buying an Apple device with Apple Card, for example, but were instead charged that interest, while Goldman misled consumers about some refund applications.

In a statement, Apple said it learned about the “inadvertent issues” years ago and address them along with Goldman Sachs, adding that it strongly disagrees with the CFPB’s characterization of its conduct. The California tech giant added that “Apple Card is one of the most consumer-friendly credit cards available, and was specifically designed to support users’ financial health.”

Goldman spokesperson Nick Carcaterra echoed that sentiment, noting the investment bank was proud to develop the credit card product with Apple, and said it was pleased to reach a resolution with the CFPB. Both companies also maintained that they had already worked to help impacted customers.

Wednesday’s CFPB action orders refunds for consumers and penalties for both companies. Apple is required to pay a $25 million penalty, the CFPB said, and Goldman a $45 million penalty and at least $19.8 million in redress.

The agency is also barring Goldman, which is already struggling with its wider consumer banking business, from launching another new credit card unless it can prove the product “will actually comply with the law.”

“These failures are not mere technicalities. They resulted in real harm to real people,” CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in prepared remarks, noting hundreds of thousands of Apple Card users were impacted overall. In a separate statement, he added that “Big Tech companies and big Wall Street firms should not behave as if they are exempt from federal law.”

Apple partnered with Goldman to launch the Apple Card in 2019. The now-popular credit card runs on the Mastercard network and is deeply embedded into Apple Pay. It is designed primarily to be used on devices like the iPhone or Apple Watch.

The CFPB suggested that Apple and Goldman launched Apple Card prematurely, pointing to third-party warnings about technological issues prior to the card’s launch.

Goldman’s venture into consumer banking has been far from smooth sailing. The Wall Street firm recently ended its credit card partnership with General Motors — with Barclays coming forward as its replacement just last week.",Associated Press News,https://apnews.com/article/apple-card-goldman-sachs-89-million-fine-e991849da050a5b072ba2a7a016af310,2024-10-23 19:53:01+00:00
The Top New Features in Apple’s iOS 18 and iPadOS 18,"Apple is rolling out iOS 18.1 now with Apple Intelligence. Here are all the top new features and how to download it.

Apple executives always describe new hardware and software as the “best” or “biggest” ever, but the delivery doesn’t usually live up to the hype (see the iPads from earlier this year). However, iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 might be deserving of a few of those adjectives. The new operating systems, now available, have the usual degree of year-over-year quality-of-life improvements, but Apple Intelligence steals the limelight.

This is Apple's implementation of artificial-intelligence-powered tasks that have been sweeping through the tech industry over the past year. Even Siri is getting an overdue upgrade—the biggest since the voice assistant’s debut 13 years ago. Here are all the new features in iOS 18 and iPadOS 18, not to mention iOS 18.1, how to download both operating systems, and what exactly you’ll experience with Apple Intelligence.

Updated October 28, 2024: We've added the launch of Apple Intelligence with iOS 18.1.

What Is Apple Intelligence?

Every major tech company has been integrating artificial intelligence into its hardware and software, from Google to Samsung to Microsoft, and now it's Apple's turn. Apple Intelligence is the term you'll see the company throw around over the next few years, and it powers many of the new AI features in its devices.

It's powered by Apple's large language models (partly trained through data from the public web, according to Axios’ Ina Fried) and requires Apple silicon, the company's bespoke chips which have a hybrid architecture designed to run AI tasks. Even though the devices Apple Intelligence runs on are capable of the on-device processing needed to complete AI tasks, sometimes the task is too big and needs to be sent off to the cloud. When a task requires more processing, it'll be sent to a secure data center stacked with computers that also run Apple silicon. While this method of computing is typically less private, Apple claims that its Private Cloud Compute platform focuses on ensuring data privacy for each user. Only data relevant to your query is sent to these servers, and the data is only used for your requests and never stored.

Before you get too excited, Apple Intelligence will not be available for every device that supports iOS 18. It's only supported on select processors and in US English. You will also need to set Siri's language to English.

What exactly is Apple Intelligence? Apple breaks down its key capabilities into three buckets: Language, Images, and Action.

Throughout Apple's hardware and software, you'll find new writing tools that draw on the power of generative AI to assist your writing. This includes Rewrite, which can help change the tone of your text to sound more friendly or more professional (like in an email), and Proofread, which more or less does what the name suggests. You can also summarize selected text with a tap.

These text-based improvements go past writing. It also powers Priority notifications, which appear at the top of your notification list and summarize it so you get a more digestible summary at a glance. Similarly, the Mail app will see Priority messages, which means important emails will float to the top of your inbox. You can also get summaries of long emails, and a Smart Reply function lets you quickly respond to emails (even answers to multiple questions posed in an email), not unlike what's available in Gmail.

In the Notes, Voice Memos, and Phone app, you can hit the record button (yes, even on a call) to get an audio recording with a transcript, and Apple Intelligence can create a summary of that transcript. Apple says that in states that require two-party consent for recordings, the person on the other end of the line will be made aware that the call is being recorded.

Finally, there's a new Focus mode called Reduce Interruptions that can understand your personal context, so while it hides incoming stuff that could distract you, it knows enough about what you've got going on to allow a text from your babysitter to come through.

The Apple Intelligence image features largely revolve around generating new images through artificial intelligence. Much of this happens in Image Playground, an experience baked into other apps (though it also exists as a stand-alone app). You can generate images based on a description, suggested concepts, and even from people in your Photos library. You have control over the style, and it can be tweaked to match whatever's happening in the app you're using it in.

Genmoji just might be the most anticipated feature out of everything Apple has announced. It lets you generate emojis directly from the keyboard with text prompts. You can also pull a person's photo from your Photos library to make an emoji based on their looks. You'll have to provide a description first, but then you can adjust the description until it suits what you are going for.

Image Wand is another image generation system that works specifically in the Notes app. With your finger or Apple Pencil, you can circle a sketch to have Apple Intelligence create something that looks more refined, but you can also circle empty space, and it will generate an image based on the surrounding text. It's an easy way to add more visual variety to your notes.

The Photos app is getting a few AI features. You can make a Memory Movie by entering a description like “All the desserts I ate during the summer last year, set to a pop song,” and Apple's AI will find the right images and video, put it to a song, and craft a shareable movie out of it. It'll also be easier to search for specific photos—just describe what you want and it'll find it, even moments in video clips (similar to Google's recently announced Ask Photos feature). Lastly, you can erase unwanted objects in the background of your photos with the new Clean Up tool in the photo editor—exactly like Magic Eraser on Pixel phones and Samsung's Object Eraser.

The final part of Apple Intelligence is arguably one that might be used the most often, and it involves Siri. The assistant has a new look—when activated, the edges of the screen will glow—and you can now type your requests to Siri instead of using your voice (something you've been able to do with Google Assistant for several years).

The idea is you'll be able to speak more naturally with Siri, and the assistant will be able to understand context better than ever before. You can say, “Play the podcast my wife sent me the other day,” and Siri will be able to pull it up. That kind of thing.

Siri can also help explain how to do certain functions on your phone if you're not sure (maybe Samsung was onto something with Bixby). And if you make a mistake mid-sentence, there's no need to start all over again. Siri will be able to understand your slipup, and it remembers the context of your previous query, so you won't need to repeat things over and over again.

Much like how Google's Gemini is drawing on context based on what's happening on the screen, Siri can now understand what is on the screen when you activate it, so if someone texts you an address, you can activate Siri and ask it to add the address to the person's contact card. All of this is expected to work in first- and third-party apps.

Apple Intelligence apparently still needs a boost for some occasions, and so Apple has tapped OpenAI's ChatGPT to power them. The company says it's using the GPT-4o model, and you are in control of when Siri uses ChatGPT. This powers features such as when you ask about the subject of a photo or a document (like scanning a hundred-page PDF), and Compose, which lets you generate original images and text from a query. All of these GPT features are free with no account required, though if you already are a subscriber, you can link your account and access paid features.

Also on the way is Apple's version of Google Lens, dubbed Visual Intelligence. This is where the new Camera Control button comes into play on the latest iPhone 16 range. Press and hold it and it will open the camera viewfinder, but instead of taking a photo, you can “Ask” ChatGPT to explain what you're looking at or search it through Google. You can use this to figure out who that actor is on a movie poster, find out the type of flower in front of you, or glean more information about a landmark.

New Features in iOS 18

OK, onto the more traditional software features. I've collected the top features in iOS 18 below, but there are tons of smaller changes. You can view the full list directly from Apple.

For the first time, you can arrange your apps and widgets however you'd like (just like on Android). Say goodbye to the fixed list of grids Apple has forced on us for nearly two decades. You can make further personalization to the app icons as well, tuning them to a specific color to match or complement your wallpaper, and even convert them to dark mode. You can make these apps and widgets look larger too.

Control Center, the hub that appears when you swipe down on the right edge of the iPhone, is now more customizable. There are now tabs within the Control Center, and you can scroll through them with one continuous swipe on the home screen. These include your favorites—the most important things you want accessible in the Control Center—media playback and even smart home controls.

You can customize the size and layout of everything in Control Center, and this extends to the lock screen controls—you can switch out the two icons at the bottom of your iPhone's lock screen to something more helpful. Expect new controls from third-party apps.

You can finally hide apps to prevent anyone from snooping, or you can lock the app so that it asks for a passcode or biometric authentication every time it's launched. The information from this app will be hidden throughout the system, even in notifications and searches. Google debuted a similar new feature called Private Space, which is coming to Android later this year.

Apple's Photos app got a huge redesign in iOS 18. Now, you have a photo grid at the top, and below, you can swipe through different collections, such as Recent Days, Trips, and People & Pets. This upgrade is tied with several other improvements powered by Apple Intelligence, like Clean Up, which can erase unwanted objects in the background of your photos, and the ability to find any image easily via search.

Arguably one of the most anticipated announcements from Apple ended up as a tiny footnote amid the company's announcements. RCS is Rich Communication Services, the texting standard that followed SMS/MMS. Android phones have supported RCS for several years, allowing for an upgraded texting experience that pulls features from instant messaging apps, like typing indicators, read receipts, and improved photo and video quality. However, none of this works when an Android user texts an iPhone (or vice versa) because Apple didn't support RCS and used the older SMS standard.

That's changing now, “RCS messages bring richer media and deliver and read receipts for those who don't use iMessage,"" according to Apple's marketing materials. These texts will still appear green (instead of blue when you text fellow iPhone owners via iMessage), but it might finally spell the end of the broken texting experience that has caused so many people strife.

If you have an iPhone 14 or newer, you can take advantage of texting via satellite when you don't have Wi-Fi or a cellular connection (like when you're on a plane). Apple says all of these iMessages sent via satellite are end-to-end encrypted.

The Messages app itself is getting a few new perks too. You can add animated effects to any letter, word, or phrase—these are suggested as you type. And Apple's Tapback feature (emoji reactions) now works with any emoji or sticker. Most importantly, you can now schedule texts and send them at a specific time, a standard texting feature available in most messaging apps.

It might be time to say goodbye to your password manager—at least, Apple would be thrilled if you did. The company's new native Passwords app supports end-to-end encryption and is about to become the way to find your passwords and ID verification codes on Apple devices. This app will work across all of Apple's hardware and even Windows (via the iCloud for Windows app). If you enable AutoFill, Apple says your passwords will automatically populate in the app.

This is technically a feature in macOS Sequoia, but you will be able to access your iPhone's screen via the iPhone Mirroring app in the macOS Dock. You can completely use your Mac keyboard and trackpad to interact with the iPhone, even have audio from it play onto your Mac's speakers. It even supports drag and drop, so you can pull files from your virtual iPhone screen into your Mac. If you have an iPhone-specific notification, click on it from your Mac and it will launch your mirrored iPhone, allowing you to act on it without having to pick up your device.

During all of this, your iPhone stays locked.

New iPadOS 18 Features

It's worth noting many of these iPad features are also available on iOS 18, and vice versa: Almost all the iOS 18 features above are also available on your iPad. Sadly, there's not much here in iPadOS 18 that makes the iPad more like a computer, but many of these additions are much appreciated.

Now you don't have to feel bad about your chicken-scratch handwriting. Apple's Smart Script “re-creates” your handwriting, so you can scribble down as fast as you can and the system will refine it to be more legible. It can do all of this while apparently still keeping your handwriting style intact. Also, if you paste typed text into a note that's been handwritten, it'll be converted to your handwriting. You can also scratch off text to erase it.

The Calculator app is now finally available on the iPad, though it's far from basic. Apple has injected a feature called Math Notes with Apple Pencil. This lets you write equations and the app will compute and solve it as soon as you draw an equals sign. It can solve all the same functions as a scientific calculator.",Wired,https://www.wired.com/story/apple-iphone-ios-18-ipados-18-new-features/,2024-06-11 12:11:21.318000-04:00
"Media analysts say national security law, trial of pro-democracy publisher Jimmy Lai signal sharp decline in freedom","In the four years since Hong Kong enacted its national security law, the country's press freedom record is in free fall, according to media advocates.

More than 900 journalists have lost their jobs, several media outlets have closed or moved overseas, and some journalists, including pro-democracy Apple Daily publisher Jimmy Lai, are in prison.

""The Chinese and Hong Kong government's forced closure of Apple Daily and prosecutions of its owner and editors are very chilling, and they exemplify the city's sharp decline in press and other freedoms,"" said Maya Wang, the interim China director of Human Rights Watch, also known as HRW.

Once a mainstay of press freedom, Hong Kong's media community has faced numerous setbacks since passage of the 2020 Beijing-backed legislation that cracks down on independent media. The most egregious example is the trial against Lai, which has lasted more than 90 days with the court currently adjourned until July 24.

Lai, who denies charges against him filed under the national security law, has been in custody since December 2020. He and six former staff at Apple Daily — the media outlet he founded — were first arrested in the August of that year.

Apple Daily was shuttered that same year, after authorities froze its assets.

Prosecutors have used more than 150 videos, op-eds and other articles from Apple Daily in their case against Lai. The publisher faces life in prison if convicted.

But rights organizations and international lawyers say the claims against the elderly publisher and his media outlet are ""baseless"" and that charges should be dropped.

Hong Kong's security bureau did not respond to VOA's email requesting comment. Authorities have previously disputed accusations that the trial of Lai is unfair.

The trial of the other former Apple Daily executives has been postponed for more than two years, waiting for Lai's case to conclude, according to Reporters Without Borders, also known as RSF.

RSF and other rights organizations including HRW and Freedom House have called for the immediate release of those in custody.

Calling the prosecutions ""baseless,"" Wang of HRW told VOA via email that the cases ""should also remind the world what Hong Kong has become: a place where people can get life in prison for criticizing the government.""

Wang added that Lai, who is 76, might be suffering from ill health, which adds to the urgency of his release.

Aleksandra Bielakowska, RSF's Pacific Asia Bureau advocacy officer, told VOA it is unclear what will happen in the coming months. But, she said, ""I estimate that the sentencing will be prolonged until the start of fall.""

Bielakowska described Lai's case as a ""sham trial"" to prove what Hong Kong can do to silence the press wanting to talk about the issues that are not aligned with China.

She noted that earlier in the year, the United Nations raised concerns about the treatment of a witness called to give testimony.

In a letter to Chinese authorities, the U.N. special rapporteur on torture said she was ""deeply concerned that evidence that is expected to be presented against Jimmy Lai imminently may have been obtained as a result of torture or other unlawful treatment,"" and called for an investigation into the allegations of mistreatment and torture.

Bielakowska has been observing Lai's trial. But when she tried to travel to Hong Kong in April for a hearing, her entry was blocked. Bielakowska says she was detained for six hours at the airport, searched, and questioned before being deported.

Since the national security law's enactment, several media outlets have closed or moved some parts of their operations outside of Hong Kong, including VOA's sister network Radio Free Asia and The Wall Street Journal. RSF says that the environment for media has prompted many journalists to leave Hong Kong.

There is an atmosphere of fear for the journalists working on the ground, said Bielakowska, adding that Hong Kong officials have not given a lot of hope for press freedom, and that independent reporting is already deteriorating significantly in China.

Alongside the Apple Daily case, the law has been used to arrest hundreds of pro-democracy activists.

Beijing has dismissed concerns that the security law is affecting press freedom, saying the legislation is needed to maintain stability.

Yaqiu Wang, research director for China and Hong Kong at Freedom House, said her organization is advocating for the U.S. and other governments to impose sanctions against Hong Kong officials involved in the prosecution of Lai and others charged under the national security law.

In December, the U.S. Congressional-Executive Commission on China in a statement also said the U.S. ""should sanction the judges and prosecutors involved in this case.""

Hong Kong ranks 135 out of 180 on the RSF World Press Freedom Index, where 1 shows the best media environment. In 2019, the year before the national security came in, Hong Kong ranked 73.",Voice Of America,https://www.voanews.com/a/watchdog-apple-daily-trial-typifies-declining-press-freedom-in-hong-kong/7682781.html,2024-07-02 22:11:20+00:00
This buzzy $199 AI device company's CEO answers the question on everyone's mind: Why not just make it an app?,"The Rabbit R1, a pocket-sized AI device, sold out within 24 hours of its January 2024 launch.

Despite that success, techies have wondered why the AI gadget isn't just a smartphone app.

Selling the software on Apple's App Store could make room for rivals, Rabbit CEO told Fast Company.

In early 2024, Rabbit started selling the Rabbit R1, an AI-powered handheld device meant to help people complete tasks that normally require opening apps on a smartphone or using a traditional computer. These might include booking flights and making reservations, or merely answering questions.

The product clearly caught the eye of tech fans, with the company selling out of its first batch of 10,000 Rabbit R1 units within 24 hours of its launch. Since then, it's sold out of four more batches, and is currently taking orders for a 50,000-strong sixth batch. Prices start at $199.

But for those who own a smartphone — and may have small pockets — one question is top of mind: Why not just make the AI gadget an app, rather than another bit of hardware to carry around?

Jesse Lyu, the CEO of Rabbit, helped answer the question. The Chinese technology entrepreneur said the decision to make the Rabbit R1 a separate device is partially due to his concerns about working with Apple, as well as about competition within the AI software market.

""In a perfect world, tomorrow, Siri will just do something like this, or even better,"" Lyu told Fast Company in a recent interview. ""But from my perspective, how do I want to build a business?""

The CEO told Fast Company he wants to avoid working within the app ecosystem as much as possible to avoid potential challenges down the line. Making Rabbit an app, Lyu said, is similar to giving away its intellectual property to Apple since the tech giant would be able to see its code. Creating and maintaining scalable apps for iOS and Android, he added, can also get expensive. Plus, making Rabbit an app could lead to separate spinoff apps that could steal users away.

""You can be very successful on the App Store, but you have that lack of sense of security,"" Lyu told the Fast Company. ""Like, what if tomorrow there's a better app? Think of filter apps for Instagram. There's no loyalty whatsoever!""

In comments to Business Insider, Lyu also said that if Rabbit made its AI model into an app, it would ""limit its potential"" for changing how people interact with their devices.

""We believe a custom-built hardware gives us the possibility to rethink that new user experience, which simply isn't possible on a fixed form factor like today's smartphones,"" Lyu told BI.

Apple didn't immediately respond to BI's request for comment before publication.

According to Fast Company, Lyu also says his decision to make the Rabbit R1 a standalone device may be what his company needs to protect its unique AI model from being copied — and to distinguish itself in a crowded consumer market.

""It's so good that we're gonna protect it to the point that we want to build dedicated hardware just to run it,"" Lyu told Fast Company, referring to the AI model that powers the device.

Lyu's comments come as other tech companies launch their own AI hardware products in a battle to create the iPhone of the AI era. Last November, startup Humane released its AI pin, a wearable device that can project information onto the palm of a user's hand. Two months prior, Meta unveiled the latest iteration of Ray-Ban smart glasses updated with AI features.

Like Humane's pin, the Rabbit R1 drew skepticism from the tech community — including the cofounder behind Siri — over its practicality. Still, the pocket-sized device seems to have captured customers' interest.

And while Lyu acknowledges that carrying an additional device around could be seen as undesirable, that's ""a problem that you don't need to worry about now."" Instead, he's focused on making sure the key AI software works, he told Fast Company.

See Griff Put a Dreamy Spin on Charli XCX's 'Apple',"""There’s such a style and a uniqueness to Charli’s writing and attitude that I love,"" British singer-songwriter tells Triple J's Like a Version

Griff — the British singer-songwriter who has spent the past few years opening for the likes of Taylor Swift, Dua Lipa, Coldplay, and soon Sabrina Carpenter — has put her own spin on Charli XCX’s Brat breakout “Apple.

Speaking to Triple J’s Like a Version, where she delivered her dream-pop cover, Griff said, “I just think that what Charli’s done with this album and with Brat has been so inspiring.”

“It’s been such a cultural movement, and as a fellow female pop girl, I love it. I’m a big fan of it. I think pop can be so saturated with the usual, same-old lyrics but when you listen to ‘Apple’ you’re a bit like ‘hang on a second’, and then you listen to it again and you realise there’s more layers to it,” she added.

“I just think [Charli] knows how to be an artist. She doesn’t seem like she cares about what people think really in a sense that she just does what she wants to do. There’s such a style and a uniqueness to Charli’s writing and attitude that I love.”

Rolling Stone recently profiled Griff, along with Rachel Chinouriri and Raye, as part of the new wave of British women of color who are breaking the pop mold.

“I always saw myself and my career as being more of a songwriter,” the Jamaican-Chinese and British musician told Rolling Stone. “I don’t know if it was a conscious thing, but I didn’t ever see myself as someone that would be sellable or desirable in this space, because it’s just nothing I’ve ever seen.”

Griff grew up in a largely white, middle-class English suburbia, but her parents fostered children from every background. “I’ve just existed in many different pockets of culture, and I think that maybe I ran to music to give me confidence in the midst of me trying to understand where I fit in the world,” Griff added. “I knew that when I would sit at the piano and write songs, I felt at peace, and I felt good. I think often I didn’t quite know if I felt that in other social contexts.”",Rolling Stone,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/griff-charli-xcx-apple-cover-1235092093/,2024-08-30 13:52:13+00:00
Apple’s Sales in China Are Stalling. What Will It Sacrifice to Turn Things Around?,"With iPhone sales down and Apple Intelligence banned, Apple looks ready to compromise.

Is Apple losing its grip in China? With yet another year-on-year fall in iPhone sales now tucked rather uncomfortably under its belt, it's on increasingly shaky ground in the world's largest smartphone market—a market it once relied on for growth. Despite clawing its way back into the top five manufacturers (having slipped out of it entirely earlier this year), it's still losing a worrying amount of market share to growth from domestic brands like Huawei, OPPO, Honor, and Xiaomi.

And yet, in spite of this, Apple stocks recently hit a new all-time high. Why? The market has been buoyed by the belief that Apple Intelligence will coax the masses into buying a new phone, ending the curse of longer upgrade cycles. But in China, there’s a big problem with that idea.

Apple Intelligence currently can't launch there (or in Europe, for that matter), because it doesn't currently meet the country's very strict regulatory requirements around AI—one of the biggest issues being its heavy reliance on ChatGPT for some requests, which has been banned in China since February 2023.

Is there a solution? And if there is, will it involve compromises a US company should think twice about taking, even with tens or hundreds of billions of dollars on the line? Tim Cook doesn't think so.

""We’re engaged, as you would guess, with both regulatory bodies,” Cook said during a recent earnings call, referring to the European and China regulators.

“Our objective is to move as fast as we can, obviously, because our objective is always to get features out there for everyone. We have to understand the regulatory requirements before we can commit to doing that and commit a schedule to doing that.”

In this context, Apple’s decision to open up its biggest research center outside of the US in Shenzhen, China, earlier this month raises questions. At the very least, it could be seen as something of an olive branch—helping to heal the relationships that soured after it began shifting even more of its iPhone production to India earlier this year.

Perhaps this is precisely part of the necessary equation for Apple’s AI future in China. It needs to maintain favor in the way it simply does not in the West.

Key Challenges

“In China, Apple’s outlook remains stable as it still has a solid customer stickiness, but it won’t be an easy path. Cautious consumer sentiment and Huawei’s return with innovative products are the key challenges to Apple,” says Will Wong, senior research manager at IDC.

“Consumer sentiment” is a term heard quite regularly in relation to Apple’s position in China. The public often favors local brands as the better value and, at times, simply the better option.

In some, such feelings may have been turbocharged by the US government’s torpedoing of Huawei under Trump. In 2019 the Chinese mega-brand was not just competing for smartphone market supremacy in China, but globally. Then in May 2019, sanctions cut the ties between Huawei and Android-maker Google, eradicating Huawei phones’ appeal for almost all Western buyers.

Apple may not have chosen such a move, but it is as American as those Huawei sanctions nevertheless.

The timing of the Shenzhen research center also follows something of a pattern. Apple opened its first Chinese research center in 2016, which was also the year the company saw its first revenue downturn in 13 years.

“We do not have clear information about the focus of the new Apple research center in China,” says Wong. “Nevertheless, the initiative implies that China is still an important market to Apple, especially that it’s crucial to develop GenAI services that are dedicated to the local regulations and consumers’ needs.”

Those local regulations are numerous, at least compared to the light-touch, or even hands-off, approach taken to AI in the US and UK at present. At least a dozen sets of policies have been published since 2017 by various governing bodies, most notably the CAC, Cyberspace Administration of China.

“If a company wants to win in the AI era, the localized model training to inferencing, making sure of local context, partnerships, and regulations is key,” says Neil Shah of Counterpoint Research.

It is impossible for Apple to win this one on its own, though, thanks to yet another piece of Chinese legislation.

“There is still foreign investment access control, which applies to any internet-based business models. And this will mean a 50 percent maximum as foreign participation,” says Michael Tan, a partner at legal firm Taylor Wessing. He has worked on the subject of companies operating in and around China for more than two decades.

“In order to have this kind of AI feature offering for the market, you face quite a lot of regulatory hurdles, and particularly for American or foreign [companies], it could be very difficult. To arrive there they will have to team up with a local player,” says Tan. “I understand that for Apple products in that regard, they are currently talking to companies like Baidu.”

Siri, Meet Ernie

Baidu might be best described as the Chinese alternative to Google. It runs a search engine and launched its own AI assistant, Ernie, in 2019. Since then Ernie has amassed more than 300 million users, and was recently renamed to the more China-centric name of Wenxiaoyan.

Is the ghost of Ernie going to haunt Chinese iPhones? Apple may have no better choice.

“Amazon, they were more or less kicked out of the market, with their Cloud service,” says Tan, referring to Amazon’s attempted, and failed, launch of AWS (Amazon Web Services) in 2017. “If you want to run that as a full Amazon-owned business, it's not possible, so you have to team up with a local joint venture partner, as Microsoft has been doing.”

This would also be nothing new for Apple. China’s regulators began putting the squeeze on Apple as early as 2017, when new laws meant Apple’s own servers could no longer be used to run iCloud for Chinese users.

The solution was GCBD, Guizhou-Cloud Big Data, which is not just a Chinese company but a state-owned one. Seven years on, it still runs Apple’s China iCloud operations. The Chinese state is the steward of iPhone users’ emails, at least in a practical sense.

In 2021 The New York Times undertook an investigation into the compromises Apple has had to undertake to get along with the Chinese state. Those charges include compromising the security of users’ data, and the removal and barring of apps that don’t match the CCP’s content guidelines. It’s quite the read.

Tim Cook has publicly made peace with the lengths required to exist in the Chinese market.

""Your choice is: Do you participate, or do you stand on the sideline and yell at how things should be,” he said during a discussion on China during a 2017 Fortune Global Forum event. “My own view, very strongly, is you show up and you participate, you get in the arena because nothing ever changes from the sideline.”

Since then, though, the expectations of the level of Apple’s capitulation have only grown more onerous. Algorithms that determine what the public sees online or through AI have to be registered with the Chinese authorities, and new AI legislation is largely focused on controlling the exact public-interfacing models that Western tech companies want to get involved with.

“You need to file with regulators. You might need to submit a lot of details about things like coding … many tech companies may not be willing to do that,” says Tan.

The problem is, China can afford to put in place such measures because the power balance is in its favor—more so than ever.

“China is no longer just playing a following role in many technology fields,"" adds Tan. “It is already advancing and taking the leading role.”

Business as Usual?

From a Western view, the rules put in place for generative AI in China veer between the admirable and the worrying.

“The regulation includes a number of vague censorship requirements, such as that deep synthesis content ‘adhere to the correct political direction,’ not ‘disturb economic and social order,’ and not be used to generate fake news,” reads Carnegie Endowment’s paper on the state of affairs in 2023.

“Deep synthesis” is the term the CAC uses in place of generative AI. China’s restrictions would result in a Siri that wouldn’t talk about the Dalai Llama, that wouldn’t refer to Taiwan as a separate country or acknowledge the Uyghurs. And who knows what else.

Given the current lax state of Western LLMs, it’s hard enough to picture a chatbot that couldn’t be cajoled into saying China is a part of the sovereign state of Taiwan, let alone falling into line 100 percent of the time. But clearly many Chinese tech companies have managed to adhere to the restrictions, to the satisfaction of the regulators at least. In August 2024, the South China Morning Post reported 188 LLMs had been approved for use to date, up from just 14 in January 2024.

It could be argued that Apple effectively adopting a custom version of one of these LLMs to fill out China’s version of Apple Intelligence represents business as usual. Apple already censors the app store to comply with China’s policies. It already cooperates with local entities.

However, with Apple Intelligence generative AI positioned at the heart of iPhones and other devices, the company seems more at risk of being accused of being a little too embedded in the wants and whims of the Chinese state for comfort, for a US company.

In August, Zhuang Rongwen, director of the Cyberspace Administration of China, said generative AI, such as chatbots, was “forcefully driving economic and societal growth.” The New York Times’ 2021 report suggested the government didn’t really need Chinese iPhone users' data to surveil its citizens, as it already had stronger methods. But with GenAI, Apple may inadvertently become a more active participant in the CCP’s goals.",Wired,https://www.wired.com/story/apples-sales-in-china-are-stalling-what-will-it-sacrifice-to-turn-things-around/,2024-10-26 02:00:00-04:00
Delhi grapples with water woes amid heat wave ,"Mushrat Parveen, a resident of a low-income neighborhood in the Indian capital, New Delhi, perches atop a tanker truck delivering water to her neighborhood to escape the chaos that ensues.

“Everyone keeps fighting for water, so I climb on top and use a pipe to make sure I fill two or three buckets. Then I help others,” says Parveen, who in recent weeks has been spending about two hours daily first waiting for the truck, then filling containers and lugging them home.

As taps in urban slums and working-class areas in Delhi run virtually dry, millions have been depending on water ferried by government tankers. It is not the only Indian megacity running low on water. Two months ago, a similar crisis afflicted India’s information technology hub, Bengaluru.

Water shortages are not new in urban India — the scramble for water in low-income areas has been a familiar scene during summer months for many years. But they have been worsening. Amid a weekslong, searing heat wave that gripped Delhi, the city became so parched this season that police were deployed to guard water pipes.

New Delhi’s water minister, Atishi, recently staged a hunger strike for four days, alleging that the neighboring Haryana state was not providing the city its share of water from the Yamuna river that runs through both places, resulting in acute scarcity.

""There are 2.8 million people in the city who are aching for just a drop of water,” she said. Her worsening health forced her to call off the protest on Tuesday.

Political disputes over sharing of water from common rivers have often erupted when shortages intensify.

Experts say rapid urbanization is exacerbating a problem that has been building in recent years.

“What’s happened is that most Indian cities have grown so fast that the water supply networks have not kept up with the rate of growth. Its unprecedented crazy growth,” said Veena Srinivasan, executive director with non-profit WELL Labs.

The populations of Delhi and Bengaluru have more than tripled in about three decades. Delhi is now home to nearly 20 million people while Bengaluru’s population is estimated at 14 million.

These cities have become home to upscale commercial hubs and industries as India’s economy booms, requiring more quality, fresh water. As a result, lakes and rivers harnessed to provide water have been shrinking and ground water levels plummeting.

A 2018 government report said that nearly 600 million people in the country are facing high to extreme “water stress.” That adds more than 40% of the country’s population.

While upscale neighborhoods in Delhi face virtually no scarcity of clean water, experts say slums are the most parched areas in the city.

“In some places especially the lower socioeconomic areas, we find that water availability is as low as 35 to 40 liters per capita per day. So, the distribution of water is iniquitous. On top, climate change comes as a force multiplier,” said Anjal Prakash, research director at the Bharti Institute of Public Policy.

He says lack of investment in infrastructure such as water pipes and storage tanks has made the problem worse. “We have done some patchwork, but we have not done an integrated analysis of how this should be running. Delhi, for example, the leakage from the water infrastructure is about 58%.”

While India is a water-stressed country, the severe shortages cannot just be blamed on a shortfall of water, according to experts. Pointing to poor water management, they say authorities have not paid enough attention to strategies such as recycling wastewater or rainwater harvesting that would help conserve monsoon rains.

Experts say low water tariffs charged in India have also discouraged sufficient investment in schemes that could augment supplies.

“If water is free most of the time, the incentive to invest in good technology to really treat water, the incentive to harvest every last drop of rainwater, simply is not there, because it is not seen as a precious resource that is scarce. That remains a problem we have to grapple with in urban India,” points out Srinivasan.

For many Delhi residents, lives are upended by the water crisis every summer. Elderly residents like 82-year-old Kamlesh Devi say they cannot cope with the elbowing and shoving that ensues when tankers arrive.

“Four to six people come from one household and corner many buckets. Some of us keep standing. If we object, a scuffle ensues,” she says as she carries back two small containers that she will keep aside for drinking.

Ayesha Khatun, a diabetes patient relies on her family members to fetch water for cooking and cleaning because she cannot carry the buckets. “Our work gets affected. My husband sometimes loses a day’s work. My daughter has to skip school,” says Khatun. “And it is common for people to get hurt during the scuffles while filling water.”

With heat waves and water shortages likely to worsen, the situation in urban India could become grimmer, experts warn.",Voice Of America,https://www.voanews.com/a/delhi-grapples-with-water-woes-amid-heat-wave-/7674710.html,2024-06-26 16:13:26+00:00
AirPods Pro de Apple podrían ayudar a personas con problemas auditivos,"Algunos audífonos inalámbricos AirPods de Apple pueden usarse como auxiliares auditivos gracias a una nueva actualización de software disponible desde el lunes. Se trata de una medida relevante que es aplaudida por expertos, incluso si sólo llegan a una pequeña porción de los millones de estadounidenses que padecen algún grado de pérdida de audición.

Aproximadamente 30 millones de personas —1 de cada 8 estadounidenses mayores de 12 años— padecen pérdida auditiva en ambos oídos. Los dispositivos beneficiarían a millones de personas, pero la mayoría nunca los ha probado, según el Instituto Nacional de la Sordera y otros Trastornos de la Comunicación. Incontables personas más los han probado, pero no los usan debido al costo, baja calidad, no les ajustan bien, no les gusta su apariencia o por otras razones.

En los últimos cinco años ha habido un intento de cambiar eso. Hace dos años se alteraron las normativas federales para permitir que los dispositivos auditivos pudieran venderse sin necesidad de receta médica, una medida que muchos esperaban que pusiera a disposición de los pacientes mejores opciones y a menor precio. Y el mes pasado, la Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos (FDA, por sus iniciales en inglés) aprobó el software de Apple que convertiría los AirPods Pro 2 en auxiliares auditivos.

Aún se desconoce si el cambio en las normas ha sido de ayuda, afirman los expertos. Pero convertir los AirPods en auxiliares auditivos es el tipo de medida creativa que los activistas esperaban.

La pérdida auditiva puede contribuir al aislamiento, la demencia e incluso el riesgo de caídas

Aproximadamente el 15% de los estadounidenses dicen tener cierta dificultad para oír. La mayoría de las personas con pérdida auditiva tienen más de 60 años, pero los problemas de audición no sólo afectan a las personas mayores. Un estudio halló que los hombres y las personas que viven en zonas rurales son más propensos a sufrir algún grado de pérdida del oído.

El problema ha sido relacionado con muchos otros efectos sobre la salud que van más allá del oido. Contribuye al aislamiento, la depresión y el declive cognitivo, dicen expertos. Aumenta el riesgo de demencia y reconfigura el cerebro. También ha sido vinculado con un incremento en el riesgo de padecer caídas, un fuerte motivo de preocupación entre los que atienden a ancianos.

“Todo lo que hacemos, todas nuestras relaciones, ya sean personales o en nuestra vida de trabajo, involucran escuchar conversaciones”, dijo Barbara Kelley, directora ejecutiva de Hearing Loss Association of America, un organismo de apoyo a las personas que tienen este problema. “Ahora hemos descubierto que mientras más pronto se le ponga atención a su salud auditiva, mejor”.

No se necesita ir al médico para recibir un dispositivo de ayuda auditiva

Antes del cambio de reglas de la FDA en 2022, todos debían ir a un médico y recibir una receta para poder adquirir un auxiliar auditivo. Ahora están disponibles sin necesidad de receta.

“A medida que se venden más, se tiene la esperanza de que el precio baje”, dijo Elizabeth Stangl, audiologa de la Universidad de Iowa. “Pero no hemos visto que haya una gran demanda”.

Incluso al ser adquirido sin receta, un auxiliar auditivo de buena calidad fácilmente puede costar entre 400 y 500 dólares, dijo Stangl, que investiga qué tan bien se ajusta la gente a utilizar auxiliares auditivos. Y algunas de las opciones menos caras realmente sólo son “amplificadores baratos”, los cuales carecen de los controles personalizados para ajustar el nivel y características de eliminación de ruido que realmente hacen que los auxiliares auditivos sean útiles.

Apple Watch could help you uncover hidden sleep apnea,"Do you often wake up feeling exhausted, even after a full night's sleep? You might be one of the millions of people unknowingly living with sleep apnea. But here's some great news. Apple has just introduced a game-changing feature that could help you identify this hidden health issue right from your wrist.

If you own an Apple Watch Series 10, 9 or Ultra 2, you'll soon have a personal sleep detective on your arm. This new feature uses the watch's built-in technology to monitor your breathing patterns while you sleep, looking for signs that could indicate sleep apnea.

No more need for complicated sleep studies or expensive equipment; your everyday smartwatch could be the key to uncovering this common but often undiagnosed condition.

The sleep apnea detection feature utilizes the watch's built-in accelerometer to monitor a new metric called ""breathing disturbances"" during sleep. By analyzing these disturbances over time, the watch can identify patterns consistent with moderate to severe sleep apnea.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted approval for this sleep apnea feature, marking a significant milestone in wearable health technology. Apple plans to roll out the functionality to more than 150 countries and regions this month, including the United States, Europe and Japan.

You can view your nightly breathing disturbance data in the Health app on your iPhone, where it will be categorized as either ""elevated"" or ""not elevated."" The watch analyzes this data over a 30-day period and notifies users if it detects consistent signs of sleep apnea.

In clinical validation studies, the notification performance achieved a sensitivity of 66.3% and specificity of 98.5%. This means that while the algorithm is effective at identifying those with moderate to severe sleep apnea, it also minimizes false positives, ensuring that you can trust the notifications you receive.

HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET

Dr. Sumbul Desai, Apple's vice president of health, emphasized the rigorous development process behind this feature. The detection algorithm was created using advanced machine learning with extensive datasets from clinical-grade sleep apnea tests. The studies included diverse participants across various demographics and evaluated both at-home and in-lab sleeping environments.

This new feature has the potential to significantly impact public health by helping identify undiagnosed cases of sleep apnea. Research suggests that up to 80% of sleep apnea cases remain undiagnosed, making this tool invaluable for many people who may not exhibit obvious symptoms.

To use the new sleep apnea detection feature on your Apple Watch, follow these steps:

Ensure your Apple Watch is running the latest version of watchOS. Here are the steps:

Update your iPhone to the latest iOS version. Here are the steps:

Remember, this feature is designed for users 18 years or older who have not been diagnosed with sleep apnea. If you receive a notification suggesting signs of sleep apnea, it's important to consult with your health care provider for proper evaluation and diagnosis.

It’s incredible how technology can empower us to take charge of our health, and the new sleep apnea detection feature on the Apple Watch 10, 9 and Ultra 2 is a perfect example. With this tool, you can monitor your breathing patterns while you sleep, potentially uncovering issues that have gone unnoticed for far too long. Just remember, while this feature is a fantastic step toward better health, it’s essential to consult with a health care provider if you receive a notification about possible sleep apnea. Embracing these advancements could lead to a more restful night and a healthier life.

Apple is quietly stockpiling startups and hunting for talent as it fights for a slice of the AI boom,"Apple's making a big AI push, per an FT report.

The tech giant reportedly wants to run AI on iPhones directly and could launch an AI-powered Siri.

It has lagged behind rivals in this area, with Tim Cook choosing to take a cautious approach.

Apple has largely sat out of the AI arms race — but that could be about to change.

The Silicon Valley heavyweight has acquired 21 AI startups since 2017 — more than any of its rivals — according to data from PitchBook, shared with Business Insider and cited by the Financial Times.

And it's embarking on a hunt for AI talent as it seeks to catch up with rivals like Google and Microsoft.

Based on analysis of academic papers, industry data, and insights from tech sector experts, the FT report suggested that Apple is primarily focused on getting AI to run directly on its iPhones — rather than relying on massive data centers and a connection to the cloud, as services like ChatGPT do.

The tech titan is also reportedly working on a smarter, AI-powered version of its Siri voice assistant that Morgan Stanley analysts predict could launch alongside iOS 18 at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in June, the FT wrote.

Apple has also updated some of its hardware to support generative AI, unveiling more powerful M3 chips for its Macbook line in October and a new S9 chip for the Apple Watch, which allows Siri to access data without being connected to the internet.

A look at Apple's job listings shows that the company is hiring a number of roles focused on improving Siri's AI capabilities and ""enabling a better conversational experience"" with Apple's voice assistant.

They also suggest that Apple is ramping up its search for AI talent, advertising AI-focused jobs across several areas, including health, on-device AI, and building ""foundation models,"" which are baseline AI models like GPT-4.

A recent research note from Morgan Stanley, cited by the FT, found that nearly half of the company's AI job postings are now focused on ""Deep Learning,"" a type of machine learning that is integral to building large language models like ChatGPT.

Apple last year reportedly developed its own GPT-4 rival, a large language model called ""Ajax"" that employees have used to create an internal chatbot service.

The company pumped money $22.61 billion into research and development in the first half of last year — an increase CEO Tim Cook said was partly down to Apple's focus on generative AI.

Apple was largely caught off guard by the astonishing success of ChatGPT in late 2022, with one insider at the company telling Bloomberg that the lack of response was considered ""a pretty big miss internally.""

The company has taken a cautious approach to the new technology even as rivals like Google and Microsoft have launched a number of new AI products.

In a May 2023 earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook described the AI boom as ""huge"" for the tech industry, but cautioned that the tech titan would be ""deliberate and thoughtful"" in how it incorporated the technology into its products.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider, made outside normal working hours.

iOS 18: Discover new features in Apple's latest operating system,"Apple has released the latest version of its iOS operating system, iOS 18. The company first showcased the OS during WWDC 2024 in June and began rolling it out to iPhones on Sept. 16.

In many ways, iOS 18 can be considered the biggest iOS update in a while as it introduces big changes in design, features and overall usability.

The iPhone 15 Pros and the new iPhone 16 models also pack some artificial intelligence features you won’t find on other iPhones. I’ll walk you through some of the key iOS 18 features you should know about.

Before you read about the features, it’s important to know if your iPhone will get the newest iOS update. Below is the list of iPhones eligible for the iOS 18 update.

IOS 18 is a massive update with tons of improvements and new features. I’m not going to dive into every single one, but here are eight of my favorites. I’ve been using some of them for a while now, since I was part of the beta program, which gave me early access.

If you’ve been using iPhones for a while, you know Apple hasn’t given you much control over how things look on screen. That changes now with iOS 18 as the company has introduced several new features that let you personalize your iPhone’s Home Screen.

You can now freely place app icons and widgets anywhere within the Home Screen grid. This is something Android users have been flexing on iPhone users about for quite some time. In a way, it makes your iPhone feel a lot more personalized.

Apple is also letting you change the color of your apps and widgets on the Home Screen. You can switch between light and dark mode, and the icons will adjust accordingly if the app has a dark mode icon available.

This major update to Photos enhances the ease of finding and reliving special moments. The elegant, streamlined layout presents the library with a unified yet familiar view. New collections such as Recent Days, People & Pets, and Trips use on-device intelligence to automatically organize the library, allowing you to spend less time searching and more time enjoying your memories. You can also personalize your experience with a customizable layout that highlights what matters most to you and pin favorite collections for quick access.

There are some apps you might want to keep on your phone but don’t want others to know about. With iOS 18, iPhone users can now lock any app behind Face ID, Touch ID or a passcode, ensuring no one can open the app without your authentication. If you want to take things a step further, you can use the hiding feature.

When you hide an app, it won’t appear in your app library or search results. You won’t receive any notifications from the app unless you open the dedicated hidden folder from the app library. The only way to access this folder is by using Face ID, Touch ID or a passcode.

Apple has added some cool new features to the Messages app. You can now use text effects for specific words in your messages, with options like big, small, shake, nod, explode, ripple, bloom and jitter. Plus, there are new formatting options that are a lot like what you’d find in Google Docs or Microsoft Word.

The Messages app also gets an upgraded Tapback system, so you can react to messages with a wider range of emojis or stickers, not just the Apple-approved ones from before. Another new feature is scheduling, which lets you set messages to be sent at a later time.

Siri, Apple’s virtual assistant, has been pretty limited so far. It often just points you to Apple’s website or insists on searching the web for almost every question. However, with iOS 18, Apple is giving Siri a major AI upgrade. The new Siri will be able to handle more complex questions and remember what you say, kind of like ChatGPT.

Apple also says Siri will be able to see what’s on your screen and help with any questions you have. Plus, it’ll be able to find specific messages, pictures or files. For example, you could ask Siri to locate the email you received from your colleague about the project last month or show you the recipe you saved for your favorite pasta dish.

However, the new Siri won’t be available with the initial iOS 18 release. Apple says the upgrade is still a work in progress and will be coming either near the end of the year or at the beginning of 2025.

The Control Center gets a new multipage layout with a Controls Gallery where third-party developers can add their own widgets. You can even swap the new controls onto the lock screen, replacing the flashlight and camera icons.

Apple has also introduced a new API that lets third-party apps add controls to the revamped Control Center. For example, Apple has shown how the Ford app will use this API to let you start your vehicle, open the trunk and more right from the Control Center.

You won’t really notice or get much out of RCS if most of your friends and family use iPhones. RCS is designed to improve texting between iPhone and Android devices.

It’s an upgrade from SMS/MMS. It adds things like typing indicators, delivery and read receipts, higher-quality photos and videos, and the ability to text over Wi-Fi or mobile data instead of just relying on your carrier's network. It also makes it easier to manage group chats, like letting you leave conversations.

With iOS 18, Apple has made it easier for iPhones and Macs to work together. The new iPhone Mirroring feature lets you control your iPhone directly from your Mac by showing your iPhone’s screen on your Mac. You can use your Mac’s mouse, keyboard and trackpad to manage iPhone apps, check notifications and more. This feature will basically create a digital version of your iPhone on your Mac.

Most of the AI features under Apple Intelligence won’t be available with the initial iOS 18 release. As I mentioned earlier, these will roll out in later iOS 18 updates, possibly at the end of this year or early 2025. However, the features I talked about earlier will be ready right after you install the iOS 18 update, except for the upgraded Siri.

To keep your phone up to date, you can turn on automatic updates. Just go to the Software Update screen, click on ""Automatic Updates"" and switch on all the services you want to update automatically.

iOS 18 is an exciting upgrade with lots of improvements for your iPhone. You can personalize your phone and use cool features like iPhone Mirroring to better connect with your other Apple devices. The Messages app now includes fun effects to spice up your texting experience. However, it’s a bit disappointing that the Apple Intelligence features, which have been hyped since WWDC, won’t be available right away with the initial release.

Christina Applegate Wants 'Shots With Cher' With 'Days I Have Left',"The actress has been candid about her battle with multiple sclerosis and previously said she was diagnosed in 2021

In the summer of 2021, Christina Applegate revealed that she had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Since then, she has been candid about her experience and raising awareness about the autoimmune disease, and on Tuesday, the actress shared some things she’d like to do “with the days I have left in life.”

In a post shared to X, Applegate wrote, “There are things I want to do with the days I have left in life,” adding, “I want to work with Shirley MacLaine And do shots with cher! And yes my days are so big. Just saying.”

Applegate has previously voiced her admiration for MacLaine — the multiple award-winning actress behind Terms of Endearment, Coco Chanel, Steel Magnolias, and more recently, featuring in Downton Abbey and Only Murders in the Building. “I wish I could work with Shirley MacLaine That’s all. Woke up and that dream I have had for my whole life, washed over me,” the Dead to Me actress wrote on social media in June. “And I wept for a minute. And I’m sure I will again. Oh and Shirley, I don’t have your number anymore so…….”

The beloved actress received a standing ovation at the Emmy Awards in January, where she presented the award for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy. In a moment of levity, Applegate joked: “You’re totally shaming me, with a disability, by standing up — it’s fine!”

This year, she launched the podcast, MeSsy, with co-host Jamie-Lynn Sigler (who revealed in 2016 that she was diagnosed with MS when she was 20) to discuss their shared struggles with MS and help others in the process.",Rolling Stone,https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/christina-applegate-cher-shirley-maclaine-ms-battle-1235053269/,2024-07-04 02:59:32+00:00
Apple could face billions in fines under European Union law ,"Billions of dollars in fines could be imposed on Apple following an accusation of noncompliance from the European Commission on Monday.

Apple is accused of breaking the European Union’s Digital Marketing Act (DMA) rules on digital competition via its app store by inhibiting app makers from promoting cheaper alternatives. The European Commission claimed in a preliminary review that the app store “prevent[s] app developers from freely steering consumers to alternative channels for offers and content.""

The commission cited a “core technology fee” on the App Store as cause for a potential DMA violation. The fee charges 54 cents to app developers every time their app is downloaded from somewhere outside the Apple-owned digital marketplace. There is concern that the fee will dissuade developers from using other apps.

To expand competition in the EU’s 27 nations the DMA requires some of the biggest tech companies in the world, also referred to as “gatekeepers,” to expand competition. Apple is the first tech firm to be formally accused by the commission under the law, which went into effect on March 7.

The commission also opened probes against Google and Meta in March.

The DMA would allow the commission to impose daily penalties of up to 5% of Apple's global revenues. The commission could also enforce fines of up to 10% of the tech company’s overall worldwide turnover.

For repeat offenders, the 10% fine could increase to as much as 20%. In extreme cases of violation, the commission has the authority to break up companies.

Apple claims to have made changes to comply with feedback from the European Commission and said it would continue.

Due to the probe, the commission announced the closing of an antitrust case opened against Apple in 2020 into whether the tech firm violated Brussels' antitrust rules. The commission said it shut down that case “to avoid multiple investigations into the very same conduct.”

The commission will have a decision on Apple’s compliance by March of 2025. The outcome of the probe could change how the App Store functions within the EU.

Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse.",Voice Of America,https://www.voanews.com/a/apple-s-app-store-rules-breach-eu-tech-rules-eu-regulators-say/7667644.html,2024-06-24 09:22:41+00:00
"Apple is pivoting to a less ambitious design for its autonomous EV amid launch delays, report says","Apple is pivoting to a less ambitious design for its autonomous EV, Bloomberg reported.

The company is downgrading the vehicle to Level 2+ autonomy, the report said.

Apple's EV plans have already suffered several delays.

Apple appears to be learning that making EVs is no simple feat.

The tech giant is pivoting to a less complex design and delaying the launch date for its planned autonomous vehicle, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the situation.

Following board meetings, the company has limited the car's autonomous features and downgraded the EV to Level 2+ autonomy, Bloomberg reported. Apple had previously planned to build a fully driverless car.

Level 2 autonomous cars can provide features that very briefly allow drivers to take their hands off the wheel, including adaptive cruise control, self-parking features, and lane-centering control. Most autonomous cars available peak at Level 2, although Mercedes-Benz gained approval for Level 3 automated driving systems late last year, Forbes reported.

Apple's EV release date has also been pushed back, with the company expecting a 2028 launch at the very earliest, the Bloomberg report said. Earlier targets included 2026 and 2024.

Representatives for Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider, made outside normal working hours. The company declined to comment when reached by Bloomberg.

Apple's foray into the EV market has been in the works for some time, with a previous production date aiming for this year, Reuters reported in 2020.

The tech giant will likely face stiff competition from rival EV companies when it finally brings its product to market. Its most formidable competitors will likely be Tesla and China's BYD, both of which dominate the global EV market.

Prime Day Apple AirPods Deal: Up to 32% Discount on Amazon,"Prime Day might be over, but members can also get AirPods Pro (3rd Gen) and the AirPods Max for steep discounts

When Apple rolled out its AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) a few years back, the famed tech brand changed the earbud game for itself, outfitting the high-tech earbuds with improved active noise cancelation, better battery life, and upgraded touch and volume controls. While the latest iteration of the Apple AirPods Pro normally cost upwards of $249 at retail, Apple die-hards can get the buds for as low as $169 following Prime Day 2024 — an $80 savings and 32% discount.

It was one of the best Prime Day tech deals we’d seen for Prime Day 2024, and it’s luckily still going strong. (Don’t have an Amazon Prime subscription yet? New members can get a Prime membership with a 30-day free trial to test out the service, and still score deals like the Apple AirPods Pro discount before it’s gone.)

More Apple Earbuds + Headphones Deals

While the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) deal is worth it if you’re in the market for excellent noise-cancelling earbuds, it’s hardly the only post-Prime Day Apple AirPods deal you should pay attention to while you’re scrolling. This week, Apple fans can also find the audio giant’s AirPods (3rd Gen) and Apple AirPods Max (the brand’s over-ear headphones) all discounted on Amazon (while the promotions last).

You can also score the Apple AirPods (2nd Gen) for a 38% discount, bringing their price down to as low as $79.99 on Amazon. The previous versions of the AirPods come with their own charging case and boast up to 24 hours of battery.

The third-generation AirPods, meantime, are currently 29% off following the Prime Day 2024 sales event, bringing their price down to $119.99 (from $169). The sweat- and water-resistant buds support spatial audio and offer up to 30 hours of battery life with their case.

If you’ve already gotten your fix of earbuds but you’re shopping for noise-cancelling headphones, you can’t go wrong with Apple AirPods Max cans, now on sale for $394.99, the cheapest price we’ve seen them in recent months. Normally retailing for $549, the Amazon deal gets you the top-rated AirPods Max for 28% off online.

We regularly use the AirPods Max during the work day and on walks and recommend them for both music and podcasts alike. They boast a comfortable fit and stellar noise-canceling sound — one of the best over-ear headphones we’ve worn this year.

"Trump Officials Seized Apple Data of 2 Democratic Lawmakers, NY Times Says","Prosecutors in the U.S. Justice Department under former president Donald Trump seized data from Apple from two Democratic lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee, as well as that of their staff and family members, The New York Times reported Thursday.

Subpoenas for the communications metadata targeted congressman Adam Schiff of California, a Trump foe who was then the panel's top Democrat and now its chairman, the paper said.

Congressman Eric Swalwell told CNN on Thursday he was the second Democratic lawmaker on the committee who was targeted.

""I was notified... by Apple that they did seize my records. It's wrong,"" he said.

According to the Times, prosecutors working under attorney general Jeff Sessions made unusual efforts in 2017 and early 2018 to find the source of leaks of classified information regarding contacts between Trump associates and Russia.

The Justice Department officials targeted electronic data not only of the lawmakers, but that of their staff and families, including one minor, possibly because investigators thought the lawmakers were using their associates' or children's devices to hide contacts with journalists.

Ultimately, none of the data or other evidence tied the lawmakers or the House Intelligence Committee to the leaks, the Times said.

Schiff, while not confirming he was a target of the investigation, called for a probe by the Justice Department's inspector general into ""this and other cases that suggest the weaponization of law enforcement by a corrupt president.""

Trump ""tried to use the Department as a cudgel against his political opponents and members of the media. It is increasingly apparent that those demands did not fall on deaf ears,"" Schiff said in a statement.

Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi also called for an investigation, describing the New York Times report as ""harrowing.""

""These actions appear to be yet another egregious assault on our democracy waged by the former president,"" she said in a statement.",Voice Of America,https://www.voanews.com/a/usa_us-politics_trump-officials-seized-apple-data-2-democratic-lawmakers-ny-times-says/6206890.html,2021-06-11 07:16:03+00:00
Apple's iPhone is the bestselling smartphone in China despite stiff competition from local competitor Huawei ,"Apple's iPhone was the bestselling smartphone in China for the first time last year.

Apple had a record market share of 17.3% in 2023, International Data Corporation figures showed.

The company has faced difficulties in China after a renewed local interest in rival Huawei.

The iPhone became the bestselling smartphone in China for the first time last year.

Apple captured the top spot with a record-high market share of 17.3% in 2023, figures from the International Data Corporation showed.

Local competitor Huawei trailed behind Apple's 20% market share in Q4 with 13.9% of the market share in the year's final quarter, per the data.

Apple has faced difficulties in China recently. Last year, Apple CEO Tim Cook made two trips to China in an attempt to defend the company's position in the important international market.

Sales of its newest model, the iPhone 15, have been disappointing compared with previous iterations after a renewed local interest in domestic rival Huawei put pressure on the tech giant.

Huawei previously outpaced Apple's iPhone 15 with its Mate 60 Pro smartphone, released just weeks before Apple's new model, Jefferies analysts said.

""Apple's climb to the top spot in 2023, especially in light of renewed competition from Huawei and the soft spending sentiment, marks a tremendous success for Apple,"" Arthur Guo, senior research analyst for IDC China, said.

""Apple achieved this thanks to timely price promotions in its third-party channels, which stimulated demand,"" he said.

The entire Chinese market saw smartphone sales slump to their lowest in a decade in China, stemming from a soft economic recovery and weak consumer sentiment.

Preliminary data from the IDC Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker showed that China smartphone shipments totaled 271.3 million units in 2023, a decline of 5.0% from 2022.

Representatives Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider, made outside normal working hours.

"Wisconsin field trip children, adults injured in tractor and wagon accident at apple orchard","A field trip at a Wisconsin apple orchard soured after at least 17 people, including children, were injured following a tractor rollover.

In a press conference Wednesday afternoon, Chippewa Fire District's Deputy Chief Corey Jeffers said that two hay wagons that were being pulled by a tractor rolled over at the Bushel and a Peck Apple Orchard in Lafayette, Wisconsin.

Jeffers said that three patients were transported with life-threatening injuries, five with serious injuries, and nine others were transported by ambulance. One patient was airlifted, and others were taken to the hospital in personal vehicles.

Authorities did not share the specifics of the injuries.

In a statement on social media, Chippewa County Sheriff Travis Hakes said that several children along with their parents and chaperons were on the wagon ride through the orchard when the incident occurred.

Hakes said that the wagon lost control while going downhill and when they tried to stop it, it abruptly overturned.

""During incidents like these, it is imperative that we focus on the safety of the victims, as well as reunification efforts between the children and their parents,"" he said. ""I personally went to the scene and assisted in calming the children, as well as reuniting them with their parents.""",Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/us/wisconsin-field-trip-children-adults-injured-tractor-wagon-accident-apple-orchard,2024-09-19 00:22:00-04:00
Apple begins testing AI software designed to bring a smarter Siri to the iPhone 16,"Apple is giving more people the chance to test a software update that will implant artificial intelligence into its virtual assistant Siri and automate a variety of tedious tasks on the latest iPhone coming out Friday.

The free update was made available Thursday to an audience that has signed up to test Apple’s software before it’s released to all iPhone owners next month. As of Thursday, only two premium iPhones that came out last year contain the souped-up processor required to power the AI features included in the update, but that will change Friday when four new iPhone 16 models reach store shelves.

All the iPhone 16 models, with starting prices ranging from $800 to $1,200, are equipped to handle the new technology, which the company is marketing as “Apple Intelligence.” That branding is part of an effort to distinguish the iPhone’s AI from similar technology already available in smartphones released earlier this year by Samsung and Google.

The AI features are being promoted as one of the main reasons to buy an iPhone 16, so releasing a test version of the software powering the technology now may prod more consumers to splurge on one of the new models as soon as possible

The AI technology is coming out in U.S. English only for now, but will expand into localized English in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the U.K. in December. Apple plans to expand into other languages and countries next year. The testing of the AI software is beginning just a few days after Apple released its latest mobile operating system, iOS 18, to all its earlier iPhones.

Once the iOS 18.1 upgrade is installed, the often bumbling Siri is supposed to become more conversational, versatile and colorful, with a glowing light that will rotate around the iPhone’s screen as it responds to requests. While Apple is promising Siri will be able to perform more tasks and be less prone to becoming confused, it won’t be able to interact with other apps installed on the iPhone until another software update comes out at a still-unspecified date.

Other AI features in the software update will handle a variety of writing and proofreading tasks, summarize the content of emails and other documents. The AI also will provide a variety of editing tools to alter the appearance of photos and make it easier to find old pictures.

But the initial update doesn’t include other AI tricks still to come, such as the ability to create customized emojis on the fly or conjure other fanciful imagery upon request. Apple also plans to eventually enable its AI suite to get a helping hand from OpenAI’s ChatGPT when users want it.

Besides the new iPhone model, Apple’s AI features also will work last year’s iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max because they have the special computer chip that’s required. The update will also bring the ability to record spatial video on those two iPhone 15 models that can be watched on Apple’s $3,500 Vision Pro headset.

But the AI won’t work on hundreds of millions of other iPhones that are still in use, a drawback that investors are betting will juice Apple’s recently slumping sales of the ubiquitous device.

That expectation is the main reason that Apple’s stock price has climbed by more than 15% since the company previewed its AI strategy in June, creating $500 billion in shareholder wealth. Some analysts believe the demand for new iPhones could propel Apple’s market value above $4 trillion for the first time within the next year.",Associated Press News,https://apnews.com/article/apple-artificial-intelligence-iphone-16-siri-3bbf16e06e29f09320dcbefcf4ffc40b,2024-09-19 19:26:00+00:00
How to Remove and Replace Your AirTag’s Battery,"Is your Apple AirTag running low on power? Here’s how to replace that battery and get back to tracking.

Look, you’re probably here because you recently received an iPhone notification that the battery for your AirTag is running low. Or, maybe you purchased a refurbished version of Apple’s tracking device and want to make sure it has plenty of juice to last for a while. Either way, I’m here to assure you that replacing an AirTag battery is simple. The whole process should take only a couple of minutes.

How often do you need to replace it? After activating a brand-new AirTag, you can expect to replace that first battery in about a year. The timing of subsequent replacements really depends on the quality of the batteries you purchase, as well as how much you use the tracker. Unlike the iPhone or Apple Watch, the battery in an AirTag is not rechargeable and needs to be swapped out when it dies.

Thankfully, you don’t have to buy some special battery from Apple. Most lithium CR2032 coin batteries will work just fine. These are the same 3-volt batteries that commonly slot into wristwatches, kitchen thermometers, and other small electronics. A four-pack of the batteries costs around $6 on Amazon.

Just know that some of these CR2032 batteries have been treated with a bitter coating to discourage children from swallowing them. Not all of those bitter-tasting batteries will work with AirTags, so if yours has this coating, make sure to double-check the packaging to see if it’s compatible. The coated batteries that do work will clearly say “Compatible With Apple AirTag” on the package.

Swap It Out

Now that you have a new battery for your AirTag, removing the old battery and adding in the fresh one is simple. Follow these steps:

Would you rather have a rechargeable tracker on your keyring or attached to your pet? While the AirTag is WIRED’s recommended tracker for iOS devices, the Pebblebee might be worth checking out for a tracker where you can use a USB-C cord to charge it and avoid changing those pesky little battery cells.

"Apple's 'Private Relay' Will Not Be Available in China, Elsewhere ","Apple on Monday said a new ""private relay"" feature designed to obscure a user's web browsing behavior from internet service providers and advertisers will not be available in China for regulatory reasons.

The feature was one of a number of privacy protections Apple announced at its annual software developer conference Monday.

It will also be unavailable in Belarus, Colombia, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkmenistan, Uganda and the Philippines, Apple said.

The ""private relay"" feature first sends web traffic to a server maintained by Apple, where it is stripped of its IP address. From there, Apple sends the traffic to a second server maintained by a third-party operator who assigns the user a temporary IP address and sends the traffic onward to its destination website.

The use of an outside party in the second hop of the relay system is intentional, Apple said, to prevent even Apple from knowing both the user's identity and what website the user is visiting.

Apple has not yet disclosed which outside partners it will use in the system but said it plans to disclose them in the future. The feature will not likely become available to the public until later this year.",Voice Of America,https://www.voanews.com/a/silicon-valley-technology_apples-private-relay-will-not-be-available-china-elsewhere/6206759.html,2021-06-08 01:31:59+00:00
