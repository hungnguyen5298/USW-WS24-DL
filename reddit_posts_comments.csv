0,How are activist short sellers not committing insider trading,"It seems like they gain access to material non-public information, slowly build their case, then take a large short position before publishing all gathered information. How is that not insider trading?

I previously posted this question in r/Trading but nobody knew the answer and most people confused insider trading with being a company insider. I hope I have better luck here",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gyxil8/how_are_activist_short_sellers_not_committing/,"['If they hired people to look at satellite imagery to count trucks at a factory to figure out that sales are not as good as management is saying, that is totally legal.

Maybe you just didn't like it.\xa0"", ""You couldn't do it with cars so short sellers are less regulated than car salesmen."", 'They’re not insiders.  Inside information is getting a tip from the ceo at the golf club.', 'Got it! I wonder if where that fine line is between spending resources to gain information not available to the average joe and gaining information that is normally only available to sinsiders', 'I actually haven’t received this answer. Most people said that short sellers cannot commit insider trading because they are not insiders of that company', 'Whether or not the information was attainable by a member of the general public. \n\nIf you can figure it out using public IP, even if it requires digging it’s fair game.', 'Reposting a comment I made last week on this very subject...\n\n\n>There is a serious legal bar between ""difficult to find"" and ""nonpublic."" ""Nonpublic"" implies a confidentiality requirement to keep the information private, such as what officers of a corporation might have. They are free to trade on information they come across because it is material but not nonpublic. Let\'s illustrate this with a few examples.\n\n>If an analyst for an investment bank calls an executive at a company and asks specific questions about the company\'s upcoming earnings, and the executive answers 1) honestly, 2) without suggesting a quid pro quo and 3) without requiring a promise of confidentiality and non-use from the analyst; then the analyst is free to use that data for personal gain, because legally the executive has effectively made this information public. There is a legal grey area of an executive giving information without that requirement, then calling the analyst up and trying to enforce confidentiality after the fact, but that\'s really an edge case and isn\'t relevant here.\n\n>If I am employed at a semiconductor company and in the course of my professional work I discover that a publicly traded company lost a huge contract, and I lead the way to securing that contract for my company, then 1) it is illegal for me to trade my own company\'s stock in response (I am an insider and have a confidentiality relationship), but 2) it is perfectly legal for me to short that other company, because I have no confidentiality relationship with them (assuming my employer doesn\'t restrict this, which they might - read your NDAs carefully.)\n\n>If your work involves heading out to solar panel fields to repair them, and you\'ve been all over the country and draw certain well-founded conclusions about the health of a company that manufactures these things, yes, you are allowed to trade on that data legally (again, in the absence of another employment agreement requiring that you do not, which establishes confidentiality). If your company is set to profit from this, no, you can\'t trade your own company\'s stock - that generally constitutes illegal inside trading.\n\n>If I am sitting in a Starbucks and I overhear two executives who happen to be talking about their companies merging, and this information has not yet been released to the public, I am allowed to trade on this information. The information was obtained in a public setting without a covenant of confidentiality established prior to my discovery. Conversely, if I see them in the Starbucks and bribe them for information, I am not allowed to trade on the information, because I established a quid pro quo with people who do have a confidentiality relationship.\n\n>Insider trading is extremely nuanced and extremely widely misunderstood. It is so misunderstood and so nuanced, that Matt Levine (a columnist at Bloomberg who writes ""Money Stuff"") has a habit of writing about all the weird developments in insider trading case law and odd edge cases that come up, because they\'re complex enough to make a frequent appearance in a finance column. The media (as an aggregate group reporting on this subject) has fixated on the idea that Congress is exempt from insider trading, but that is not factual. It doesn\'t help that there is a strong ideological sentiment against the finance industry which, regardless of whether or not it\'s well-founded (I\'m not going to comment on that), somewhat muddies the water when laypeople are looking for legitimate misconduct; this is especially prevalent when combined with the fact that most people simply don\'t understand what Wall Street does aside from the odd picture of a bunch of guys yelling in the middle of an exchange floor here and there (it does quite a lot!). As an academic concept in the legal and financial spheres, insider trading and mundane research could be thought of as a Venn diagram with some, but not total (nor even majority) overlap. The public conception of insider trading is that anything you find out in a professional context that, say, your friends and family don\'t know is illegal to use. This is made worse by the portrayal of insider trading in movies and television - that\'s absolutely not the case.', 'With this current Supreme Court, that might be the case. 🙄']"
1,Speculate on GOOG - what'd be the best countermove against DoJ slaps? ,"For those who were sleeping/partying on the weekend, the following happened:

* DoJ said, Google should divest off Chrome and may not reenter the browser market for five years
* prohibited from ""acquiring any interests in search rivals, potential entrants, and rival search or search ads-related AI products""
* halt all ""anticompetitive payments to distributors, including Apple, Samsung"" so that Google isn't the default search engine on their devices
* content creators can choose to opt-out of Google crawlers to train its AI

Most obvious historical comparison is case against Microsoft Corp. in 2001; the DoJ tried to split Microsoft up due to its hold over the web browser market on Windows, though this case **ultimately resulted in a settlement**. With that in mind, it is possible, the DoJ will go this way, this time.

* Search is close to 50% revenue of Google \[Q3 results\]
* Browsers market shares: Chrome 60%, Safari 18%, Edge 8% \[Source can be contested, because it's larger devices stats only\]
* Android - 70% market share in handheld devices

GOOG has to fight hard to ensure a high search traffic. It may have a few options up its sleeves.



||||
|:-|:-|:-|
|""Chrome"" as a stand-alone listed company like Opera browser.|Possibly the worst move. Average user unlikely to install a browser-only app, than stick with factory default browser on the device. ||
|Chrome+Gemini as a new company, to command an ""AI"" valuation.|Not likely to attract advertisers, until this new 'app' gets wild Chat-GPT like popularity. ||
|Android+Chrome as a new company, provides operating system for device manufacturers|Won't make sense, because Samsung already has their prop. version of Android. And to gain search traffic, Google again needs to partner with this new company, which is prohibited.||
|A company with ""personal suite"" of applications, Gmail, Calendar, Docs and Chrome bundled together|Chrome then gets 100's million users from Day-1. Still, above legal prohibition remains. ||
|Settlement|Make it all go away!||

Any other speculations? With so much uncertainty, the stock will remain under pressure with downward bias, until there's clarity on the case.

But at PE 22, even if total revenue of the demerged companies, takes a hit of 30%, it's still a great value.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gywuwe/speculate_on_goog_whatd_be_the_best_countermove/,"['Google: Starts negotiations to sell Chrome to Alibaba. DOJ: Wait a minute…', 'The issue is that nobody else can buy chrome lol.

And a possible spin-off would not be an expropriation, but would happen in return for massive financial compensation for Alphabet or result in shares in the new holding company for current shareholders. And I know that Chrome is part of the Google ecosystem. But as long as Google exists, a separate mobile browser is not essential.\n\nBut thats just speculating about what happens in the absolute worst case scenario if Chrome is split off. \n\nMuch more realistic to me is that the scope of what the Biden DOJ is currently calling for will be massively reduced once Trump takes office in January. Firstly, he has said that he would find it „unfair“ to split up Google, secondly, it does not fit in with his „America First“ doctrine to destroy one of the 10 or so companies that keep the USA globally relevant and thirdly, Matt Gaetz will not even become Attorney General in the Trump cabinet.

Thank you DOJ!', 'OpenAI could buy Chrome for more data and to put ChatGPT on every device that is running Chrome.', ""Yeah, I can't think of a company that can buy Chrome that wouldn't have similar monopoly issues. Plus, Chromium is open source, so it wouldn't be that difficult for Google to simply start a new browser unless the ruling forbids them from doing so.\n\nSo I'm not sure how selling Chrome is realistic or helpful when it comes to stopping monopolies. Similarly, while forbidding Alphabet from paying to make Google the default search engine on other platforms makes sense on paper, the result might be to kill or at very least severely hinder Chrome's only major non-Chromium competitor because Firefox heavily relies on those payments from Google.\n\nAllowing users to opt-out of AI training and prohibiting Google from acquiring rival companies seems like good moves though, if the objective is to at least contain Google's dominance. I could see those happening.\n\nUltimately, I'm wondering how much Google's search business will end up impacted by the rise of ChatGPT, especially with OpenAI also dipping directly into search. I know Google has Gemini, but ChatGPT still appears to have the edge in consumers' minds. Keeping Microsoft as the comparison, I could see us entering an era post-Microsoft DOJ where Microsoft escaped intact, but it found itself in a diminished position anyway because while it continued to dominate the PC-business in terms of OS, it mattered less as people shifted increasingly to phones and Microsoft gradually found itself as an also-ran in that space. Of course, Microsoft eventually emerged from that stronger than ever, but there was a long period of Microsoft looking like a shell of its former self. \n\nGoogle might go through a similar period as a result of AI, especially because, like Microsoft at that time, consumer perception of Google is extremely low. That doesn't always matter because we've seen time and again that consumers will put up with a company they don't like if they're used to using their products, but it also makes them more willing to jump to a competitor if said competitor offers something that seems just as good or better, and the transition won't inconvenience the consumer. A negative feeling towards a company also makes consumers less willing to expand the number of products from that company they're using, which will perhaps work against Google as they try to compete in the AI space.\n\nOf course, Google has mountains of money and resources, so writing them off is risky."", 'I thought they wanted Google to split from chrome, not sell it.\n\nAs in: chrome becomes an independent company.', 'Microsoft never has a monopoly', 'G has a very low P/E when compared to emerging tech market companies in quantum computing, self-driving, AI infrastructure, and AI chat.

3,Evaluation of Companies with Down Revenue,"I find this an interesting topic and am interested how others feel if a company would be considered potentially bullish with the following fundamentals.

- Cash flow per share growth (year over year)
- Net income growth (year over year)
- Lower long-term debt (year over year)

BUT ALSO HAS…

- Lower revenue (year over year)
- Lower net income (year over year)
- Lower earnings per share (year over year)

In my opinion when revenue (or net income) is declining, and not flat or increasing, it is a concern that the company could be on the brink of a big downturn. Especially in a continued pattern of these results.

However, I often see companies with these symptoms, (sometimes in different combinations but at least two of these are lower year over year), however the chart is very bullish at times…

6,Delaware Funds by Macquarie,"Does anyone have any insight into Delaware Funds managed by Macquarie? 

Unfortunately, I was persuaded to purchase into one of the small / mid cap mutual funds in December 2020. Obviously the market was on a bit of a run there, but everything about the fund (historical build up, Morningstar ratings, length of existence of the fund, recommendations by publications, YoY performance,  etc) led me to believe it was a reasonable, if somewhat more aggressive, investment.  

It was all well and good for about a year, as the market rebounded from Covid and this particular fund hummed along with the rest of the economy.   Articles like [this in the mainstream press](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/4-stock-picks-for-the-post-pandemic-nesting-economy-from-a-five-star-money-manager-11636995166?mod=bnbh_mwarticle) lent further credence that the fund was solid and the fund managers respected by financial journalism. 

And then it did a capital gains distribution (historically very normal for this fund) in December 2021 and then the share price immediately started its plummet.  Like, overnight, lost $15/share.  Similarly, it went seemingly overnight from a Morningstar 5 rating to a 2 rating.  It continued to fall from there. 

  
I guess I am one of those silly buy and hold people.  I always assume that short term losses will eventually be made up in the long term.  Since then....no. 

  
Earlier this year, Delaware merged a couple of their funds, so DFDIX became IYMIX.   As far as I can tell, the holdings in IYMIX are not radically different than what DFDIX held.   In a market that has been turbo charged for the past year, the growths of this fund have been glacial.   I realize that the holdings are small / mid cap and those are ostensibly still being knocked around by high interest rates, but the three years since that initial freefall following the capital gains distribution has not really begun to make up the ground that the fund dramatically lost. 

I've literally never been in a mutual fund that actively lost money for me.  Plenty have not grown in dramatic ways, but actually halving of value?  That's never happened before. 

Does anyone have any insight into this investment company or explanation why a small / midcap fund would depreciate to such a dramatic extent and fail to recover over a period of years when stock market growth is explosive? 

  
I'm a little heartsick at the thought of just cutting losses and investing in Vanguard or something but it's been really stressful.  

Thanks in advance.

8,Games Workshop up 15% following higher than expected quarterly sales!,"A few months ago I posted about Games Workshop and why I thought it was undervalued.  
TLDR: the new Space Marine II game was a hit and this would drive increased sales.

I posted about it here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g6lt1l/games\_workshop\_hold\_or\_sell/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g6lt1l/games_workshop_hold_or_sell/)  
In the end, I decided to hold (thank God!)

Today GW announced significantly higher-than-expected quarterly sales, resulting in a 15% bump in stock price.

By losing very little principal during drawdowns, it avoids the ""[volatility tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_tax)"" that crushes your long-term CAGR. In its original 1999 incarnation, the portfolio was divided according to this rubric:\n\n* 25% equities (can be represented by SPY)\n* 25% long-term bonds (can be represented by TLT)\n* 25% gold (can be represented by GLD)\n* 25% cash (can be represented by SHY or a savings account)\n\nRay Dalio\'s twist on it during the 2000s was to apply external leverage to juice returns. The original\'s Sharpe ratio was 0.6 and Dalio pushed it back up to 1, accruing better ROI with the same volatility as SPY. Recently Porter Stansberry introduced his version which is predicated on internal leverage and filtering criteria for equities. The actual details behind his version are too long for this post, but the idea of internal leverage^1 to increase returns without increasing risk exposure has been bouncing around in my mind. \n\nFor the last six months I\'ve been theorycrafting a barbell portfolio whose short end can be converted to produce high convexity returns during a market drawdown. The key word here is *converted*: I was looking for a bond substitute that was liquid enough to be turned into a security with non-linear returns on short notice. During period of crisis for the bond market, long-term securities can become extremely illiquid as the buyer side dries up. In such instances you are stuck with a ""risk free"" asset that\'s rapidly depreciating in value. Simultaneously I wanted to avoid the main issue with relying on the Sharpe ratio - it forces your CAGR to converge with the general market during good times. We want a setup that outperforms when the market\'s hot and offers better principal protection when it\'s cold. \n\nAfter doing some research and crunching numbers since the beginning of May, I arrived at the following portfolio:\n\n* 30% equities, replacing SPY with high-quality companies adhering to strict criteria.\n* 30% gold and other precious/industrial metals, leveraged through exposure to high-quality companies adhering to strict criteria. \n* 20% income option strategies. They are characterized by a high win rate (ideally 75% and above), high profit factors, uniform application across equities, and a focus on frontrunning institutional moves based on taking advantage of *their* long-term strategies for generating wealth. We would use the Kelly Criterion to determine allocation and guard against disproportionate losses. These replace bonds entirely. \n* 20% cash, preferably in a MMF or saving accounts with an interest rate that tracks inflation. \n\nThe big departure is replacing the fixed income portion of bonds and substituting it with options. It probably sounds ludicrous for those who view options as speculative, but that\'s due to retail primarily using options for speculation. They don\'t employ a systematic approach to generating profit and curtailing risk. Yet there are several ways to approximate the function of bonds to get sequential cash flow.^2 All of them are based on exploiting how money flows through the structure of the market, not whether an individual stock/ETF will directionally move in our favor. The tradeoff is accepting moderately higher risk for much better return, and the risk can be ameliorated.  \n\nThe arguments in favor of options over bonds are the following: \n\n* In theory, you stand to lose your entire premium if the option expires worthless. In reality, it is easy to set up contracts so that you retain time premium and exit them to preserve the majority of your capital. Unless you\'re running a 0DTE, you should never lose more than 25-30% before hitting the stop loss. \n* Since these strategies piggyback off the embedded behavior of institutions, they are agnostic to the state of the market. It doesn\'t matter if it is in a bullish, bearish, or sideways period. By contrast bonds rely on a disinflationary/deflationary environment to appreciate in value. In inflationary environments, bonds are doubly penalized: you lose on real yield returns and the underlying value is crushed as rates are hiked.\n* As these income option contracts are primarily short duration, the cash from premiums + returns can be invested into longer-dated puts during market corrections. At the bottom of bear markets, the cash flow can be diverted into equities.\n* Repeatable options strategies are not that rare. For example, there is a multi-leg setup that has a historical win rate of 90% with an average 20% return per winning transaction and a 17:1 profit factor. When we exclude compounding and focus on a fixed initial stake executed once per week, you will generate roughly 600% return on that investment over 40 weeks. The general loss when it fails is 5-10% with an occasional dip below 20%. There are strategies based on gamma exposure, anchored VWAP on stocks with strong upwards/downward momentum, 0DTE credit spreads, selling contracts on blue-chips during periods of momentary weakness, etc. that succeed 80-95% of the time once you filter for ideal candidates and set the appropriate contract parameters. The biggest obstacle to success is maintaining the discipline to avoid exposure to big losses. \n* As a corollary to 3 and 4, the outsized profit factor allows you to allocate more to equities and commodities while maintaining a low Sharpe ratio. The returns are cycled into cash on a weekly basis, which gives you the flexibility to rebalance portfolio distribution based on the state of the market. \n* The majority of principal dedicated to options is never in play at any particular point. It is technically cash until it\'s tied up into contracts - the wagered amount is sized according to the Kelly Criterion. In practice you\'ll have 35-40% of the portfolio in cash. While the inherent risk is higher for options than bonds, the overall risk to the portfolio is lower in the face of secular economic changes.\n\nThis is not a gameplan for passive investors. It requires a moderate amount of oversight. \n\n^1 The difference between external leverage and internal leverage is how the investment produces outsized returns. External leverage is increasing the base return on an investment by using debt and pledging collateral against said debt. This debt is independent of the investment\'s mechanics, such as a margin account. Internal leverage is selecting securities whose price movement amplifies changes in the underlying environment or asset, treating the security as a second order derivative. Think of junior miners that go up 500%, 1000%, 5000% during a gold bull market. The key to using internal leverage successfully is to get exposure to upside volatility while mitigating downside volatility, using a combination of allocation size and selecting capital-efficient proxies with good management. Leveraged ETFs are not considered.\n\n^2 Bonds are simply a debt contract between the issuer and the holder where the latter assumes reliable, predictable behavior from the former. In the case of the U.S. government, the holder assumes the government is both solvent and willing to fulfill their obligations. Guess what that also describes? An options contract. The difference is you, as a holder, are counting on consistent behavior from the major institutions who control 80-85% of all transaction volume. In the aggregate they exhibit formulaic actions when rebalancing their portfolios, protecting their downside, and so on that is easily exploitable. It\'s this feature, not a promise to pay interest, that generates long-term cash flow.', 'Lots of these comments read like late 2021.', 'As unhappy I am with the CROX acquisition of Hey Dude and how much of a drag it has been on the business, it is worth keeping in context that the business is otherwise cruising ahead.

This is insider trading and a violation of SEC rules. They attempt to hide their interactions by breaking up the total bid and spreading it over brokerages, as many as 15-16, across different IP addresses. The origin and size of the orders **do not** show up in the options chain - you need a scanning program that scraps and filters transactions across every platform from ThinkOrSwim to E-Trade.\n\nAlternately, market makers are forced to delta hedge when a stock's price approaches a large concentration of calls/puts at a particular strike. The gamma exposure leaves the options seller vulnerable to paying millions, oftentimes billions, if they don't cover their downside. Buying shares for hedging accelerates price movement to the strike itself.\n\n* Because these bids and the relevant information are hidden, it doesn't change the cost of the premiums. Think about how IV crush destroyed anyone who had bought NVDA contracts in the 3 days leading up to earnings. The market makers, those selling the contracts, fleeced retail with outrageous costs as long as demand stayed elevated. They knew that the options distribution constricted NVDA's possible upwards movement to 145, yet the call + put spread required NVDA to hit 154 to justify the risk. When huge bets are done secretly, you get a window where the risk/reward options structure is disproportionately in your favor. Market makers utilize mathematical models to determine the breakeven point when it's favorable to sell options at a profit. If the market at large knew who was betting and why, the premiums would adjust upwards to meet that point.\n* In the case of gamma exposure, you know the market maker cannot afford to do nothing when the price steadily climbs or drops towards that point. It could wipe out a significant portion of their allotted capital. If you've ever seen instances when a stock randomly jumps up/down in the absence of catalysts or sector sympathy, it is likely that a market maker forced it to that point. \n\n> If there are strategies that return 600% on your investment in a year, why wouldn't someone make them 100% of their portfolio?\n\nSome traders do.

11,AMD: The $145 Recovery Rally is Coming Next Week,"**The Why**

* **Earnings beat** revenue expectations with $6.82B (+18% YoY) and EPS of .92 (+31% YoY and spot on with projection) 
* Data center revenue surged **+122%**, proving AMD is gaining AI momentum.
* Recent selloff (-$30/share) was a **market overreaction** to slightly soft Q4 guidance.
* The market shifted focus to NVIDIA's upcoming earnings stalling an AMD rally.
* **Catalysts**: Workforce optimization, IBM partnership, and AI-focused leadership changes.

# The Setup

AMD is streamlining its org for an **AI-dominated future**:

1. **Reduction in Force**: Cutting 4% of workforce to focus on AI chip development.
2. **New Leadership**: CFO transition positions AMD for its next growth phase.
3. **IBM Partnership**: MI300X accelerators are now a key piece of IBM Cloud’s AI stack.

13,Manchester United stock (NYSE: MANU) – potential to grow,"According to Forbes magazine Manchester United is the second most valuable club in football, only behind Real Madrid. Only Real Madrid and Barcelona have more fans in the world. This is despite the fact that last major trophy they won is Premier League in 2013.  This was the last season with Sir Alex Ferguson at the helm – he is the best manager in history of this club. He retired and since then they are struggling a lot and underperforming. Last season they finished 8^(th) in the Premier League, this season they are 13^(th). Disappointment. They play in Europa League, second tier competition in Europe. The real money is in Champions League.

They have a tremendous potential. Big history, a lot of fans, a lot of money. They should compete for the most important throphies every year. But they didn’t in previous years and fans are angry about that.

Things are subject to change though. At the end of 2023 Sir James Ratcliffe bought 25% of club’s shares. He is the fan of the club and he has a lot to say about how the club is run. He is committed to rebuilding club and bring back glory the club aspire to. On January 2024 Omar Berrada was appointed as new CEO of the club, chief executive officer. He joined United after 13 years spent in Manchester City that was the most successful club in England during this period. On July 2024 Dan Ashworth started to work as sporting director. He worked for Newcastle and Brighton previously. He did a really god job there. In Brighton under his watch they transferred in Caicedo, Mac Allister, Cucurella, Mitoma and Trossard, they sold them later for more money. In Newcastle he was in charged when they bought Isak, Gordon, Barnes, Tonali and Botman. Great business. Recently they hired Ruben Amorim, who was successful in Sporting Lisboa. In the summer he was considered as new Liverpool FC manager, eventually they decided to go with Arne Slot who is excellent in his new role.

The future for Manchester United is bright. They have a competent people running the club. Ruben Amorim is one of the best of young managers in the world and seems to be a really good pick who is able to transform the whole club like Jurgen Klopp did it at Liverpool in the last decade. He needs time but he seems to be capable of making Manchester United great again. They were underperforming in the last 10 years but finally they addressed the issues and should be performing better. They need a time, of course, to build strong team. The thing is – if they perform on the pitch, they earn more money. I believe it is the matter of time before they are on the top. And when they reach this level, when they compete amongst really the best, their stock price should be much higher than it is now.

I think they will be a strong again very soon, they will compete and good performance on the pitch will result with big amount of cash going to the club. The next 10 years should be much better than the last 10 years. Currently their stock price is 17,47 USD. They certainly has potential for more. One more reason is – there are more and more money in football every year so this is another factor in favor of this stock.

I think that this club will compete for Premier League and Champions League in 2-4 years and it should have a huge impact on their finances. My opinion is this stock has potential to grow. Am I wrong? What do you think? I am new in the stock market so maybe I am missing something.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gxinau/manchester_united_stock_nyse_manu_potential_to/,"['The club has been one of the worst managed in Europe for over a decade.

I walk into sport shops now in Ireland and Man City jersies are on sale, and you dont see Utd jersies anymore, especially amongst the children.\n\n\nThere is also going to be a redevelopment of their ground and they'll have to deploy capital there instead of signings in the medium term."", ""Oh we're really just throwing crap at the wall and hoping it sticks now."", 'Not one single mention of anything financial related.', ""The club is still valued in the billions and have a rabid fan base even tho they have been terrible in recent years.

You have a stock that went public 12 years ago and is up 25%. Anyone who\'s a fan probably enjoys owning a piece of the team but it\'s not been a very good investment. If the team gets better the stock might be somewhat better going forward, but I still think you are going to be able to find better investments elsewhere than an improved MANU. I just don\'t think that there\'s much interest in public sports teams unless people think that there\'s some chance of buyout.', 'Only own it if your a  supporter.  Period.  And only 1 share.', 'Worthless ""analysis"". Football clubs are inherently a terrible investment due to the massive salaries that they pay players.

Now hardly any are united.\n\nBut the old guard are there, and a good season or two and they’ll be back. But predicting when that will be is the issue. Management, ownership, and signings have been terrible. Maybe keeping Ruud on for old time sake 😎', 'Not true. If they will perform better on the pitch, they will earn more money. If they will play in Champions League, they will earn more money, because in comparison to Europa League, Champions League pays much more money. And it is easier to cut sponsorship deals if you are a member of Champions League. Finance and performance on the pitch is intertwined.']"

Then as we would usually see analysts revise their predictions after the market moves (especially if they called it wrong), to make it seem they are smart or something, BOFA securities revised their predictions, to be even more wrong, showing that they are doubling down on their/people-who-listen-to-theirtrading-advice shorts and are willing to be in denial on a stock even if the market decides they are wrong.

Its not the end of the world to have entrenched shorts, since at the end of the day their losses are unlimited, and when they do close its more capital injected, the longer they waited.

15,Are we putting too much faith in generative AI? Could this hurt AI investments more broadly?,"Obviously a lot of money is being made off of AI-related stocks. I'm not one of those lucky investors. Part of the reason is that I fear we're not in a general AI bubble, as many have discussed, but rather a *generative AI* bubble. I'd appreciate hearing how others feel about this.

Right now, by far the bulk of investment is focused on generative AI (especially LLMs), with NVDA at or very near the center of it all, thanks to its GPUs. Meanwhile, alternative AI approaches (e.g., neuromorphic computing, symbolic AI, reinforcement learning, and hybrid models) have been getting far less attention.

The problem? As impressive as it may seem, generative AI has some significant (and inherent) drawbacks:

* Factually unreliable outputs (it can’t reliably distinguish fact from fiction)
* Probabilistic reasoning (no true causal understanding)
* High computational costs (questionable sustainability)
* Limited real-world problem-solving abilities

At some point, the reality of generative AI's limitations will become apparent enough to investors that we could see an AI market correction or even collapse. This would not only hurt AI stocks like NVDA, but it could also starve funding for alternative AI approaches that have long-term potential yet have been largely overlooked.

How is this influencing your investment decisions?",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gxezqq/are_we_putting_too_much_faith_in_generative_ai/,"[""You missed out the fact that generative AI is essentially a logarithmic function as well.

Much appreciated.\n\nYou are right that I failed to mention the diminishing returns with scaling generative AI models. This is a key issue. As models grow larger, the improvements in performance often become less pronounced compared to the exponential increase in computational costs. It's a known limitation of generative AI, and it partly explains why some experts are starting to question its long-term scalability.\n\nAs for alternative AI models, while they’re still in development, they're more than theoretical. Neuromorphic computing, for instance, is in use in some niche applications like robotics and low-power AI systems, and symbolic AI is making a comeback, especially in hybrid models that combine reasoning with machine learning. These approaches have their own set of challenges, but they’re being actively researched, and some promising work is being done outside the generative AI space.\n\nI agree with you that these alternative approaches aren’t as commercially developed as generative AI yet, but if funding continues to concentrate primarily on LLMs, we risk starving these other areas of innovation. It’s something to keep in mind as generative AI continues to dominate the investment landscape."", 'doesnt synthetic data reduce this pressure?', ""Another excellent response. It's funny --I wasn't sure whether I should post this here or in an AI subreddit, thinking that I might get a better response in the latter, but your comment and the others so far have been very insightful. Thank you for that.\n\nLike others above, you bring up some valid counterpoints, so I've tried to dig into them:\n\n* **On factually unreliable outputs (RAG and QA)**: I agree that Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and incorporating human-in-the-loop (HITL) mechanisms can help mitigate the issue of factually unreliable outputs, particularly for mission-critical applications. However, even with these safeguards, there are still fundamental challenges in ensuring that AI models can consistently distinguish fact from fiction across diverse domains. Human judgment will always play a crucial role in high-risk scenarios. It’s not just about tolerance for error; it’s about mitigating the consequences of those errors, especially in fields like healthcare, law, and finance, where the stakes are higher.\n* **On probabilistic reasoning (actuarial sciences)**: Point well taken! lol As you implied, in the actuarial sciences probabilistic models do make decisions based on data patterns without deep causal reasoning. But the difference here is that while actuarial science is successful in many domains, AI's current limitations in *causal* understanding still present problems in real-world applications, especially where critical decisions need to be made based on cause-and-effect logic. While we can get close to “good enough,” we’re still far from a true understanding of the world, which will remain an important gap to address for more complex tasks.\n* **On computational costs (declining costs)**: Yes, there’s been progress in reducing token costs for generative models, and that’s encouraging. But I think the issue is not just per-token costs but the *overall* computational cost of training and running increasingly large models. While costs may decrease in the short-term, the sheer scale of AI models like GPT-4 and beyond means that AI infrastructure and energy demands will continue to grow, and this is something that may not be sustainable at large scales. Even with improvements in efficiency, the resource cost to scale generative AI models is something that needs to be addressed long-term.\n* **On limited real-world problem-solving abilities (AI orchestration)**: You’re right that we can teach AI more relevant real-world knowledge through orchestration and deeper learning. However, even with better training, models still struggle with complex decision-making that requires understanding context, ambiguity, and reasoning beyond what they’ve been trained on. While progress is being made, true general problem-solving capability—like what we see in human cognition—remains a significant challenge.\n\nLastly, I agree that we are early in the development of AI, and there’s a lot of potential ahead. But while there’s money to be made in the short-term, my concern is that the focus on generative AI may crowd out exploration into alternative, potentially more sustainable or transformative AI approaches. If the market corrects, as I suspect it may, we could see that funding for new paradigms gets squeezed.\n\nThanks again for the discussion! It’s really interesting to hear your take. You and the others who commented have already influenced my perspective for the better."", '> takes AI 1 second to write a software program that would have taken me hours\n\n\nDisagree!\xa0 If one is just doing a standard library task like mapping this stuff to that stuff, or generate a bunch of HTML pages mapped to some fields in an API, then, yes, A.I. can generate a good enough code for you.

Apologies if this is an ignorant question; I am new to this.', '""What stops the spending?"" Exactly. One can never predict. Thanks for sharing your feedback.', 'You raise some valid counterarguments. Thank you for sharing. Here are my thoughts...\n\n* **On factual reliability (Point 1)**: It’s true that newer generations of models, including ChatGPT, are working to improve factual accuracy. But even with future advancements, achieving full reliability is challenging due to the inherent nature of probabilistic models. Fine-tuning and incorporating better data sources will help, but I don’t think we’ll ever get to a point where these models are consistently trustworthy, especially in high-stakes domains like law or medicine.\n* **On probabilistic reasoning with constraints (Point 2)**: The idea of narrowing the gap with probabilistic reasoning is interesting. However, AI still lacks true causal reasoning and comprehension. While we may be able to make outputs look more human-like, it won’t necessarily lead to true understanding. So, while ""good enough"" might work in many situations, there are domains where deeper reasoning will always be required.\n* **On AI improving energy industries (Point 3)**: It’s true that AI is being used to optimize energy production in various sectors, which is a good thing. However, the computational demands of training large-scale models like GPT-4 are still enormous, and it’s unclear how sustainable this is in the long run. Even with improvements in energy efficiency, the resource cost of scaling up models to meet future demands could be problematic.', ""and imagine thinking AI capabilities won't get better.

So as an example, if you short sold 5 shares of mstr at 200 a little while ago and had to buy it back today, you would lose (~425-200)*5=~1125. \n\n2. Buy put options on the stock. Basically, this gives you the option to sell the stock at a certain price on a certain date. These will swing wildly in value with stock price swings, but you are not forced to execute a losing position. Instead, you lose money on the option contract itself.\n\nNow that thats out of the way, if you were to short a stock and bet correctly, you can make a lot. If you short sold djt or bought puts on it on election day/night at somewhere between 35-45 per share, and iirc it dropped to ~20 within like 4 days, your options wouldve killed it, and your short wouldve been way up (depending how many shares you bought).\n\nHowever, stock prices are not always rational. Something could be overvalued and still keep going up (hello palantir). While the correction could happen and your bet could pay off huge, its just as possible that the stock just keeps rising until your option contract expires or you have to buy back the shares. (“Right” answer but still wrong/wrong timing)\n\nI hope this was helpful - i’m going to reiterate once more, please do not start trading options or short selling if you are still an entry level trader unless you have thoroughly researched what you are doing, the stock, and are comfortable risking the amount you put down.

17,"FAA Green Light, $6B Orders, Stellantis Millions: Archer Aviation's $5M Flying Taxis may be the Tesla of the Sky","ACHR isn't just another eVTOL play. They are literally building the future of transportation while everyone else is still drawing pictures.

Their manufacturing facility will be completed in weeks. They have received a [$400M backing from Stellantis](https://beyondspx.com/article/archer-aviation-pioneering-the-future-of-electric-aviation) for production. This is not some vaporware - they have real manufacturing power. The company will pump out 650 aircraft yearly. That translates to billions in revenue when each Midnight sells for $5M+.

Regarding FAA certification, they have [already nailed Phase 3 of 4](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/archer-announces-third-quarter-2024-210500611.html). While other companies are still figuring out how to get off the ground, ACHR has already obtained their Part 135 certificate. They are ready to operate the moment they receive final approval.

Their international expansion is moving at an incredible pace. A [massive UAE deal is coming in Q4 2025](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/archer-hires-uae-leader-abu-050000552.html). They have just secured the UAE's top aviation regulator. Additionally, they have a [Japan Airlines partnership locked in](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/japan-airlines-sumitomo-corporation-joint-venture-130000670.html), which includes a $500M aircraft order. Their order book has now reached $6B+ with actual orders and deposits.

The most compelling aspect is that they have $500M cash on hand. They are burning far less capital than their competitors. With a big auto partnership, upcoming FAA approval, global expansion, and a first-mover advantage in a trillion-dollar market, this is not some penny stock moonshot. They are positioned as the next Tesla of the skies. The infrastructure is ready, regulations are green-lit, and wealthy individuals are eager for flying taxis. The numbers speak for themselves.

I think their primary market will be selling aircraft to those interested. Another limiting factor is that these craft will require a completely different piloting certification. It’s a new type of propulsion, and it’s vtol, transitioning to flying like a plane. The current pilots licenses don’t cover that kind of thing, which means either a new type of license, or a certification that you would need to attain after your fixed wing license.\n\nAnother major factor is how these would manage in bad weather, and poor visibility.

19,Zeta global short attack,"Hi, I've been following ZETA global for quite while now. It has recently suffered a 50% blow to its SP due to not good enough earnings followed by a report from short seller ""Culper research"".
 I won't go into details of thier report, but after reading it I believe it is of very low quality (they even got the ZETAs auditor wrong lol).

After the decline of the price I was tempted to start building a position, especially since the SP was starting to recover. However, today in PM the shares are going back to around 20$. Another short seller (Lauren Balik) has published a report. To me it once again seems like a blatant attempt of trying to lower the price. It is overblown and full of speculation. She also published similiar articles on NVDA, APP, SNOW. But the market is dumping anyway.

My question is - how likely is it going to actually hurt the company long term? Is it too risky to enter now? Do you know of some other companies targeted by mulriple short sellers In the past (I would like to examine how they did or did not recover)?

",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gx8xtj/zeta_global_short_attack/,"['""Do you know of some other companies targeted by mulriple short sellers In the past""\n\nThere\'s been plenty of companies targeted by shorts in the past that went to 0. Most of the Lampert era of Sears was a long vs short saga that lasted over a decade - it eventually was largely Lampert and former ""Morningstar Manager of the Decade"" Berkowitz on one side and the shorts on the other. There were tremendous short squeezes at times in Sears all the way down, but the closer it go to 0 the shorter they lasted. There were people posting at $2 that ""Eddie Lampert is a billionaire, he has a plan!"" Yes, he did - a plan for himself loaning the company money against the company\'s best real estate - heads I win, tails I win. It went from Business Week covers talking about how Lampert was going to create his Berkshire Hathway to eventual bankruptcy.\n\nI think that we\'re in an odd period where things have turned into memes or recovered in a fashion that would otherwise be unusual in the past. AMC has been able to dilute shareholders incessantly. If this was several years ago, it probably would have been a 0 already rather than the meme boost and the constant equity raises after that have been tolerated. Yellow went bankrupt then went up 600% before cratering. There are people who still think that Bed Bath and Beyond\'s bankruptcy is a massive conspiracy. SAVEQ seems to be the latest in the line of these - Gamestop\'s short squeeze seems to have taught a generation of investors that ""bad is not bad"", every poorly run company/mediocre business is a potential meme/short squeeze and anyone who has a different opinion is somehow conspiring against them. \n\nIn investing sometimes people are going to have differing opinions than you about your investments. Sometimes those people are going to have bigger platforms to broadcast their views. Sometimes those people are going to be right.

If you read what they have to say and still think you\'re right, you thank them for the opportunity and buy lower.\n\nInvesting is a life long learning experience and imo, people should be open to maybe learning from people who don\'t share the same opinion. \n\nIt\'s really only the last 5 years that any time there\'s a short discussion people run and post about ""MANIPULATION!!!"" Meanwhile, what would those people say if they were short the stock and the report was someone who was long? People have less ire towards pump and dump scams (hot quantum computing stock QUBT was ""Innovative Beverage Company"" not that long ago - keep in mind Long Island Iced Tea renaming itself Long Blockchain wasn\'t that many years ago) than they do towards someone who has a negative opinion on a popular retail long.  It\'s the Simpsons meme: ""Could I be wrong?"" ""No, it must be a short seller conspiracy.""\n\nNot everyone is going to share your opinion on your investments and be open to the idea that maybe they can make an interesting point you hadn\'t considered or be right. People rant about how any sort of short anything is ""manipulation"" but we\'re in a time period where people seem far less tolerant in investing to any opinion that isn\'t theirs. There was a time where Reddit wasn\'t full of little echo chamber stock-specific subreddits where people go to hear everyone agree with them and people could have differing opinions on here and it actually sometimes lead to good discussions rather than just insta-downvotes and/or being scolded for not agreeing with a prevailing trend/opinion on something.\n\n If you read what they have to say and still disagree, thank them for the opportunity and buy more - that\'s it.

Too many people think that short sellers can somehow destroy a company.  Shorted businesses that go to 0 are not good businesses. There's no fantastic business that was 0'd by shorts. If a stock is depressed after short reports and doesn't eventually rebound, perhaps the fundamentals were less than people thought.

20,C3AI begins to turn the tide,"C3.ai shares jumped 25% in a single day on the announcement of a deeper partnership with Microsoft. The new agreement clarifies Microsoft Azure as C3.ai's preferred cloud services platform and C3.ai's AI applications as Azure's preferred enterprise solutions. Although the two have been working together since 2018, this announcement pushes the market's focus on its AI potential higher.

Underestimated potential: c3.ai's revenue grew 21% in the quarter and is expected to grow 24% going forward. Current market capitalization is \~$4 billion and trades at a multiple of 11x its FY2025 revenue target.

Pilots: The company has 224 pilots, 85% of which are active, representing a 117% year-over-year increase in the number of pilots. 70% of pilots are expected to be converted into formal contracts.

Future Potential: Revenues are expected to pick up to 30% from current growth rates through pilots to formal deals. 2026 FY projected revenue target is $462 million, with a share price potential of up to $36 if it reaches an 8x EV/revenue valuation.

While the partnership has boosted market enthusiasm, I would wait for market sentiment to pull back before getting in. In addition, the conversion of pilots to full-fledged programs is key to future growth.

21,Thoughts on building a 10Y high risk portfolio,"Over the past few years I’ve built a portfolio consisting of S&P, Apple, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, JPM and BRK. It has done rather well, consistently giving returns of 25%+ annually (except 2022). 

However in recent times my conviction on adding more capital to this portfolio has waned. I just feel the best days in terms of returns for some of the big tech groups may not be what they were for the past decade.

I could 100% be wrong and there is no doubt there is certain bias seeing the return of my smaller positions this year dwarfing the ones of the traditional blue chip guys if you will.

So saying all this I’m considering: 

50% S&P

10% Hood

10% Rddt

10% Rolls Royce

10% Cava

5% Lunr

5% ASTS

Quick rationale for each:

Hood: Expanding to Europe and offering very exciting new products like Hood Gold 

Rddt: Fastest growing social media, ARPU and monetisation only getting better and seeing many more people using

Rolls Royce: Slight European exposure, building low cost Nuclear plants and capturing the wide body aircraft market

Cava: Fantastic management, strong customer retention and expected to double stores in next 5 years

Lunr & ASTS: Moonshot (literally), this is just in case space works out and much more speculative 



So having said all that, what is everyone’s thoughts on this proposed portfolio allocation. Is this too risky, not enough diversification into the different sectors?

22,Thoughts and dilemma on Rocket Lab? ,"I went into Rocket Lab back in July with the intention of making it my primary long-term growth stock and since then have managed to acquire 440 shares at average price of around $9.  

My intention was/is to keep buying and hold the stock for many many years, because I truly believe in the company potential and the overall space industry and I believe that it will be a key growth sector for the next decade and beyond regardless of who is in power in the US. (I am not american btw)

Just before the election I was in profit in the low thousands, which was nice but since the election I am now sitting at a profit of 147%, which is my best position in my investing ""career"" so far. 

Like I said, I believe the company will do well regardless of who is in power. However, given the fast rise since the election I am expecting correction happening soon. 

And my dilemma is: should exit now and take the profits and then go back in after the correction? Or should I just hold until the potential correction and start buying more then?

23,What I learnt from MSTR frenzy,"I have been a long term investor in MSTR, in fact buying  my position Pre-split.  
My thesis was very much connected to an alternative investment vehicle into Bitcoin.  Even though I have BTC as a holding in my crypto, I was more after exposure in an equity portfolio.

To cut a long story short, I bought it when it was no mainstream and no ETF's were existing.

I must admit, I sat on a loss for about one year in MSTR.  Buying at $48.10 (split adjusted), and for the longest time sitting at the $25-$30 range, BTC was consolidating and I was fine with that.

If people understand what MSTR are doing, this playbook with bonds and hedging BTC was already in play for a long time, I was lucky enough to understand this quite early and and bought it quite early.  The difference being now that BTC is on a breakout and other companies are now looking into this method as well, the eyes on MSTR has multiplied exponentially .

Fast forward one year, and and the FOMO crowd arrived, and with that volatility.

Here is what I learnt when the FOMO arrived:

1. The stock is no longer trading on anything but emotion and speculation.
2. Valuations do not matter anymore.  The premium on BTC was as low as 1.5 less than one year go, reaching a peak earlier this week at 3.5
3. The stock goes up like crazy, and comes down like crazy, and when this happens, it's time to exit as there is nothing that is in your control.
4. There is so much manipulation (e.g. the citron report, Social media, Mainstream coverage), on what... a damn tweet!  it is not really easy to understand how this will move, so at this point it is just gambling.

I held my position up to the $543 level, and eventually my stop losses triggered yesterday around the $500 level.  So after 1.5 years, I am out of the MSTR trade.

The lesson I learnt is when the crowds arrive, turn round and walk away.

I still believe in the MSTR playbook, but will only come back when I am at the front of the queue buying at a negotiated price not when I am in a bidding war with gamblers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gx4xb6/what_i_learnt_from_mstr_frenzy/,"['So from $48 to $500.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

28,Intuit shares drop as quarterly forecast misses estimates due to delayed revenue,"Intuit shares fell 6% in extended trading Thursday after the finance software maker issued a revenue forecast for the current quarter that trailed analysts’ estimates due to some sales being delayed.

Here’s how the company performed in comparison with LSEG consensus:

Earnings per share: $2.50 adjusted vs. $2.35 expected

Revenue: $3.28 billion vs. $3.14 billion

Revenue increased 10% year over year in the quarter, which ended Oct. 31, according to a statement. Net income fell to $197 million, or 70 cents per share, from $241 million, or 85 cents per share, a year ago.

While results for the fiscal first quarter topped estimates, second-quarter guidance was light. Intuit said it anticipates a single-digit decline in revenue from the consumer segment because of promotional changes for the TurboTax desktop software in retail environments. While that will affect revenue timing, it won’t have any impact on the full 2025 fiscal year.

Intuit called for second-quarter earnings of $2.55 to $2.61 per share, with $3.81 billion to $3.85 billion in revenue. The consensus from LSEG was $3.20 per share and $3.87 billion in revenue.

For the full year, Intuit expects $19.16 to $19.36 in adjusted earnings per share on $18.16 billion to $18.35 billion in revenue. That implies revenue growth of between 12% and 13%. Analysts polled by LSEG were looking for $19.33 in adjusted earnings per share and $18.26 billion in revenue.

Revenue from Intuit’s global business solutions group came in at $2.5 billion in the first quarter. The figure was up 9% and in line with estimates, according to StreetAccount. Formerly known as the small business and self-employed segment, the group includes Mailchimp, QuickBooks, small business financing and merchant payment processing.

“We are seeing good progress serving mid-market customers in MailChimp, but are seeing higher churn from smaller customers,” Sandeep Aujla, Intuit’s finance chief, said on a conference call with analysts. “We are addressing this by making product enhancements and driving feature discoverability and adoption to improve first-time use and customer retention.”

Better outcomes are a few quarters away, Aujla said.

CreditKarma revenue came in at $524 million, above StreetAccount’s $430 million consensus.

At Thursday’s close, Intuit shares were up about 9% so far in 2024, while the S&P 500 has gained almost 25% in the same period.

On Tuesday Intuit shares slipped 5% after The Washington Post said President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed “Department of Government Efficiency” had discussed developing a mobile app for federal income tax filing. But a mobile app for submitting returns from Intuit is “already available to all Americans,” CEO Sasan Goodarzi told CNBC’s Jon Fortt.

Goodarzi said on CNBC that he’s personally communicating with leaders of the incoming presidential administration.

On the earnings call, Goodarzi sounded optimistic about the economy.

“Our belief, which is not baked into our guidance, is that we will see an improved environment as we look ahead in 2025, particularly just with some of the things that I mentioned earlier around just interest rates, jobs, the regulatory environment,” he said. “These things have a real burden on businesses. And we believe that a better future is to come.”

29,How is Viking Therapeutics Inc not a no brainer buy right now?,"After some research, I really beleive this stock is gold:

Viking Therapeutics shared updates on its obesity treatment program for VK2735 at ObesityWeek:

Subjects achieved mean weight loss of up to 8.2% from baseline and 6.8% placebo-adjusted weight loss after 28 days of daily dosing at 100 mg. As far as I am concerned, I believe this is more effective than Mounjaro which demonstrated an average weight loss of approximately 4% of starting body weight after 4 weeks of treatment. 

Also, Oral VK2735 demonstrated a favorable safety profile, with 99% of adverse events classified as mild or moderate. The oral option could revolutionize weight loss treatments by offering greater convenience. 

Let’s look at subcutaneous VK2735 Result(or like doses): Weekly subcutaneous injections led to weight reductions of up to 14.7% from baseline. Up to 88% of treated patients achieved ≥10% weight loss, compared to 4% for placebo. Weight loss was progressive throughout the study, with no plateau at 13 weeks.

The obesity drug market is projected to grow to $130 billion by 2030, offering significant upside for VK2735. This is also important because at this size of a market, it can hold many or multiple big players. Analysts also predict Viking could become a takeover target due to its strong pipeline. This would boost the price up to 3 digits.

What’s more! The company also received praise for its liver disease treatment VK2809, which showed positive results in a Phase 2b trial for MASH (metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis), a serious liver condition affecting 22 million Americans. Reductions in liver fat ranging from 37% to 55% at 52 weeks, with response rates (≥30% reduction) as high as 88%, far exceed typical benchmarks. 

The clinical data reinforce VK2735's potential as a best-in-class obesity treatment with effective weight loss, strong safety, and durability of results. The only reason why the stock hasn’t sky-rocketed is because of fear mongering by market makers in the aftermath of RFK junior, and as far as I’m concerned, diabete and liver diseases will not go away and the desperation I’ve seen for patients to obtain these drug is mad. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gwvb46/how_is_viking_therapeutics_inc_not_a_no_brainer/,"[""Nothing you mentioned suggests that the company is making any money or will make any money.\n\nEdit: They are, in fact, losing money.\n\nAnd don't ignore the fact that insurance companies are dropping coverage for weight loss drugs."", 'the time to buy was 2 years ago when it was trading around $10-$20 \n\nnow? i think you missed the boat \n\nand tbh, i think it already peaked last year', 'Meh.

Many promising drugs fail to translate into meaningful revenue due to regulatory delays, manufacturing, etc. GMP and GDP is hard, and EU regs especially are rough. \n\nthe market for weight-loss drugs is becoming crowded, with established powerhouses like Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. wegovy is a meme. Viking will need significant resources to carve out market share.\n\nlastly, the issue of insurance coverage is critical. If insurers are scaling back coverage for weight-loss drugs, even effective treatments may struggle to gain traction, as out-of-pocket costs might soar. major factor limiting the broader adoption of similar therapies!\ncould the stock moon tho? of course, this shit is all random anyway.', ""Hi thanks for the more detailed responses, but my position is still largely unchanged and several responses:\n\n1: Your first concern only manifests if I choose to hold until commercialization, but I can name in numerous pharma firms who made very promisable profits before even full on commercialization. ie before the full commercialization of its COVID-19 vaccine, Moderna's market valuation surged due to strong Phase 3 trial results, government contracts, and partnerships. Also, BioNTech rose to prominence during its COVID-19 vaccine development with Pfizer, achieving substantial valuation gains after early-stage clinical success. This will likely be the case if you cannot disprove the facts I provided.\n\n2: The market for Viking is dominating looking as of now. I've responded to someelse to, but here let me restate the comparative advantage of Viking. First is tolerability, for Mounjaro, common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and other gastrointestinal issues, typical of GLP-1 agonists. But with VK2735, participants reported mild to moderate side effects and significantly less severe symptoms. I'd also note that most patients fail to take consistent doses of Mounjaro due to side effects, now compare the frequency to Viking. For Mounjaro, participants achieved an average weight loss of 15-22.5% of body weight over 72 weeks, depending on the dose (5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg). This means a huge frequency of doses a long time frame. Compare this to Viking which is NOTABLY only in its Phase 2 mid-stage trial, participants experienced a 15% weight loss over just 13 weeks. Far less injections and far more effective in the time frame that you can compare them. These all prove that Viking has a clear comparative edge as of now, unless you can disprove these facts.\n\n3: I think insurance coverage is a completely valid concern you raise actually especially for the short term. But in the long run, I believe it will be highly valued because obesity is more than a standalone condition; it is a complex metabolic disease that can contribute to or exacerbate various health conditions. Effective treatment of obesity can have significant benefits across multiple medical indications, so this is why people will be desperate for getting treatment. \n\nIf you still maintain your position, I really hope to hear back from you bc at the end of the day, I'm just an average investor looking for more insights.""]"

31,"Gap shares surge as it raises guidance, touts ‘strong start’ to holiday","Hurricanes and unseasonably warm weather hit sales at Gap during its fiscal third quarter, but the apparel company still posted better-than-expected results, leading it to raise its annual guidance for a third time this year. 

Gap, which runs Old Navy, Banana Republic, Athleta and its namesake banner, is now expecting fiscal 2024 sales to be up between 1.5% and 2%, compared with previous guidance of “up slightly.” That’s ahead of the 0.4% growth that LSEG analysts had expected, and bodes well for the all-important holiday shopping season, which is now underway. 

The company is also anticipating gross margins and operating income will grow more than it previously expected.

Shares surged about 13% in extended trading.

Here’s how the nation’s largest specialty apparel retailer performed compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 72 cents vs. 58 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $3.83 billion vs. $3.81 billion expected

Gap’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended Nov. 2 was $274 million, or 72 cents per share, compared with $218 million, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier. 

Sales rose to $3.83 billion, up about 2% from $3.78 billion a year earlier.

Across Gap’s business, unseasonably warm weather affected sales by about 1 percentage point during the quarter, while storms and hurricanes led overall store sales to fall by 2%, CEO Richard Dickson told CNBC in an interview. 

“We had unusual circumstances, hurricanes, storms that led to almost 180 closures at the peak of the impact,” said Dickson, adding the storms affected Old Navy, Gap’s largest brand by revenue, the most. 

As soon as the weather turned around, sales “rebounded” and the holiday shopping season is off to a “strong start” so far, said Dickson. 

“We are energized about the holiday. Our teams are really focused on executing our plans. If we compare ourselves to where we were last year, our brands are in a much more pronounced place than they were last year,” he said. “We’ve got stronger brand identities and we’re more practiced in our playbook that we talk a lot about, driving better product, better pricing, more relevance, better consumer experience and excellence in execution.” 

Since Dickson took the helm of Gap a little over a year ago, he’s worked to turn around the business after years of declines. Under his direction, the company has leaned into nostalgic marketing and celebrity partnerships to reclaim cultural relevance. Sales have grown for the last four quarters in a row, but the company is still smaller than it once was, and critics say it needs to do more to fix its product assortment and drive full-price selling.

Here’s a closer look at each brand’s performance: 

**Old Navy:** Gap said sales at its largest brand grew 1% to $2.2 billion, while comparable sales were flat, shy of the 0.9% growth that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. Old Navy’s kids category was particularly affected by the warmer weather, said Dickson. 

**Gap:** Gap’s eponymous banner grew 1% to $899 million during the quarter, while comparable sales were up 3% — better than the 2.3% growth Wall Street expected, according to StreetAccount. The brand has seen four straight quarters of positive comparable sales and is benefiting from better marketing and product, the company said. 

**Banana Republic:** The trendy workwear line grew sales 2% to $469 million while comparable sales fell 1%, a bit worse than the 0.8% drop that StreetAccount had expected. The brand has worked to turn around its men’s business, which drove results during the quarter. Overall, it is still focused “on fixing the fundamentals,” the company said. 

**Athleta:** The athleisure arm of Gap’s empire grew sales by 4% to $290 million while comparable sales were up 5%. The results weren’t comparable to estimates. In the year-ago period, comparable sales were down 19% at Athleta. Under its new CEO, former Alo Yoga boss Chris Blakeslee, the brand has managed to turn things around.

33,Deep dive into Etsy - On a path to a dangerous spiral,"**1.0 Introduction**

Etsy started by brilliantly carving out a niche in handmade and vintage goods, but now it faces challenges that threaten its unique spot in e-commerce and I’ll argue it is going down the path to a dangerous spiral.

The idea to connect buyers with sellers of handmade/vintage goods is amazing, and there’s no doubt that there is demand for it.

Any marketplace has two important metrics:

* The **Gross Merchandise Value**, also known as “GMV”, represents the value of all products sold through the website. Etsy decided to use **Gross Merchandise Sales** (“GMS“), which is just a different term.
* The **take-rate** represents their share of the GMS.

Its GMS increased from \~$4 billion in 2018 (prior to the pandemic) to $13.5 billion in 2021. However, since then, Etsy has experienced a decline and the GMS in 2023 was $13.2 billion. The lack of growth is either a lack of demand or a lack of supply in the marketplace.

**2.0 The real problem**

The company discloses the number of active buyers and sellers, and together, they paint quite a picture.

The number of active sellers continued to grow. From 2021 to 2023, it increased from 7.5 million to 9 million.

The number of buyers has been flat.

Economics101 teaches us a simple lesson: ***If the demand is stable, and there is an increase in supply, the prices will decrease.***

Economics also teaches that ***lower prices would attract more buyers, increasing the demand.***

***So, where are the buyers?***

As Etsy doesn’t (and cannot) check the quality of all the products, more and more AI-generated product images combined with dropshipping flood the market. Here's a comment from a Reddit user that in my opinion does a great job summarizing the development:

""*Drop-shipping has absolutely ruined online marketplaces. I used to adore Etsy when it first started, but now its just absolute garbage. You have to reverse image search everything nowadays to make sure it's the real deal and actually handmade. This recently happened to me when I was trying to buy some pretty dice for my dnd group. Turned out it was a scam using a real artisan's pictures to sell their cheap shit. Thankfully, I was able to rectify the issue, but it was a hustle.*""

The U.S. sellers used to contribute over 75% of Etsy’s revenue a decade ago. Now, it’s down to \~50%.

I’ll argue that this might lead to a spiral that will harm Etsy in the long run, with the events being:

1. Increase in low-value products on Etsy.
2. The low-value products will be perceived as a better deal when compared to the high-value products as they are cheaper.
3. The sellers of high-value products will sell fewer products, and some of them will eventually leave Etsy.
4. The buyers will be disappointed by the low-value products and will not use Etsy as much (or at all).

**3.0 What is Etsy doing?**

Etsy is spending \~30% of its revenue on Marketing (vs. 20% a decade ago) and has even engaged in TV ads to raise awareness and bring new customers.

Over the last few years, the company has been spending $700-800m per year, only to keep the revenue flat. It is accepting the fact that buyers will be disappointed, and the strategy is to replace them with new ones.

**4.0 The take-rate**

The only other way for Etsy to grow its revenue is to increase its take-rate, and its share of the GMS.

The company splits its revenue into two groups:

* **Marketplace revenue** (\~73% of total) - These are **required** fees that cannot be avoided (Transaction fees, payment processing fees, listing fees).
* **Service revenue** (\~27% of total) - These are **optional**, such as on-site advertising, shipping labels, etc.

Its take-rate is incredibly high at \~21%, double from a decade ago. For comparison, eBay’s take rate is \~14%.

**5.0 Terrible management decisions**

As the company was reaching its peak, the management decided to make 3 large acquisitions:

* **Reverb** (Aug 15th, 2019) - A marketplace for new, used, and vintage music gear was acquired for **$270 million**.
* **Elo 7** (July 2nd, 2021) - Also known as the “Etsy of Brazil”, a Brazil-based marketplace for unique, handmade items was acquired for **$212 million**.
* **Depop** (July 12th, 2021) - a global fashion resale marketplace was acquired for \~**$1.5 billion**.

It is important to note that Depop had an annual revenue of **$70 million!** No, this is not a typo. Etsy paid over 20x its revenue to acquire Depop!

Well, not that long later, in Q3-2022, the company recorded impairment charges of **over $1 billion** for Depop and Elo7. No better way to destroy shareholders’ value quickly, than by overpaying for an acquisition.

A year later, in Q3-2023, Elo7 was sold at a loss.

**6.0 Historical financial performance**

Historically, this is still an impressive growth. Its revenue grew from <$200 million a decade ago, to $2.8 billion in the last twelve months and its gross margin remains stable at \~70%.

Its operating margin is lingering around 12% now, as both marketing & product development as % of revenue have been increasing. The increase in marketing expense (as % of revenue) has already been highlighted in a previous section. It is necessary to maintain the buyers’ base. So potential future improvements in the operating margin can only arise by decreasing the product development and general & administrative (as % of revenue).

**7.0 Valuation**

The two key variables when it comes to valuing a company are:

* **Revenue** \- Given that the number of active buyers hasn’t grown in the last few years, it is difficult to expect revenue growth above inflation.
* **Operating margin** \- I do think there’s room to improve the margins by reducing product development and general & administrative (as % of revenue). My assumption is that that it will increase to 14% over time.

Based on my input, the fair value of the company is **$3.2 billion ($29/share)**. This is significantly lower than the current market cap of **$5.7 billion ($51/share)**.

Anyone betting on Etsy is ultimately betting that:

1. The number of low-value products will decrease over time.
2. The number of buyers will start growing again
3. Etsy can continue increasing its take-rate, without losing sellers of high-value products.
4. The management will not engage in acquisition (as they are clearly bad at it).

34,The Bullish case for OPRA,"With Google under pressure from the DOJ, this looks like a huge potential for Opera. If Google was forced to sell Chrome, this would give smaller browsers, like Opera, a great chance to gain some market share. Also, when you look at browsers, excluding Edge and Firefox, Opera has a pretty substantial user base by comparison. They are also one of the only ""browser stocks"" that there are. At least the only one of any substance. 



On the flip side, even if Google ISN'T forced to sell Chrome, then we should see the momentum continue for GOOG.

I’ve been a long term holder of OPRA for this very reason. They have a steady growing base of 350M users and are continuing to buy up smaller browser companies. I’ve always looked at OPRA as a hedge against GOOG, at least as far as their browser is concerned. It also pays to hold because they have a great divided.

I’ve been a long term holder of GOOG too though. I think both are great companies, but I’m buying both to more or less hedge my bets.

I think OPRA has a strong chance of seeing some gains if DOJ does follow through.

38,Any investors here looking at European markets ?,"Let me preface this by saying I live in Europe and after dabbling initially in companies closer to home switched to US markets due to higher historical returns.

This in hindsight was an excellent decision as almost all my investments in the S&P/Nasdaq have outperformed the ones listed in Europe. So do any American guys look at European markets and see any opportunity to create alpha or are bullish on the EU markets. 

There’s an argument to be made that potentially investing into EU serves as a way to diversify and lower exposure to US markets. But I find it very hard to find good European companies with solid fundamentals that have good stock performance. Could be a myriad of reasons including liquidity, slower growth, more regulation and government oversight. 

Personally the three companies I still have in my portfolio in the EU markets is RR, NVO and LVMH. LVMH is slowing down but most likely due to luxury market turmoil and exposure to China. Additionally NVO is listed on NYSE and had uptil recently performed rather well.

So finally my question being are any guys actively eschewing the American markets for European ones or actively increasing their allocation, if so would love to know the rationale. And more importantly any particular industries or geographies that you’re targeting? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gwgyqv/any_investors_here_looking_at_european_markets/,"[""I'm German and the only German stocks I'd consider would be rheinmetall (+108% 1y) and sap (+61%)."", 'No, 100% U.S.\n\nRationale being I like money.', 'A lot of pharmaceutical companies are doing badly right now including NVO and AZN.

*For the quarter ended October 31, Palo Alto Networks reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.56 versus the consensus estimate of $1.47. Revenue totaled $2.14B versus the estimate of $2.12B.*

*For the quarter in progress, Palo Alto Networks expects adjusted earnings per share to range from $1.54 to $1.56, with a mid-point that matches the estimate. Its revenue projection for the second quarter ranges from $2.22B to $2.25B, which represents 13% growth year over year. The mid-point of $2.235B comes in just above the estimate of $2.23B.*   

*Second quarter Next-Generation Security ARR is expected to range from $4.7B to $4.75B, which would represent a year-over-year increase of 20%.*

*Total revenue for fiscal year 2025, which runs from August 2024 through July 2025, is expected to range from $9.12B to $9.17B. This would represent 14% growth year over year.* 

*""Our platformization progress continued in Q1, driving strong financial results,"" said Dipak Golechha, chief financial officer of Palo Alto Networks. ""As a result, we are raising our NGS ARR, revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance for the year.""*

*The board of directors also approved a two-for-one stock split, which will increase the number of authorized common shares from 1B to 2B. Trading on a split-adjusted basis is expected to begin on Dec. 16, 2024.*

I've been a big fan of PANW for the last 2 years. While the billings decline isn't great, it's been expected as the company pushes for platformization. I anticipate this to be great in the long term outlook, but short term, may seem like growth is slowing. Platformization will make their services sticky and harder for companies to leave because they'll be integrated across the business across multiple levels.

Although I'm a big fan of the stock, I will admit it's an expensive one.

40,What am I misunderstanding about SPYI?,"What am I misunderstanding about SPYI?

It is often recommended that investors just stick to ETFs such as SPY because it is very unlikely a person will out perform it with their own picks. If I am correct SPY has a like a 7%-8% return all time and closer to like 10% or higher in the last couple years. 
Anyway I see S&Ps high income ETF is just under 12% TTM. So does that mean if I have $100,000 I would get $11,950 in dividends a year? Wouldn’t this be higher than the growth and TTM combined SPY has? If so why wouldn’t everyone just invest in this and get 12% dividends a year?

It's true that the growth isn't the same as SPY but there hasn't been any net value decrease so far aside from the first few months.  I got in at 49.60 in May and its at 52.19.  And while SPY has gone from 529 to 590 in the same frame - I didn't have enough capital to make it beneficial.\n\nI've seen 3200 in dividends and 2600 in growth on 50k in those 6 months for roughly 5800.  In that same amount of time in SPY would have yielded 8400.\n\nThis just happens to be my strategy for my 401k, where I balance growth ETFs with dividend ETFs."", 'That’s for the response, follow up questions\n\n1. If it is in my Roth, that wouldn’t matter right?\n\n2. I don’t understand that, wouldn’t it increase my net assets by 12%?  $100,000 (Original Investment) + $11,950 (TTM) = $111,950?', 'How can a covered call force you to sell of the price goes down?

It literally pays for our medical without having to draw down the principal. Oh our boo is up 40% from last year or so', 'No the divi does not go up when the price goes down in covered call ETFs.', 'You also watched it during a huge spy bull run, so all you’ve seen is the CCs capping gains but no NAV loss.  As you pointed out, it still underperformed buy and hold spy. \n\nOn a down year it’s going to be catastrophic.', 'When a dividend is paid, the stock price decreases by the amount paid out. The money doesn’t just come out of thin air.', 'Why is the divi in JEPI higher in down months then? Wouldn’t the increased volatility lead to higher premiums on options and thus higher dividend payments?', 'CC funds outperform the underlying in a down year for the underlying', ""It isn't 1:1. The asset may just not increase in value.\xa0 Where company Z may have x amount of growth or cash on hand and the value of the company goes up, the company with a dividend pays it out to shareholders and the price goes sideways.\xa0 I would say the dip usually comes from people selling after Dividend date"", ""I'm not trying to start an argument but this is a bit of a truism. The price/value connection is remarkably elastic and a fair amount of the time companies are really good at destroying the value of retained earnings they could have paid out as a dividend."", 'The dividend is up in down months because JEPI is doing ROC, and is essentially charging you a fee to give your money back to you. \n\nThese CC income funds look good but they are a huge dividend trap and should be avoided.', 'Only if the premium outpaces the NAV erosion.', 'From an accounting principles perspective it is 1:1. Market conditions can change the stock price but at a pure principles level the cash paid out comes directly from the companies assets.', 'Or large institutions, they keep track of SHYT like that', 'There is no NAV erosion if the market is declining and your calls never end up being exercised', 'Sure, but is every dividend stocks price based exclusively on how much cash on hand it has? No.', 'If the premium generated from the calls is less than the yield of the fund, then they have to sell the underlying at a loss to make the yield…. And the NAV itself erodes in a down market simply because the underlying asset is down. \n\nYou shouldn’t talk about things you don’t understand.', 'You should consider your own advice. CC funds don’t have a fixed yield, so if premium is light then so is yield. They don’t eat into assets to pump yield', 'Depends on the fund. Many attempt to always hit the same yield (like QYLD), and will use ROC to achieve this if they have to.  You need to read the prospectus. \n\nI’m sorry, you aren’t going to win this one kid.', 'Oh man, if you’re that condescending you must be right. My bad!', 'Since this thread is about SPYI, read page 18 of the prospectus:\n\nhttps://neosfunds.com/wp-content/uploads/SPYI-Prospectus.pdf\n\nYou’ll see that literally 90% of the dividend yield is coming from return of capital. You are paying 1% for NEOS to give your own money back to you since implied volatility has been so low this year.']"

Required info to start understanding options:

* [Call option Investopedia video](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp) basically a call option allows you to buy 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (strike price), but without the obligation to buy
* [Put option Investopedia video](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp) a put option allows you to sell 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (strike price), but without the obligation to sell
* Writing options switches the obligation to you and you'll be forced to buy someone else's shares (writing puts) or sell your shares (writing calls)

IONQ, as the market leader, will probably take at least 40% of this. So call it $400B in sales. Assume they have gross margins rivaling NVDA, say 70%. That's $280B in annual earnings by 2035. Currently IONQ does -52M in profit (as they inflect toward profitability). Assuming they get halfway there by 2030, or $140B in net income. They have 211M shares outstanding, but assume this quadruples for their massive capital expansion. That gets you to $165 in EPS by 2030.

42,Class action lawsuits have been raised against ASML - is it frivolous?,"Firstly, apologies for my English, it's not my first language.

My stock broker have sent me several notifications regarding class action lawsuits being levied against ASML after the last earnings report. The following are the ones I am aware of:

**11/20 - Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman LLC.**  
The complaint alleges ASML misrepresentet or failed to disclose that: (1) the issues being faced by suppliers, like ASML, in the semiconductor industry were much more severe than ASML had indicated to investors, (2) the pace of recovery of sales in the semiconductor industry was much slower than Defendants had publicy acknowledged; (3) ASML had created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to anticipated growth, while downplaying risk from macroeconomic and industry fluctiatinos, as well as stronger regulations restricting the export of semiconductor technology.

**11/20 - Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP.**

The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company's business, operation and prospects

**11/19 - Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP.**

**11/19 - The Law Offices of Frank R. Cruz**

**11/19 - Law Offices of Howard G. Smith**

**11/19 - Rosen Law Firm**

**11/19 - Pomerantz Law Firm**

**11/19 - Schall Law Firm**

**11/19 - Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossman**

Have also done the same with similar allegations raised against ASML. Now, it seemed to me after the earnings report that while it was not exactly a good one, I've never really assumed there was any misleading being done. Sometimes you raise guidance, sometimes you lower guidance. 

  
I assume my broker have an obligation to notify me of all of these class action lawsuits, but I've not really seen any discussion about them on any on the forums or news sites I follow, which makes me suspect this perhaps is not such a big deal? I am however not very knowledgeable on American law regarding these kinds of lawsuits.

What is your opinion? Have there been any misdirection from ASML or is this frivolous?

43,Adani Group shares nosedive after chairman Gautam Adani charged with fraud in New York,"India’s Adani Group saw shares of its companies plunge Thursday after its billionaire chairman Gautam Adani was indicted in a New York federal court over his alleged involvement in an extensive bribery and fraud operation.

The 62-year-old billionaire and the seven other defendants have been accused of paying over $250 million in bribes to Indian government officials to secure solar energy contracts that could generate more than $2 billion in profits.

The Indian group’s flagship firm Adani Enterprises fell 10%, while the company in the eye of the storm Adani Green Energy tanked 17.28%. Adani Energy fell 20%. 

Adani Power lost 13.81%, Adani Port’s share price dropped 10%, while the group’s retail arm Adani Wilmar shed 7.87%.

The benchmark NSE Nifty 50 Index slid 0.63% in its first hour of trade.

Adani, along with two executives from Adani Green Energy Limited — his nephew Sagar Adani and Vneet Jaain — have been charged with misleading U.S. and international investors about the company’s adherence to antibribery and anticorruption standards while raising over $3 billion to finance energy projects.

The five-count indictment in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn also accused Ranjit Gupta and Rupesh Agarwal, former executives of the renewable energy firm Azure Power Global, along with three former employees of the Canadian institutional investor Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec — Saurabh Agarwal, Cyril Cabanes, and Deepak Malhotra.

CDPQ said it is aware of the charges filed. “Those employees were all terminated in 2023 and CDPQ is cooperating with U.S. authorities,” the investor said in an email.

This comes after the conglomerate spent the bulk of last year attempting to move beyond the allegations of accounting fraud and “brazen stock manipulation” made by shortseller firm Hindenburg Research. 

“Since releasing our January 2023 report identifying Adani as the largest corporate con in history, we have never wavered in our view, nor has Adani ever refuted our findings,” Hindenburg said in a statement to CNBC on Thursday.

The conglomerate had rebutted the claims, adding that it has “always been in compliance with all laws.”

These charges do not change the “strong underlying fundamentals” of India’s market or the country’s growth trajectory, said Raymond James’ head of advisory solutions and market strategy, Matt Orton. 

“Once the dust settles, there will be even better opportunities for long-term investors in India,” he said.

Record quarterly revenue of $35.1 billion, up 17% from Q2 and up 94% from a year ago

Record quarterly Data Center revenue of $30.8 billion, up 17% from Q2 and up 112% from a year ago

SANTA CLARA, Calif., Nov. 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today reported revenue for the third quarter ended October 27, 2024, of $35.1 billion, up 17% from the previous quarter and up 94% from a year ago.

For the quarter, GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.78, up 16% from the previous quarter and up 111% from a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.81, up 19% from the previous quarter and up 103% from a year ago.

“The age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to NVIDIA computing,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Demand for Hopper and anticipation for Blackwell — in full production — are incredible as foundation model makers scale pretraining, post-training and inference.

“AI is transforming every industry, company and country. Enterprises are adopting agentic AI to revolutionize workflows. Industrial robotics investments are surging with breakthroughs in physical AI. And countries have awakened to the importance of developing their national AI and infrastructure,” he said.

NVIDIA will pay its next quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per share on December 27, 2024, to all shareholders of record on December 5, 2024.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gvzyeh/nvidia_earnings_beat_across_the_board_strong/,"['Nvidia is going to keep beating earnings and growing for as long as the data centers are growing\n\nThis trend is unlikely to change in 2025', 'Nvidia beats, sells off, jumps to new highs.

47,"Target shares plunge 20% after discounter cuts forecast, posts biggest earnings miss in two years","[Target](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TGT/) on Wednesday missed Wall Street’s quarterly earnings and revenue expectations and posted only a slight uptick in customer traffic, despite the discounter’s price cuts on thousands of items and its early holiday sale. 

The big-box retailer reversed course and cut its full-year profit guidance, just three months after [hiking that forecast](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/21/target-tgt-q2-2024-earnings.htm). It said it expects full-year adjusted earnings per share to range from $8.30 to $8.90. That’s [lower than the $9 to $9.70 per share range](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/21/target-tgt-q2-2024-earnings.html) that it shared in August and below the $9.55 a share expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.

Target now expects fourth-quarter comparable sales to be approximately flat. That metric, which is also known as same-store sales, includes sales on its website and stores open at least 13 months. 

Target fell short of Wall Street’s earnings per share estimate by 20%, its biggest miss in two years. It also marked its first revenue miss since August 2023.

Extract: The first vulnerability relates to financial markets, which remain susceptible to sudden, sharp adjustments. While recent high-volatility episodes were short-lived and had only limited impact on the financial system, underlying vulnerabilities make financial markets prone to bouts of volatility in the future. First, record-low equity premia and compressed corporate bond spreads are signs that investors may be underestimating the likelihood and potential impact of adverse scenarios. Second, concentration of equity market capitalisation and earnings among a handful of companies, notably in the United States, has increased greatly in recent years, raising concerns over the possibility of an asset price bubble connected to artificial intelligence. Given how deeply integrated global equity markets are, negative firm-specific or sector-specific surprises could easily spill-over across the borders.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gvls9p/ecb_warning_on_equity_and_sovereign_debt_risk/,"[""Uff, these Europoors can keep their opinion to themselves.

52,Insider trading,"You hear about members of congress doing such things, but how often does it actually happen? Given there are thousands of publicly listed companies in the US what is stopping the management, and people who get info before it’s released to the public, from trading the info or selling it to their friends? Does it get prosecuted as often as we like to believe or does the SEC not really care about it?

""Nonpublic"" implies a confidentiality requirement to keep the information private, such as what officers of a corporation might have. They are free to trade on information they come across because it is material but not nonpublic. Let\'s illustrate this with a few examples.\n\n>If an analyst for an investment bank calls an executive at a company and asks specific questions about the company\'s upcoming earnings, and the executive answers 1) honestly, 2) without suggesting a quid pro quo and 3) without requiring a promise of confidentiality and non-use from the analyst; then the analyst is free to use that data for personal gain, because legally the executive has effectively made this information public. There is a legal grey area of an executive giving information without that requirement, then calling the analyst up and trying to enforce confidentiality after the fact, but that\'s really an edge case and isn\'t relevant here.\n\n>If I am employed at a semiconductor company and in the course of my professional work I discover that a publicly traded company lost a huge contract, and I lead the way to securing that contract for my company, then 1) it is illegal for me to trade my own company\'s stock in response (I am an insider and have a confidentiality relationship), but 2) it is perfectly legal for me to short that other company, because I have no confidentiality relationship with them (assuming my employer doesn\'t restrict this, which they might - read your NDAs carefully.)\n\n>If your work involves heading out to solar panel fields to repair them, and you\'ve been all over the country and draw certain well-founded conclusions about the health of a company that manufactures these things, yes, you are allowed to trade on that data legally (again, in the absence of another employment agreement requiring that you do not, which establishes confidentiality). If your company is set to profit from this, no, you can\'t trade your own company\'s stock - that generally constitutes illegal inside trading.\n\n>If I am sitting in a Starbucks and I overhear two executives who happen to be talking about their companies merging, and this information has not yet been released to the public, I am allowed to trade on this information. The information was obtained in a public setting without a covenant of confidentiality established prior to my discovery. Conversely, if I see them in the Starbucks and bribe them for information, I am not allowed to trade on the information, because I established a quid pro quo with people who do have a confidentiality relationship.\n\n>Insider trading is extremely nuanced and extremely widely misunderstood. It is so misunderstood and so nuanced, that Matt Levine (a columnist at Bloomberg who writes ""Money Stuff"") has a habit of writing about all the weird developments in insider trading case law and odd edge cases that come up, because they\'re complex enough to make a frequent appearance in a finance column. The media (as an aggregate group reporting on this subject) has fixated on the idea that Congress is exempt from insider trading, but that is not factual. It doesn\'t help that there is a strong ideological sentiment against the finance industry which, regardless of whether or not it\'s well-founded (I\'m not going to comment on that), somewhat muddies the water when laypeople are looking for legitimate misconduct; this is especially prevalent when combined with the fact that most people simply don\'t understand what Wall Street does aside from the odd picture of a bunch of guys yelling in the middle of an exchange floor here and there (it does quite a lot!). As an academic concept in the legal and financial spheres, insider trading and mundane research could be thought of as a Venn diagram with some, but not total (nor even majority) overlap. The public conception of insider trading is that anything you find out in a professional context that, say, your friends and family don\'t know is illegal to use. This is made worse by the portrayal of insider trading in movies and television - that\'s absolutely not the case.', 'When you have congress sitting on committees that directly relate to stocks they can own, yah I’m sure their decisions are not bias.

But the main issue with that is that my friend can easily open an account in another brokerage/platform and do whatever he wants.

53,Trading SPY for gains,"First time posting, long time lurking.

I had some money ($8k only) sitting at a HYSA and earning 4% interest.
Decided to buy $8k SPY and harvest profit on a day to day basis (meaning, if stock goes up, I withdraw gains. If it goes down, I do nothing).

My HYS was returning $25+ per month. I made $60 in 2 days. And kept $8k on SPY.

What am I missing here? Even if I stop now and don’t sell for the whole month, I still did better than HYSA. 

Are there tax implications (or complications) for realizing lots of micro short term gains? 
I believe the tax bracket of HYSA and short term gains is the same. 
Will my tax be too complicated to file if I keep doing these micro profit withdrawals?

Honestly, I am a new investor (trader?), have been doing index funds and NVDA for less than 1 year (401k solid, maxed out every year, for 8+ years)

54,Okta - my analysis and thoughts,"I'd appreciate any and all feedback to see if I feel I'm on track or not and your perspective on my take. I know Okta took the hit after the social engineering ""hack"", but there's no doubt they're still the leader in the IAM space. I believe there's way more upside, but I also realize that they \*could\* be a serious M&A target.

**Executive Investment Summary: Okta, Inc.**

**Overview**

Okta, Inc. is a leading provider of identity and access management (IAM) solutions, serving enterprises globally with secure authentication systems. Its strong revenue growth, cash flow, and leadership in the cybersecurity market make it an attractive acquisition target.



***Key Financial Highlights***

\- Revenue (TTM): $2.45 billion, reflecting 16.2% YoY growth.

\- Profitability:

\- Net Income: -$136 million (improved from -$355 million YoY).

\- EBITDA: -$145 million.

\- Cash Flow Positive: Despite unprofitability, generating $607M in free cash flow.

\- Cash Position: $2.2 billion; current ratio of 1.83 (strong liquidity).

\- Debt Profile: $1.297 billion in total debt; net debt of $820 million (manageable).

\- Market Cap: \~$12–15 billion.

\- Valuation Multiples: Acquisition valuation estimated at $16–18 billion, reflecting 6–9x revenue multiples.



**Strategic Acquisition Rationale**



Market Opportunity

The IAM market is expanding due to hybrid work and zero-trust security models. Okta’s leadership in this high-demand space adds immediate value to acquirers.



Synergies

1. Revenue Synergies:

\- Cross-selling within SaaS, cloud, and cybersecurity ecosystems.

\- Increases customer retention via integrated security offerings.

2. Cost Synergies:

\- Consolidation of R&D, sales, and administrative functions.



**Tax Advantages**

1. Net Operating Losses (NOLs):

\- Okta’s significant NOLs can offset taxable income for the acquirer under U.S. tax rules (IRC Section 382), reducing the acquirer’s overall tax burden.

\- For cash-flow-positive acquirers like *Microsoft* or *Salesforce*, this could be an immediate financial benefit.

2. R&D Tax Credits:

\- Okta’s investment in IAM technology qualifies for R&D tax credits, which the acquirer can leverage to reduce tax liability.

3. Capital Gains Protection:

\- If the acquirer has large realized gains in 2024, purchasing Okta could offset these with acquisition-related costs.



Timing Considerations

2024: Lower valuation; earlier synergies and immediate tax benefits from NOLs.

2025: Higher valuation but lower operational risk as Okta achieves profitability milestones.



**Potential Acquirers and Recommendations**

Acquirer: Microsoft

Timing Recommendation: Acquire in 2024

Why? Integrates into Azure AD; removes a competitor; strengthens security leadership. Early acquisition maximizes synergies and tax advantages from Okta’s NOLs.



Acquirer: Google (Alphabet)

Timing Recommendation: Wait until 2025

Why? Conservative M&A approach; IAM complements Google Cloud; may prefer profitability first.



Acquirer: Amazon (AWS)

Timing Recommendation: Wait until 2025

Why? Less urgent; would act only if Microsoft or others make a move.



Acquirer: Salesforce

Timing Recommendation: Acquire in 2024

2025: $18–22 billion, assuming profitability.



Stock Price Impact

2024 Acquisition:

\- Stock Price Range: $95.81–$107.78 per share.

\- Upside: +29% to +45% (from \~$74.51 current price).



2025 Acquisition:

\- Stock Price Range: $107–$130 per share.

\- Upside: +44% to +75%.



**Final Recommendation**



For Acquirers

2024 Acquisition:

\- Microsoft, Salesforce, Cisco: Act now to secure market share, synergies, and tax advantages while Okta is undervalued.



2025 Acquisition:

\- Google, Amazon: Wait for profitability milestones, reducing operational risks.



For Stockholders

Hold the stock for potential 29–75% upside over the next 12–18 months through organic growth or an acquisition.

**Conclusion**

Okta is a prime acquisition target with robust growth potential, strategic synergies, and significant tax advantages for tech giants. While aggressive acquirers like Microsoft, Salesforce, and Cisco should act in 2024 to maximize these benefits, more conservative companies like Google and Amazon may wait until 2025 for improved profitability metrics. Either way, Okta presents a compelling investment with projected stock price increases of $95–$130 per share.

56,Trying to understand the mechanics/risk of SGOV vs short term treasuries Money Market vs a HYSA and their relative safety.,"I recently have started using SGOV in my brokerage as a savings account which I pay my bills against to minimize idle cash in low returning accounts.  The returns are between 4.5-5.5% in the recent interest rate markets which is better than my High yield savings account (HYSA) so I basically have discontinued using my HYSA and just use SGOV.  I don't think I fully understand the risk after talking to a Schwab advisor so hoping to get some insight.  For comparison, here are 3 different yet similar investment vehicles that I am comparing:

1. SGOV: an ETF that is 99% invested in ultra short term treasuries; 30 day yield of 4.74%.  High liquidity as I can instantly buy/sell during market hours.  Share price increases throughout the month and then decreases on the 1st when they turn over their bonds and pay the difference in dividends.  Interest is 99% tax free at the state level due to Treasury holdings.
2. MM (SWSBX): a Schwab money market account; 30 day yield of 4.29%.  Schwab acts as middle man and fixes price at $1 per share, uses their resources to ensure stability during chaotic events.  Higher liquidity as money settles in 24 hrs.  Interest is paid directly to the account.  Interest is largely tax free at the state level due to holdings.
3. HYSA: a high yield savings account; 30 day yield of 4.65%.  Bank acts as a middle man with my money, investing it in Treasuries and Bonds and paying me a return.  Benefit: FDIC insurance.  Drawback: slow liquidity if I need to move money around quickly.  Interest is subject to State and Federal taxes.

The Schwab advisor was trying to say that SGOV is not negligible risk because it is an ETF so supply/demand sentiment can rapidly fluctuate the share price just like S&P500.  He said that this is because it is a closed end traded fund so it has a fixed number of shares that correspond to the projected value of the underlying bonds and therefore is sensitive to rapid shifts in buying and selling to balance the traded price.  Google says it is has an open ended structure same as the money market, so this already seems wrong.  I have noticed certain days I'll have a small (0.05%) loss although it does provide the anticipated 30day yield over the course of the month.  I assumed these minor losses were from buying/selling of the underlying bonds that have mismatched maturity intervals (1 weeks vs 4 week, etc).

It seems to me that there are the following risks:

1. Government / Treasury insolvency: if something like this happens it seems that all 3 of these vehicles are equally in trouble as well as FDIC insurance, so I'm not really concerned about this.
2. ETF Management Fraud: this seems like the main risk, if the SGOV board was committing fraud and not actually allocating 99% of its resources to treasuries.  The risk feels pretty low on this though but it would be unique to SGOV.
3. Return Rate Fluctuation:  If federal interest rates suddenly drop, it seems all 3 vehicles would be equally impacted although some maybe more quickly than others.  Therefore, I'm not really concerned about this either.  This also would only impact future returns not your principle.
4. Black Swan Event:  If something happened like war or pandemic outbreak and a massive shift in outflows occurred, what would happen?  Would SGOV plummet, MM be protected through Schwab backing, and HYSA be unaffected and protected with FDIC?  This is my primary concern.

TLDR:  Is it possible for SGOV return a negative value?  I understand its return is sensitive to underlying short term treasury bond prices but can you lose your principle?",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gvawfq/trying_to_understand_the_mechanicsrisk_of_sgov_vs/,"[""Good questions, I also use SGOV to store my collateral for CSPs right now so I'm curious to check back for answers.\xa0"", 'Always very short term risk with them. If the rates suddenly go up, early in the month, that means the bond they bought at say 4.5 % could be bought at say a price of 5.5% because of a Fed hike for example, then the present value of those bonds could drop over 1% suddenly. They will still go up the 4.5 % by the end of the month. But you are open to a rare and short term price drop, especially early in the month.', "">risk because it is an ETF so supply/demand sentiment can rapidly fluctuate the share price just like S&P500\n\nETFs are structured to have 'creation units', which allow institutions to buy or sell blocks of the fund's securities to arbitrage any difference to NAV.

So, if rates popped 1 percentage point overnight, the NAV of the fund would only drop 0.1%', 'This makes sense, however is there any risk from large ETF outflows like the Schwab rep made it sound?  I thought it would be protected due to being an open ended structure and the theory that the same underlying bond interest is being distributed among the shareholders so there should be an increase in amount of interest paid to a lower number of shareholders if many people exit the ETF at once since underlying is not changing?  Not sure I have this correct though...', 'If it is an ETF then I believe the shares are created and redeemed by Authorized Participants to profit and keep the share price in line with the index so there is no change in the ratio of interest payments per share.\n\nThe risk differences are that a money market has an implicit guarantee not to ""break the buck"" and it very very rarely happens so if you buy a dollar you can sell for a dollar, an FDIC savings account you will \'always\' get your dollar back, a bond ETF composed of Treasuries you will get the interest on the bonds but you if you want to get your dollar back you will have to find someone to sell your share to for the same price you bought it for. They are all really low risk but if you look at a chart of the price of the ETF it isn\'t a dollar bought a dollar sold.', ""The risk is that some specific day it might go -.01%\n\nAnd if you really need cash that one day you'll suffer Horribly!\n\nJokes aside.

57,"Qualcomm says it expects $4 billion in PC chip sales by 2029, as company gets traction beyond smartphones","Qualcomm said on Tuesday that it expects its push into new markets to generate an additional $22 billion per year by 2029.

Of that amount, roughly $4 billion will come from PC chips, Qualcomm said at its investor day on Tuesday. The chipmaker just introduced PC processors earlier this year, when it released Snapdragon X for Windows devices.

The latest forecast marks an important milestone for Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon, who took over the company in 2021 with a promise to get past a reliance on smartphones. In fiscal 2024, Qualcomm’s handset business reported $24.86 billion in sales, about 75% of its entire chip business.

Qualcomm also said on Tuesday that automotive revenues would rise about 175% by 2029 to $8 billion, of which 80% is tied to contracts that have already been secured.

*″*We have been on this trajectory realizing that the technologies we have developed over the many years can be very relevant to a number of different industries beyond mobile,” Amon said at the investor event.

Another $4 billion in revenue will come from industrial chips and $2 billion will come from chips for headsets, a category Qualcomm calls XR. About $4 billion of the forecast is a catch-all for other chip sales, like those for wireless headphones and tablets.

Qualcomm shares are up 16% this year, trailing the Nasdaq, which has gained 26%.

Qualcomm grew rapidly over the past decade as its modems and processors became essential parts for high-end smartphones, especially those running Google Android. Qualcomm also sells modems and related parts to Apple for its iPhones.

But the company has warned investors that Apple could choose to stop buying Qualcomm parts as soon as 2027. Qualcomm said on Tuesday that its growing businesses will more than offset any losses from Apple.

Qualcomm’s strategy under Amon has been to use the technology its developed for its handset chips, like modems, processors, and AI accelerators, in new markets, including cars, PCs, and virtual reality. The investor event was the first time in years that the company has given a forecast for those new markets. Qualcomm said its total addressable market is as large as $900 billion.

“We put a strategy in ’21, and we’re not changing our strategy,” Amon said.

Laptop and desktop chips are currently dominated by Intel, which has over 70% percent of the market, according to Mercury Research. Intel reported $29 billion in PC chip sales in its 2023.

“The competitive landscape changed between the Windows and Macs,” Amon said, referring to Apple’s move in 2020 to switch from Intel to its own processors. “We saw that as an opportunity, especially as the ecosystem did not have confidence in the existing players to actually deliver a solution.”

The forecast for XR headsets also hints at the growth potential of the VR market over the next five years. Qualcomm supplies chips to many of the top headset makers, including Meta for its Quest and Ray-Bans products.

When it comes to artificial intelligence, Qualcomm calls itself an “edge AI” company, in contrast to cloud-based AI that’s typically powered by Nvidia processors. Company officials didn’t rule out introducing data center products in an interview with CNBC.

Qualcomm suggested that its mobile chips will be able to run the kind of advanced AI that’s restricted to large server farms today, an indication that that company may benefit from the AI boom down the road as the technology becomes more efficient.

“What you can run on the cloud last year, you can run on the device this year,” Durga Malladi, Qualcomm’s senior vice president in charge of planning, said at the event.

58,"Palantir short thesis and an analysis of its current earnings power, multiples and enterprise value","Hello friends. I hope you all spent your weekend counting the profit you made on your puts on friday. This is a long analysis with a position at the end. I will discuss Palantir and its recent explosion in share price, as well as their current earnings, multiples on said earnings and their enterprise value. I recognize that this is /r investing and thus short selling is not within everyone's risk profile. I hope it may also be of some value for those who are thinking of investing in palantir.

So here’s something you may have read somewhere: Palantir is on a meteoric rise and has made a lot of you good fellows fabulously wealthy (right…?). Since 2021 this stock has been a retail favorite and this is in large part for good reason. I’m not going to recap the business model here but the company has its foot in many o’ business  segments and has been bagging contracts left and right. They showed strong revenue growth, increasing margins (they turned GAAP profitable last year, a major milestone) and have enticed investors with promises of strong growth going forward. It is obviously a company that, for the right price, you want to be a part of.

Key phrase: *for the right price*. I am not allergic to growth investing and have often stomached high valuations if a company has an unrivaled business model and there is a strong enough runway for growth to eventually catch up with said high valuation. But I would like to make a case for Palantir being overvalued. In fact, the term overvalued does not even begin to scratch the surface of how incredibly bloated Palantir’s stock is.

For starters, let’s take into consideration palantir’s enterprise value. Despite the stock price rising roughly 50% versus its 2021 peak, Palantir’s enterprise value has ballooned much more.

*2021 peak enterprise value:* $60B at around $37 per share  
*17/11/2024 enterprise value:* $146B at around $64 per share

This is due to the increasing number of shares outstanding. In December 2020, Palantir had 978M shares outstanding. This has risen to 2.2 billion as of their most recent filing. While palantirs growth has certainly been impressive, it is worth looking at this in the context of their increased share count. Their revenue per share metrics have been the following.

End of 2020: *$1.12*  
2021: *$0.80*  
2022: *$0.92*  
*2*023: *$1.04*  
LTM: *$1.19* 

Palantir has only recently recaptured its revenue-per-share number that it had by the end of 2020. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it needs to be placed into the context of this being a perceived *growth* stock. Yes, revenue is increasing - but the amount of shares outstanding has historically kept pace with this revenue increase. As a shareholder, your claim on this revenue has historically not risen proportionally compared to its revenue growth.

Likewise, their profitability can also paint a distorted picture. Palantir adjusts the heck out of their earnings. If it is even at all possible to adjust it to paint a better picture, you better believe Karp & co will do so. Many of Palantirs shareholders are retail and cite the non-GAAP numbers as if they even remotely reflect reality. Their stock based compensation is obviously a massive expense and should be a huge red flag, but one of the most overlooked aspects I found is that of interest income. Palantir has a massive cash balance (gained through dilution - shocker, i know) that they invest in short term investments to gain interest income. This is of course nothing new, lots of companies do this. 

But consider this. In their last “blowout” quarter, Palantir gained $0.06 of GAAP EPS. This amounts to roughly $150M of net income, or about 1/1000th of their enterprise value. Of this number, $52M, or more than one third, was interest income. This is not a small footnote. Only $100M of their last quarterly earnings was actual, non-adjusted, no-nonsense operating income. Furthermore, they also paid only $7.8M of taxes on their income. This number is bound to increase over time as this is obviously a comically low tax rate. 

And then there is the valuation. Palantir trades at 55x EV / sales. This means that if *all* of Palantir’s revenue was after-tax profits and paid out as dividends, it would at their current revenues take until 2080 until investors recoup their investments. Their current EBIT margin is a little over 13%. That 55x number is mindblowingly expensive and it is almost impossible to come up with any scenario that doesnt require:

A) incredible and sustained growth in revenue

B) a steadily increasing margin, and

C) an unreasonably elevated market multiple and no collapse in overall stock market multiples for a long time

We all remember Stock McNealy’s (SUN microsystems CEO) iconic quote when he was reflecting on the dotcom bubble

*“At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don’t need any transparency. You don’t need any footnotes. What were you thinking?”*

This is somethine else entirely. 55 times sales is something that under almost no scenario can end well. Remember, you still need upside! It’s not just about justifying the current stock price, it’s about penciling out *enough upside* in the current stock price that would justify taking an extreme risk by holding this stock for an extended period of time. 

On friday, the stock market took a bath after roaring to new highs something like sixty times this year. Tesla, bitcoin and Palantir shrugged off the fear and continued to rise. Palantir added 11% and, with this move, added another five years of revenue to its elephant-sized market cap. This shows pretty clearly that Palantir is associated with meme-like risk assets. Who knows when the current market cap will reverse. It’s a game of liquidity. Musical chairs and all of the retail shareholders are playing. But one thing is clear: *their current EV / EBITDA is nearly 400x*. 

The amount of retail shareholders I see online that are convinced that this will go to $100 amazes me. My question is: Why? Based on what? Sure, it shoots up 5% a day and this leads everyone to believe it’s an amazing company. But long-term, this company has enormous shoes to fill. It is currently a penny masquerading as a $100 bill. Palantir holders are currently feasting on lobster and caviar but the bill will one day be due. And unless these guys accelerate their growth to 40% annually for a decade and increase their margins to Nvidia levels, there is only one way this ride will end. 

As it stands now, *all* of palantir’s equity is in the $5B cash position that they gained through dilution. Last quarter, the company earned $0.06 of GAAP EPS, of which $0.02 was interest income and only $0.04 was operating income. Aside from the $2 of equity per share, *all* of palantirs $65 share price is based on this $0.06 of earnings power and the future growth that the market is baking into this. In the future, growth will need to come from operating income as their cash position will not grow proportionally to keep 1/3rd of GAAP EPS in interest income. Their taxes will also go up in the future. If this is not a dotcom-level valuation, I do not know what is. 

If you currently buy a 10 year bond, you will net roughly 4.5% in interest annually. Palantirs stock nets you 1,8% - *in revenue!* 

All of this leads me to believe that this is a reasonable short opportunity. Thus, I am short for now, using graniteshares -3x Palantir (3SPA). The leveraged aspect of this product makes it vulnerable to decay if holding for long periods of time. Thus, I will look to acquire long-dated puts this week. Could get smoked some more, but that’s what makes a market.

60,Self driving is coming to your favourite cars,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to dive into Mobileye (MBLY) and its role in the self-driving car industry, especially concerning partnerships with major automakers. Let's break it down.

Company Overview:

Mobileye, a subsidiary of Intel, specializes in advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies. Their EyeQ® chips and software are integral to many vehicles' safety and automation features.

Key Partnerships:

Mobileye has secured collaborations with several major car manufacturers:

Volkswagen Group: In March 2024, Volkswagen announced a cooperation agreement with Mobileye to develop and supply software, hardware components, and digital maps for the self-driving ID. Buzz AD. 

Ford: Ford has integrated Mobileye's technology into its vehicles, enhancing their ADAS capabilities. 

Zeekr: The Chinese automaker Zeekr has collaborated with Mobileye to incorporate advanced driving technologies into its vehicles. 

Porsche: In May 2023, Porsche and Mobileye announced a collaboration to introduce Mobileye's SuperVision™ automated driver-assist functions in future Porsche sports cars. 


Recent Developments:

In November 2024, Lyft announced partnerships with Mobileye and other companies to integrate self-driving cars into its ride-hailing service. This collaboration aims to advance autonomous vehicle research and development, with plans to launch self-driving taxis in Atlanta next year. 

Financial Performance:

Mobileye's stock has experienced fluctuations. As of November 8, 2024, the stock price was $16.42. Analysts have mixed opinions, with some expressing concerns over growth prospects and competition. 

Future Outlook:

Mobileye's extensive partnerships position it as a significant player in the autonomous driving sector. However, the industry faces challenges, including regulatory hurdles, technological advancements, and competition from other tech companies and automakers developing in-house solutions.

61," UBER, Bright Future or Dim outlook?","UBER (Uber Technologies) has been beaten down quite a bit recently off the news that Donald Trump will make the barrier to entry for autonomous vehicles in the United States easier to get through, presumed from his newfound friendship with Elon Musk. Now relatively obviously UBER sold off quite a bit on this news, but I believe this isn't as bad as the market is making it out to be. I believe that Uber could easily survive mass adoptions of Autonomous Vehicles if they simply pivot to becoming the platform provider  this could be quite profitable for Uber and see their expenses come down greatly, as they no longer need to worry about paying for drivers. Uber currently sits at 4.10 FCF Yield (2.83% if you factor in SBC), and is growing FCF's at over a 100% YTD and Revenue 20% YTD. This is a rapidly growing company that's priced quite cheaply, and I believe that the downfall of UBER is greatly exagerated. If Uber can position themselves and continue their relationship with Waymo to be the platform provider, I think they're positioned very well for the adoption of Autonomous Vehicles. Would love to hear everybody's thoughts. (I own no position in UBER but am actively looking to start one soon at these prices)",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gv32bn/uber_bright_future_or_dim_outlook/,"[""Somewhere in the middle.  Autonomous on a massive scale is still a ways off. When that happens, Uber can perhaps find a place as a middleman but that's fragile and requires keeping car cos happy enough not to go off on their own. Uber can also clean/fix self driving cars, but that (which would require stations scattered all around) is a whole other business vs an asset light app.  Some talk that Uber was interested in EXPE and perhaps it tries to diversify (travel super app.)\n\nSo I think somewhere in the middle. I don't think Uber goes away by any means, but I can see Uber looking different/very different 5-10 years from now. Self-driving on a massive scale is still a long ways off, but I do think that it'll probably continue to be a cloud over Uber unless they can really provide a compelling vision for where they sit in transportation 5-10+ years from now.

Uber will manage and dispatch a fleet of Waymo's vehicles in selected major cities."", ""They have partnership with Waymo, Cruise and other small providers and even if self driving has mass adoption Tesla will not be the only player, it's a matter of time they try to operate on their own and find out it's a pain in the ass and would partner with Uber to dispatch, maintain and also support the rides...it's way to complicated to replicate Uber and operations whether Its self driving or human driven."", 'I own and I believe in the stock. It has many markets for growth, multiple sources of revenue and I believe that autonomous will not disrupt its platform how others are predicting.

Even when it becomes a thing, one bad incident will cause bad press and concerns for people. There’s also always going to be people that want an actual human driver.\n\nAs for Uber, I think they’ll be fine. They’re also investing into autonomous driving but also into other streams of revenue. I don’t own the company, but the outlook isn’t too dim.', 'UBER is oversold/underbought/a buy whatever you wish to call it.\n\nIn the short and medium term it is a financial powerhouse, having turned corner and hitting straightaways on revenues and margins.  They’ve broken away from the pack like Lyft and everyone else.  They have diversification.  They are international.  Taxi is fading away, Uber is the verb for all ride sharing, and increasingly, food delivery.\n\nTransportation from A to B isn’t a fad that ebbs and wanes, and Uber is entrenched.\n\nTheir last two ERs gave visibility into this power, yet other more random and transient factors have driven the recent sell off.\n\nThe perceived long term threat was from Tesla, but the many-times-delayed emperor’s fashion show that finally happened last month made it clear that Uber has several years of safety from that.\n\nI see many posts here worried about a futuristic world that’s years away.  Two things: One, a lot of money gets made waiting for the future to arrive.  Two, big rich incumbents tend to find ways of owning future developments that come along.\n\nOn that same front, Waymo is so clearly many years ahead of Tesla, and Uber is already partnered with Uber.\n\nShould the landscape and competitive environment truly change, there will time and opportunities to bail in and out as new information indicates.\n\n\nYou have to pass through the near future to get to the wildly distant future.  Uber stock got thrashed on the vaguest rumor of an EXPE travel merger, presumably because their exec used to work there.  But it never happened and yet the stock price hasn’t reset.  I think before we have flying cars and whatever else, Uber could do things that are more attainable and boring, but profitable.  Instead of flying cars, they could invade the logistics space.

Uber can consolidate both human and AV rides which makes more sense for users. I’d rather have one app than multiple. \n\nTheir fleet operations play makes it even relevant in the AV space.

Wouldn't MSFT be a better bet in tech?\xa0\n\n\nWon't speculate about self driving or economic recession (discretionary spending), but to me, Uber is no different from what Fiverr, eBay, Etsy is for freelancing or physical goods.

Using the Waymo app was almost identical to the Uber one. In an autonomous future Uber becomes the taxi dispatcher and dispatch your ride to Waymo, Zoox, or maybe a person? I guess...   \n  \nAutonomous at scale is a long way off but taking one from PHX to the hotel and back it was pretty easy to see a future where dense urban cores (and maybe suburbs too) are dominated by autonomous ridehailing vehicles... And you are right about the asset light, pivoting to being the AI mechanics and maintenance isn't going to be playing into Uber's core competancies."", 'Or Uber stays the exact same.

They just didn’t want to commit resources to create a new Uber and would rather focus on improving and testing self driving tech.\n\nSo I’d guess this partnership remains the way it is now, it’s still a win win for both.

62,"Sony is in talks to buy Kadokawa, media powerhouse behind 'Elden Ring'","NEW YORK/TOKYO, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Sony (6758.T), opens new tab is in talks to acquire Kadokawa (9468.T), opens new tab, the Japanese media powerhouse behind the “Elden Ring” game, two sources familiar with the matter said, as the technology giant looks to add to its entertainment portfolio.

The talks between the two sides are ongoing and, if successful, a deal could be signed in the coming weeks, the sources said.

Sony already has a 2% stake in Kadokawa and a stake in Kadokawa controlled FromSoftware, the developer of the hit fantasy action role-playing game.

Kadokawa is a huge player in Japan. I would say this is almost the equivalent of Disney buying Fox in the West. They’re not just the parent company behind ‘Elden Ring,’ they’re a anime, manga, light novel, and magazine publisher. They also produce and distribute anime and video games. They also have their hands in the music industry.

The Company’s low Earth orbit (“LEO”) satellite constellation ensures secure data transmission for connecting and protecting assets, transmitting critical operational data, and saving lives for consumers, businesses, and government agencies across the globe. Globalstar’s terrestrial spectrum, Band 53, and its 5G variant, n53, offer carriers, cable companies, and system integrators a versatile, fully licensed channel for private networks with a growing ecosystem to improve customer wireless connectivity, while Globalstar’s XCOM RAN product offers significant capacity gains in dense wireless deployments. In addition to SPOT GPS messengers, Globalstar offers next-generation internet of things (“IoT”) hardware and software products for efficiently tracking and monitoring assets, processing smart data at the edge, and managing analytics with cloud-based telematics solutions to drive safety, productivity, and profitability.\n\nAs I have read in some other articles, Globalstar is part of Apples emergency response feature for SOS and rescue operations.  Apple probably will never let them fail, so they have support, but they are also creating a satellite network to deploy for communities in the developing world, to bring internet and communication services for the public, government and defense sectors.', 'We as us holders who’ are holding till full constellation , how is this a question lol', 'NuScale doesn’t have any construction or operating licenses, you are only pointing to their design certification. In order for their customer to obtain those, it requires a 24-36 month NRC review period that **has not been initiated yet**. This is why your second link is projecting deployment in 2029 (read the subheader) which is two years behind OKLO’ 2027 target and that’s probably being optimistic. We’ll have a better idea once their customers actually start the NRC review for those.\n\nThe reason why OKLO is so much further ahead is because they are submitting a COLA, which seeks approval for design, construction and operating, only taking them 24 months. Compare this to NuScale where **every customer** needs to create and submit detailed plans, then wait 24-36 months for build and operating licenses.', '> life savings\n\n> discipline\n\nAre you sure about that', 'Thanks!', 'Interesting insight, thanks\n\nWhat seems off for me here is Why woudnt NuScale go for COLA then?

If I put it in a stock that was akin to gambling, such as MicroStrategy or video game store, then that would not be discipline.', 'You bet, good discussion for sure!\n\nIt’s a strategic choice by NuScale and Nano Nuclear to sell designs only and not be an ‘owner and operator’ like Oklo. They would have to commit to the responsibility of building and running the reactors themselves, which does come with additional hurdles and liability, but allows for **much** faster scaling.\n\nRecently, the NRC released a white paper stating that once Oklo has the reference (first) application approved, it would only take as little as 7 months to get approval on subsequent applications, or new site builds which further accelerates the timelines.\n\nI’d recommend the subreddit r/OKLOSTOCK, I’m a moderator over there and we discuss many SMR-related topics, not only Oklo.', 'Thank you! I’ll definitely head over there to see what people are thinking\n\nI just saw on wikipedia that OKLO had the COLA application rejected  in 2022, is there much that changed since then and isnt that worrying for you?', 'NRC said that the rejection in 2022 was without prejudice and based on a lack of “case studies” provided. Since May’s SPAC, they are in a much better cash and staffing position and have been preparing for resubmission during Q1-Q2 of next year. I’m confident that they will gain acceptance and deploy in 2027, not to mention that OKLO’s board member, Chris Wright was just selected by Trump to be the Secretary of Energy. They stand to greatly benefit from further regulatory streamlining and “cutting of red tape”. There’s always executional risk here, but I’m confident in their leadership team.', 'Cant argue with the Trump argument here, but can you really make laws that benefit only OKLO and not make it easier for NuScale to get them going faster too?', 'It will for sure benefit all players within the industry, it just seems to me that the owner & operator model stands to benefit the most during the hyper-scaling projected for 2030s. Oklo can project finance all their builds through future reactor cash flows too, which will allow them to scale similarly to an early day AMZN or UBER to dominate market share.\n\nEdit: They also stand to benefit from their nuclear recycling expertise too, which sets them apart. This is especially true during the current HALEU shortage.']"

It is headquartered in Switzerland. Berry Global has a market cap of 7 Billion and a PE of 14.  The main office will remain in Switzerland.  Based on the statistics provided by the companies, this merger appears to be beneficial to both companies.', 'Anyone know about the cultural compatibility of the two companies?', ""I worked at Amcor in the past and my buddy has worked at Berry. There will be no issues here. They both do the same thing in a lot of the similar places. \nMy father worked for amcor/bemis/perfecseal/curwood for 24 years. These places make packaging for almost everything we consume. Both companies product lines are similar and the cost of materials (resin pellets) is simply passed to costumers who pass it to consumers. Oil and resin is cheap right now so plastic packaging is still a cost saver for companies. I work at Tyson foods now and if you walk through any grocery store or health secrion you look at the product of both a thousand times. My father was never laid off, never restricted hourly at work, and unionized. Because plastic has a good shelf life they can process it at a constant rate and store excess during a slowdown and then make bank when times are good. The equipment to process is expensive and massive. This means there is a huge barrier of entry for new competitors and the product does not ship overseas well. (Heat-Humidity-Handling-Logistics) This means these companies are protected well from foriegn competition. However there is a massive oppertunity for the expansion into new markets. It is a solid investment.\n\nIn working at Tyson in maintenance I have learned from equipment representatives that they are experiencing heavy demand for products that use amcor film. As in 3x what it was 5 years ago. They can't build the machines that use this stuff fast enough. Food packaging needs some form of plastic or can to keep out air and aluminum and steel cans are far more expensive than plastic. You do get great shelf life with a steel can but who is predictting explosive growth in canned goods? lol. I work in food and plastic is gooing to be used for the foreseeable future. This is just one branch of the business. \nI view both as good companies to buy and believe this deal is going through for sure. I think they waited for the election to know for sure it was going to succeed. Berry at the current price is a steal up to at least 75. The business isn't going anywhere and the combined company will be more effiecent and have less competition."", 'Im a molding machine maintenance tech at berry. The people that work at the amcor down the road are all working 12hr days, weekends ten on ten off. They aren’t allowed tobacco on company premises. Etc etc. People come to my plant to escape amcor. I really hope this goes okay but I am now probably going to keep my options open.']"

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

70,Super Micro hires new auditor to maintain Nasdaq listing; shares pop 23%,"Embattled server maker Super Micro Computer said on Monday that it’s hired BDO as its new auditor and submitted a plan to Nasdaq detailing its efforts to regain compliance with the exchange. The shares jumped 23% in extended trading.

“This is an important next step to bring our financial statements current, an effort we are pursuing with both diligence and urgency,” Super Micro CEO Charles Liang said in a statement.

Super Micro is late in filing its 2024 year-end report with the SEC, and said earlier this month that it was looking for a new accountant after its previous auditor, Ernst & Young, stepped down in October. Ernst & Young was new to the job, having just replaced Deloitte & Touche as Super Micro’s accounting firm in March 2023.

Super Micro said it told Nasdaq that it believes it will be able to file its annual report for the year ended June 30, and quarterly report for the period ended Sept. 30. The company said it will remain listed on the Nasdaq pending the exchange’s “review of the compliance plan.”

Shares of Super Micro soared more than twentyfold over a two year period from early 2022 until their peak in March of this year. But the stock has been hammered on troubling news about its compliance with Nasdaq. Once valued at about $70 billion, the company’s market cap was at $12.6 billion at the close on Monday, following a 16% rally during regular trading.

Super Micro has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence boom, due to its relationship with Nvidia. Sales last fiscal year more than doubled to $15 billion.

On Monday, Super Micro announced that it was selling products featuring Nvidia’s next-generation AI chip called Blackwell. The company competes with vendors like Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise in packaging up Nvidia AI chips for other companies to access.

Super Micro was added to the S&P 500 in March, reflecting its rapidly growing business and then-soaring stock price. Less than two weeks after the index changes were announced, Super Micro reached its closing high of $118.81.

The troubles began within months. In August, Super Micro said it wouldn’t file its annual report with the SEC on time. Noted short seller Hindenburg Research then disclosed a short position in the company, and said in a report that it identified “fresh evidence of accounting manipulation.” The Wall Street Journal later reported that the Department of Justice was at the early stages of a probe into the company.

The month after announcing its report delay, Super Micro said it had received a notification from the Nasdaq, indicating that the delay in the filing of its annual report meant the company wasn’t in compliance with the exchange’s listing rules. Super Micro said the Nasdaq’s rules allowed the company 60 days to file its report or submit a plan to regain compliance. Based on that timeframe, the deadline was Monday.

71,My research and direction of McD,"I have already posted the my intro and intent on my first thread. Linking it here so I dont repeat myself.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gtrdjh/my\_research\_and\_direction\_of\_abnb/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gtrdjh/my_research_and_direction_of_abnb/)

  
**TLDR:** Short term short. I don't have an opinion on long term for this stock.

I will be entering the options route :  270 Put 17th Jan 2025.

My Due Diligence / Research for McDonald's Corporation (MCD)



**1. Fundamental Analysis:**

**a) Valuation:**

\- Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio: Currently at 25.5x, which is higher than the industry average of 23.2x, suggesting potential overvaluation.

\- Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio: At 8.2x, significantly higher than the industry average of 3.1x, indicating the stock may be priced too aggressively relative to its sales.



**b) Revenue Growth:**

\- McDonald's revenue growth has been sluggish in recent years, with a 5-year average growth rate of just 0.8%.

\- The company faces increasing competition from fast-casual dining options and changing consumer preferences toward healthier food choices.



**c) Margin Pressure:**

\- Rising labor costs and commodity prices are putting pressure on McDonald's profit margins.

\- The company's operating margin has remained relatively flat over the past few years, suggesting limited ability to improve profitability.



**d) Debt Levels:**

\- McDonald's has a high debt-to-equity ratio of 3.17, which is significantly above the industry average of 1.2.

\- This high leverage increases the company's financial risk and may limit its ability to invest in growth initiatives or weather economic downturns.



**e) Market Saturation:**

\- McDonald's has limited room for expansion in developed markets, where it already has a significant presence.

\- Growth in emerging markets may be challenging due to local competition and changing consumer preferences.



**2. Technical Analysis:**

**a) Trend Analysis:**

\- The stock has been in an uptrend for an extended period, potentially setting up for a reversal.

\- The 50-day moving average is showing signs of flattening, which could indicate a loss of momentum.



**b) Relative Strength Index (RSI):**

\- The RSI is currently near overbought territory (above 70), suggesting the stock may be due for a pullback.



**c) Volume Analysis:**

\- Recent trading volume has been below average, indicating a lack of conviction in the current uptrend.



**d) Support and Resistance:**

\- The stock is approaching a significant resistance level, which could act as a ceiling for further price appreciation.



**Conclusion:**



There are several factors  mentioned above, that suggest McDonald's stock (MCD) could be a potential short candidate:



1. The stock appears overvalued based on traditional valuation metrics.

2. The company faces challenges in revenue growth and margin expansion.

3. High debt levels increase financial risk.

4. Limited growth opportunities in developed markets and challenges in emerging markets.

5. Technical indicators suggest a potential trend reversal and loss of momentum.



However, it's important to note that McDonald's is a well-established company with a strong brand and global presence. Short positions carry inherent risks, and any trading decision should be made in the context of a well-diversified portfolio and with careful consideration of individual risk tolerance.

78,S&P 500 Rebalancing Trade,"The S&P 500 index rebalancing occurs 4x/year with the next one coming up. [SP Global](https://www.spglobal.com/en) announces the additions to the index which will replace companies that have underperformed and will be removed.



S&P rebalancing presents a great opportunity to trade based on predictions of which companies will be added/removed as there is typically a \~5-10% price increase as a result of the rebalance and institutions buying + a positive brand bump.



Although the selection committee has requirements for eligibility which can be found here: [SP 500 Criteria](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/methodologies/methodology-sp-us-indices.pdf), there is a bit of thematic flexibility. By definition the index is ""a market cap-weighted index of US large- and mid-cap stocks."" Typically companies need to be $18B or larger in market cap and historically profitable.



Below is the **SP 500 index sector weighting** (as of Nov 14):

Technology: 33.32% | Financial Services: 13.19% | Consumer Cyclical: 10.80% |. Healthcare: 10.54% | Communication Services: 9.03% | Industrials: 7.58% | Consumer Defensive: 5.56% | Energy: 3.44% | Utilities: 2.54% | Real Estate: 2.17% | Basic Materials: 1.83%



**My target candidates for inclusion:**

\* things like negative trailing EPS, high volatility, recent IPO, etc. may restrict a stock from eligibility

|Ticker|Company|Industry|Sector|Market Cap|P/E|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|

79,BioNTech Analysis and Questions ,"Let me first talk about the BioNTech's Q3 2024 Financial Results and some key intepretations I had:

There are some notable short term challenges, including

   * Decreased revenues from COVID-19 vaccines.
      * For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues were €1.56 billion, down from €2.34 billion in the same period in 2023
   * Net losses due to high R&D spending.
      * The company achieved a net profit of €198.1 million in Q3 2024, compared to €160.6 million in Q3 2023. However, for the first nine months of 2024, BioNTech reported a net loss of €924.8 million, a significant decrease from the €472.4 million net profit in the same period last year.
   * Uncertainties in clinical trial outcomes and regulatory approvals.
      * FDA placed a partial clinical hold on the Phase 3 NSCLC trial due to varying results.
      * The partial FDA clinical hold on BNT316/ONC-392 and the COVID-19-influenza combination vaccine not meeting all primary endpoints are notable challenges.

Now, there are many long term potencials:

* A robust and diverse pipeline with multiple candidates in late-stage trials.
   * Phase 1: 26 drugs currently in this stage; Phase 2: 13 drugs in this phase; Phase 3: 4 drugs in this final stage.
* Strong financial reserves to support ongoing development.
   * BioNTech maintains a strong cash position with €17.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and security investments as of September 30, 2024.
* Strategic shift towards high-growth areas like oncology and personalized medicine.
   * Initiated two Phase 2 trials in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).
   * Planning Phase 3 trials based on Phase 2 outcomes.
   * Presented encouraging data in advanced TNBC, EGFR-mutated NSCLC, and renal cell carcinoma at ESMO 2024.

To raise a question, I have little expertise in biology myself and I deem the company's ability to bring new products to market successfully will be a critical factor in its future performance. Given the inherent risks in drug development and the transition away from COVID-19 vaccine revenues, I want to ask if there are any actual experts on reddit that can provide me with som insights as to how impactful are the company's new drugs as well as the potencial for success. This will heavily influence my decision for investment, thanks in advance.

They have a huge pipeline for oncology, and in VERY difficult cancers such as triple-negative breast cancer - this is the absolute toughest breast cancer type. Having stuff ""in clinical trials"" is FAR from any guarantee.\n\nPhase 1 is just safety testing, to come to a maximum tolerated dose or more often used term now, maximum ***recommended*** dose. Very few patients, maybe a dozen or two.\n\nPhase 2 still has very few patients, but can be up to 60-100, and is in a targeted population. Here we look for efficacy. Is the drug efficacious? i.e. does the drug have anti-tumour activity for oncology trials. Here is where the high barrier to success comes, because EVEN if efficacy is observed, Phase 3 comes next with high barrier.\n\nPhase 3: comparing new drug to standard of care. Standard of care is hard to beat. Because chemotherapy does an immensely amazing job of treating cancer, despite the rough side effects. It is extremely hard to therefore beat the standard of care.\n\n**TLDR:** Very very very few drugs will ever make it through Phase 3 and be FDA approved.', ""Might be a good play but I got burned badly when COVID ended and my position tanked -60%...\n\nSorry but I won't touch this stock anytime soon."", 'BioNTech is developing the only promising Mpox vaccine:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1f1g4xu/comment/lk5bf8j/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1f1g4xu/comment/lk5bf8j/)', '[https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article/20/2/273/4817524#200808417](https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article/20/2/273/4817524#200808417)', 'Thats completly true, but their Pipeline consists of over 30 different drugs.

One thing is that the stats are for all TAs, whereas BioNTech is oncology skewed, and furthermore skewed towards extremely hard to treat subtypes of breast and lung cancer. \n\n  \nAlso looking further, traditionally in the last years we look at the success rate as around 10%. This paper is ""updating"" that statistic to 13%.....

They have only 3 pre-clinical drugs, 26 in phase 1, 14 in phase 2 and 4 in phase 3. Realistically they will get atleast 5 drugs on the market.\n\nLet’s assume an average annual turnover of 2 billion per authorized drug. This is not unlikely in an area in which there are currently no other real drug alternatives. (A blockbuster like Keytruda even generates 25 billion/year). This means that Biontech would generate around 12 billion in sales per year. The net profit margin in 2021/22 was over 54%. Let’s just calculate with 50%. And no, unfortunately that’s not high for cancer drugs. I assume that Biontech will be able to commercialise its cancer therapies with an even higher margin by using its AI acquisitions wisely. Biontech would generate a profit of around 6bn per year. At a peer valuation of 20x earnings, the market capitalisation would be around 120 billion or 500 euros/share.\n\nSo no matter how conservatively you calculate, I think it is virtually impossible to make a loss with Biontech. At the end of the day, investing is always a game of statistics, and here the statistics are really good.', ""Yes either way it’s low… it’s literally splitting hairs. \nWe’re not talking about 90% of oncology drugs for hard subtypes getting approved… The stats paper is literally saying 3% for oncology, and that's not looking at solely the hard-to-treat indications which have a significantly lower success."", 'These are medical statistics lol. “I don’t agree” isn’t a valid scientific argument… you lost credibility in your very first sentence.

I’m not sure if you are familiar  familiar with the biological mechanism of action of keytruda, but it is a once in a lifetime drug. \n\nJust because an indication is hard to treat based on current SOC, doesn’t mean that once a drug is available that it will sell well, for many many reasons include whether its drug like enough, process development, stability, infusion requirements etc. this is why CART companies are going out of business.\n\nSecond of all, you just pulled numbers out of your ass lol.

Then, I would immediately purchase $47,000 in QQQ to avoid wash. 6% is mild correction territory, not a huge collapse, so I’d expect it to go back up soon after purchasing the QQQ and then I’m back to where I started plus $3k in negative capital gains to help my tax situation.

The one caveat is that it's not all positive as it changes your cost basis- In your scenario if it goes back up to 50k and you sell it, you'd be taxed on 3k (50-47k) at time of sale.

82,MCD and SOUN?,"https://careers.mcdonalds.com/director-ai-engineering/job/28631538

McDonald’s is ramping its AI efforts back up and all signs point to SoundHound AI as their next major partner. Their recent job posting for a Director of AI Engineering focuses on integrating Generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs) into existing systems, rather than building proprietary solutions from scratch. This aligns perfectly with SoundHound’s expertise in conversational AI and their dominance in the foodservice sector. Notably, McDonald’s previously ended its AI collaboration with IBM, leaving room for a more specialized partner to enhance its drive-thru, kiosk, and mobile ordering systems.

Adding fuel to the speculation, SoundHound recently announced on their earnings call that they’ve secured a major new client in the restaurant industry—one they are not yet able to name and negotiating with others. Given McDonald’s history of partnering with established tech leaders like Dynamic Yield and the timing of this hiring, it’s hard not to connect the dots. If this is indeed a McDonald’s x SoundHound collaboration, it could mark a transformative leap forward in customer experience with cutting-edge conversational AI.

84,Trump Team Is Seeking to Ease US Rules for Self-Driving Cars,"[https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/11/17/trump-team-said-to-want-to-ease-us-rules-for-self-driving-cars/](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/11/17/trump-team-said-to-want-to-ease-us-rules-for-self-driving-cars/)

  
TSLA +5% overnight due to this news.

  
(Bloomberg) -- Members of President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team have told advisers they plan to make a federal framework for fully self-driving vehicles one of the Transportation Department’s priorities, according to people familiar with the matter.

If new rules enable cars without human controls, that would directly benefit Elon Musk, the Tesla Inc. chief executive officer and Trump mega-donor who has become a powerful fixture in the president-elect’s inner circle. He has bet the future of the EV maker on self-driving technology and artificial intelligence.

Current federal rules pose significant roadblocks for companies looking to deploy vehicles without steering wheels or foot pedals in large quantities, which Tesla plans to do. The Trump team is looking for policy leaders for the department to develop a framework to regulate self-driving vehicles, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly.

While the Transportation Department, through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, can issue rules that would make it easier to run autonomous vehicles, an act of Congress would clear the way for mass adoption of self-driving cars. A bipartisan legislative measure being discussed in early stages would create federal rules around AVs, two of the people said.

One candidate under consideration for Transportation secretary is Emil Michael, a former Uber Technologies Inc. executive who has spoken with Trump’s team and potential staffers, they said. The work is in its early stages and policy details have yet to be determined, they said. 

Republican Representatives Sam Graves of Missouri and Garret Graves of Louisiana have also been considered to lead the department, the people said.

The transition team didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Musk in October announced plans to produce large numbers of driverless Tesla robotaxis that lack driver controls starting in 2026. Current US regulations pose significant hurdles to Musk’s plans for the so-called Cybercab, including a cap limiting their deployment. 

He supported federal rules for autonomy on Tesla’s third-quarter earnings call, saying he’d use any role with the government to push for a process to allow autonomous vehicles to be used nationwide. The pronouncement prompted a selloff of shares of Uber and rival Lyft Inc.

Trump has since named Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency initiative to “dismantle government bureaucracy” and slash spending and regulations deemed overly burdensome.

Past efforts to come up with federal legislation to regulate autonomous vehicles have stumbled.

NHTSA currently permits manufacturers to deploy 2,500 self-driving vehicles per year under a granted exemption, but legislative efforts to increase that number to as many as 100,000 have repeatedly failed.

A bill to do that sailed through the House several years ago during Trump’s first term, but the measure has been bogged down in the Senate. An attempt during the first year of the Biden administration to merge the bill with other legislation faltered when some manufacturers tried to include language that would prevent consumers from suing or forming class-action cases.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gtwjvx/trump_team_is_seeking_to_ease_us_rules_for/,"['Hi, you\'re on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you\'re interested in just politics, see our wiki on [""relevant subreddits""](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

86,My research and direction of ABNB,"Hi Everyone,

Putting a disclaimer here before people come and flame me.

I am from the tech industry with a major in data modelling and have spent the last 15 years of my time trading, investing and sharing my research with my close circle of friends. Some picks bombed rightaway and my friends relying on my research lost a shitton of money, a very small portion were really good wins  but their overall portfolio indeed is still in the green.

So based on their push( and possibly for my validation too), I have decided to post my research here so that the wider community can support the research or find holes in it. Either way, this would help me make it better everytime. Also I trade as well as invest a lot via options, so at any point of time, I might be holding a long or a short position on the stocks I reseach.

I am based out of Melbourne, Australia and use IBKR and TastyTrade for trading in US markets.

I do technical analysis too but to be honest I do not rely on technical indicators much but rather  I rely on my data modeling background to find what the data is telling me. Whether a stock is overvalued, undervalued or worth its current evalation. None of the companies that I pick to trade(go long/short) are a quick trades. Usually my trades bear fruit in 3 to 4 months or sometime much longer. Hence I use the options way. No complex options techniques but just a simple call/put to enter with low capital and stay in longer than I could afford if I had gone the cash way.

I spent a lot of time last week evaluating AirBNB stock and my numbers show that its a short as stock which should keep on declining till the next results in Feb 2025. Then the numbers that come out in Feb 2025 should decide the fate from then onwards. Anything after that would be a speculation.

Based on my  analysis of Airbnb's financial performance, market position, and the industry trend I recommend a short position on ABNB stock. While the company has shown impressive growth and resilience, several factors suggest potential downside risk in the near to medium term.

As with any data modelling, I have also posted the risk of this analysis at the end as to why this modelling could fail and please read this in its entirety before you take any action. And please note, this is not financial advise but just my research based on me looking to take a position on a stock. Feel free to enter a long or short position based on what you infer from the data points below.

As for me, I would be entering a short position when the market opens today(18th Nov).

**Financial and Fundamental Analysis:**

**1. Valuation Concerns:**  
Airbnb's current valuation appears stretched, with a forward P/E ratio of approximately 35x (as of the last reporting date), significantly higher than the industry average. This premium valuation leaves little room for error and may not be sustainable in a challenging macroeconomic environment.

**2. Slowing Growth:**  
While Airbnb has demonstrated strong revenue growth since its IPO, the rate of growth is decelerating. Year-over-year revenue growth has slowed from triple-digit percentages in 2021 to more modest double-digit growth in recent quarters. This trend may continue as the company faces tougher year-over-year comparisons and market saturation in key regions.

**3. Regulatory Headwinds:**  
Airbnb continues to face regulatory challenges in various markets worldwide. Cities like New York, Barcelona, and Amsterdam have implemented stricter regulations on short-term rentals, which could impact Airbnb's inventory and revenue potential in these key markets.

**4. Increasing Competition:**  
The short-term rental market is becoming increasingly competitive, with traditional hotel chains expanding their offerings and new entrants like Vrbo (Expedia Group) gaining market share. This intensifying competition may pressure Airbnb's margins and market position.

**5. Macroeconomic Uncertainties:**  
The travel industry is sensitive to economic conditions. With concerns about inflation, potential recession, and geopolitical tensions, consumer discretionary spending on travel may decrease, negatively impacting Airbnb's bookings and revenue.

**6. Profitability Concerns:**  
While Airbnb has recently achieved profitability, its margins remain thin. The company's efforts to expand into new markets and services may put pressure on profitability in the short to medium term.

**Technical Analysis:**

**1. Bearish Trend:**  
The stock has been in a downtrend since its peak in February 2021, forming lower highs and lower lows. This suggests persistent selling pressure and a lack of sustained bullish momentum.

**2. Moving Average Crossover:**  
The 50-day moving average has recently crossed below the 200-day moving average, forming a ""death cross."" This bearish signal often precedes further downside in the stock price.

**3. Resistance Levels:**  
ABNB stock has consistently failed to break through key resistance levels, indicating strong selling pressure at higher prices.

**4. Relative Strength Index (RSI):**  
The RSI has been trending downward and has struggled to break above the 60 level in recent months, suggesting weakness in buying momentum.

**5. Volume Analysis:**  
Recent rallies have occurred on relatively low volume, while sell-offs have seen higher volume. This pattern suggests that selling pressure remains dominant.

**Risks to Short Thesis:**

**1. Innovation and New Revenue Streams:**  
Airbnb's continued focus on product innovation and expansion into new services could drive unexpected growth and improve investor sentiment.

**2. Travel Industry Recovery:**  
A stronger-than-expected rebound in global travel could boost Airbnb's bookings and revenue, potentially leading to positive earnings surprises.

**3. Margin Improvement:**  
If Airbnb can significantly improve its operating margins through cost-cutting measures or increased efficiency, it could lead to better-than-expected profitability.

**Conclusion:**  
While Airbnb remains a leader in the short-term rental market with a strong brand and global presence, the combination of stretched valuation, slowing growth, regulatory challenges, and bearish technical indicators suggests potential downside risk. I would be initiating a short position in ABNB stock using either a March or April 2025 PUT option, with close monitoring of the identified risks to the short thesis.

Then my next layer filters based on growth and profitablity(and by profitablitiy I mean are margins increasing or declining). Usually I have seen companies ignoring margins and scaling up the business only to realize that a negative margin scaling up means that you are now doing losses at scale. Not a good position to be in. My this filter also breaks down revenue by source. The next filter is for that industry and geographies where that stock operates in considering factors like market saturation and margin pressure from other players in that industry and geography. Then the next layer applies technical analysis and price action to the stocks which reached this filter.

I have listed a few below that I found when I was conducting my research before initiating the short.\n\n1. High Operational Costs -  Significant investments in technology, including platform development, cybersecurity, and machine learning, to maintain and enhance user experience. Airbnb spends heavily on global marketing campaigns to acquire new hosts and guests and retain existing ones.Costs associated with providing round-the-clock customer service, including dispute resolution between guests and hosts.\n\n2. Revenue Model - Airbnb takes a commission from bookings (usually around 3% from hosts and 14% from guests). While this model scales with more bookings, it limits their margin because the commission percentage isn't exceedingly high compared to the overall booking value.\n\n3. Regulatory and Legal Costs - Compliance Expenses: Airbnb must navigate a complex web of local regulations around short-term rentals, which often involve lobbying and legal challenges.Fines and Settlements: Penalties and fines in regions where they face legal hurdles also eat into profits.\n\n4. Host and Guest Incentives - Airbnb invests in loyalty programs, host guarantees, and guest protections to enhance trust and usability on the platform. These incentives add to operating costs.\n\n5. Competition - With competitors like Vrbo (owned by Expedia), [Booking.com](http://Booking.com), and traditional hotel chains, Airbnb must keep its pricing competitive, limiting how much they can charge in fees or increase prices.\n\n6. Market Volatility - Travel demand can fluctuate due to external factors like economic downturns, pandemics, or geopolitical issues, impacting revenue predictability.\n\n7. Scaling Challenges - While Airbnb has global reach, scaling introduces complexities, including currency fluctuations, local market adaptation, and increased staffing needs.\n\n8. Post-IPO Investments - Since its IPO in late 2020, Airbnb has been reinvesting heavily in growth initiatives, including experiences, longer-term stays, and market expansion, rather than focusing solely on profitability."", ""Totally get it.

88,"New Nvidia AI chips overheating in servers, the Information reports","Nov 17 (Reuters) - Nvidia's new Blackwell AI Chips, which have already faced delays, have encountered problems with accompanying servers that overheat, causing some customers to worry they will not have enough time to get new data centers up and running, the Information reported on Sunday.The Blackwell graphics processing units overheat when connected together in server racks designed to hold up to 72 chips, the report said, citing sources familiar with the issue.

  
The chipmaker has asked its suppliers to change the design of the racks several times to resolve overheating problems, according to Nvidia employees who have been working on the issue, as well as customers and suppliers with knowledge of the issue, the report said without naming the suppliers.""Nvidia is working with leading cloud service providers as an integral part of our engineering team and process. The engineering iterations are normal and expected,"" a company spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters.

89,Is PLTR in bubble territory?,"I don’t own any so this question just stems from curiosity. 

Its market cap was ~$15bn two years ago and is $150bn today. There’s nothing inherently concerning about that (NVDA was similar, as we all know), but its P/E ratio is 329 - is the rise unsustainable?

I understand Palantir has a lot of positive momentum from AI hype, expected defense spending under Trump, and general recovery of growth stocks as interest rates fall from their highs. These are all valid reasons to expect continued success from Palantir, but are investors irrationally exuberant?

90,Chris Wright - CEO of Liberty Energy and board member of Oklo Inc. tapped to be US Energy Secretary,"[Link to the article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-names-fossil-fuel-executive-213214952.html)

>  
WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect [Donald Trump](https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump) has selected Chris Wright, a campaign donor and fossil fuel executive, to serve as energy secretary in his upcoming, second administration.

>CEO of Denver-based Liberty Energy, Wright is a vocal advocate of [oil and gas development](https://apnews.com/hub/oil-and-gas-industry), including fracking, a key pillar of Trump’s quest to achieve U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market.

>Wright has been one of the industry’s loudest voices against efforts to fight climate change and could give fossil fuels a boost, including quick action to end [a year-long pause on natural gas export approvals](https://apnews.com/article/lng-exports-biden-europe-climate-russia-3c2bfd853c0d53531a677b142b009dbc) by the Biden administration.

>Wright also has criticized what he calls a “top-down” approach to climate by liberal and left-wing groups and said the climate movement around the world is “collapsing under its own weight.” Wright, who has never served in government, has written that more fossil fuel production is needed around the globe to lift people out of poverty.

>Consideration of Wright to head the administration's energy department won support from influential conservatives, including oil and gas tycoon Harold Hamm.

>Hamm, executive chairman of Oklahoma-based Continental Resources, a major shale oil company, is a longtime Trump supporter and adviser who played a key role on energy issues in Trump’s first term. Hamm helped organize an event at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in April where Trump reportedly asked industry leaders and lobbyists to [donate $1 billion to Trump’s campaign](https://apnews.com/article/schumer-democrats-big-oil-price-fixing-collusion-07a8583a2b12e645d2860608c626cc7c), with the expectation that Trump would curtail environmental regulations if reelected.

>Mike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's top lobbying group, said Wright’s experience in the energy sector “gives him an important perspective that will inform his leadership"" of the Energy Department.

>“We look forward to working with him once confirmed to bolster American geopolitical strength by lifting DOE’s pause on LNG export permits and ensuring the open access of American energy for our allies around the world,"" Sommers said.

>Jackie Wong, senior vice president for climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, called Wright “a champion of dirty fossil fuels"" and said his nomination to lead the Energy Department was “a disastrous mistake.”

>“The Energy Department should be doing all it can to develop and expand the energy sources of the 21st century, not trying to promote the dirty fuels of the last century,"" Wong said. “Given the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE’s core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever.""

Additionally, given Wrights positions at Liberty and Oklo, will the market react positively or negatively towrds those two companies in particular?

94,Lets talk pharma stocks,"If your not aware the entire sector has been selling off on the appointment of RFK jr for secretary of Health and Human services. Although he was nominated he still has to get approved by the senate, and the senate has big pharma supporting them. So whether he actually gets the position is to be determined.

Second if he does take the position its not going to stop or delay any current R&D, if anything it may speed up the approval process making it more efficient with less bureaucracy. People need to understand drugs and vaccines are a global business not just the US. Europe, South America and Asia have their own FDA and approve US drugs and vaccines.

Third, what matters more is who the president elect appoints for FDA commissioner. Much like the SEC has a head the FDA does too. RFK will focus on fruit loops and the FDA will focus on pharma and their business because, he doesn't have a medical degree and will quickly realize he's out of his element.

The whole sector is way oversold due to fear. Same fear that tariffs will destroy the economy.

I have $PFE leaps for $25 because this stock is way too cheap for what the business is worth. You also get a 6% yield with PFE. Their GPL pill is on the horizon(they are working on the right dosage) and their cancer business(Seagen) is worth more than their current market cap.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gsqisf/lets_talk_pharma_stocks/,"['For those of you who were still suckling in 2016-2020,\n\nTrumps tweets > Any market analysis.\n\nLogic will be in abeyance the next 4 years', 'Do not agree with point #2 at all.  \n\nThat being said, agree with PFE being undervalued.', ""The way I see it is why bother playing in a sector that is not going to be popular, not going to be getting fund to flows and is likely to be in the doghouse. I mean you might not lose much money on this and you might even make a little bit but is the opportunity cost really worth it? Like the chance of Pfizer going to 40 in the next 4 years, doesn't really seem very high, it would take some black swan event or white swan event I guess we could call it to make that happen. We only have so much money, is this really the best place to put it?"", 'I bought some ABBV on Friday, I was going to buy it when it dropped 12% earlier but getting it for $165s was too good to pass up.\nI am underwater on my 2000 shares of PFE but am toying with buying more.  Being paid 6% to wait is tempting.', 'Bought Biontech on Friday. With their immense cash position and promising Portfolio it was already cheaply valued before. But the recent drop was unjustified, because if the Trump administration sabotages Pfizer or Moderna, its rather bullish for european Pharma-Stocks.', ""Big Pharma is big enough to either.\n1. Pay off Trump.\n2. Take RFK out (to dinner) and not see consequences.\n\nI have no doubt that they won't let anything stand in their way."", ""RFK is anti vaccine. I don't think he will go far enough to ban them, but will succeed in making them not mandatory. Vaccine rates will drop, outbreaks will start and spread like wildfire cause the diseases they prevent are highly contagious. That's the time to invest in Pharma (revenues lowest). They will make a rebound cause people will realize vaccines work."", 'One important point - Trump can make a [Recess Appointment](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S2-C3-1/ALDE_00001144/) \\- good for two years without Senate approval.\n\nSecondly, I am expecting some significant departures at the FDA that will stymie drug and device approval.   \n\nOn PFE \xa0I always viewed PFE as an acquirer of technology, not innovative. Some of the acquisition were integrated well, other poorly. I suspect their Seagen acquisition is underperforming (it still may be too early to tell) and they are also playing catch-up on the GLP craze.\n\nWith the latest news, I expect a mass exit of personnel from some of FDA units that will slow the approval processes and other than vaccines, I see any new GLP-1 approvals will have an uphill battle.\n\nI personally am staying away until I see a more positive trend / news.\n\nIf I was going to invest, I would look at companies with a ""moat\' in the medical device area or so big they have few competitors,  like  RMD or GEHC.', 'Idk about timing, it could definitely sink pharma and especially vaccine stocks like MRNA for a long time, but definitely agree this will likely create a good buying opportunity eventually.', ""I'm buying the dip."", 'Im watching closely, If he doesn’t get approved load the boat on otm LLY calls and retire.', ""The real risk being priced in is that RFK removes the necessary battery of vaccines to go to school. The fact is most people won't get these vaccines unless they're forced to. For companies like PFE, that could tank 30% of their revenue."", ""As someone whos in LS consulting and finance, look up US vs. ex-US revenue.\n\n\nHell, a lot of vaccines marketed in the US don't even get market access in the EU, especially EU5, because their single payers have far greater requirements from a health and technology assessment, e.g., transformational delta for efficacy or a direct comparator trial.\n\n\nR&D is also paused, delayed, or licensed out all the time from regular pipeline optimizations. Not going to say this will necessarily happen fro. RFK news, but changes in FDA policy, public sentiment, or legislature absolutely get factored in when comparing commercial potential across competing pipeline assets and deciding on portfolio and BD&L strategy."", ""It's definitely bad, because vaccines are bought with government funds. Also trump likely doesn't have the ties to pharma that Biden's camp has. Would probably stay on the lookout and see if they develop relationships with any of the pharma companies, and then buy in."", ""The Pharma industry will find a way.  They are a massive industry that has ties into governments all over the world.  \n\n  \nThe biggest concern about RFK Jr as head of the FDA is that his push for deregulation leads to a large increase in unsafe products, including medications.  We know that Trump offered oil executives deregulation at $1B per instance.  That's going to be the case for other industries too.  At some point, the deregulations will lead to enough unsafe products that boycotts begin.  But, that will take years to happen.\n\n  \nRegarding PFE, always be cautious with them.  For the most part, they are a terrible Pharmaceutical company.  They are a very good Pharmaceutical sales company, though.  Typically, the only way they get market leading drugs is through Mergers & Acquisitions, which is a very costly way to do R&D.  But, they usually do get a really strong CFO to keep their shareholders happy."", 'Choose carefully, but if you got cash and you’re playing the long game, this is absolutely a huge opportunity.\n\nRFK is legitimately insane and, even if he is able to enact FDA policy change, it will all be instantly reversed the minute Trump leaves office. At that point, all the projects pharma has shelved instantly come back on the board and there will be years of higher than normal drug approvals.\n\nIf Trump stays the course and installs RFK atop the FDA, then I don’t think we’re even close to the bottom. Even so, many stocks are 100% at a discount today.', 'I’m keeping my Novo Nordisk stock. There will be insulin and weight loss medications needed in years to come', 'Psychopharma (shroom stocks) have been raging.

These old biotech companies are used to fronting a ton of up front cost for R&D, then making up for it by charging a lot for medication once it’s approved. Then they use those excess funds to help develop new drugs - or buy out companies that have developed new drugs. \xa0\n\nthese alternate drug companies completely disrupt that cash flow and business model, which unfortunately means it likely reduces their ability to develop and test new drugs.\xa0\xa0\n\n\xa0I don’t think the politics of it matter that much - unless the politicians find ways to ban these companies that are selling to consumers at lower rates. Unfortunately the medical industry is super bloated in the US, is unaffordable to most consumers (whose employers pay ~2k a month for health insurance that is basically useless) - so the government can’t just stop these folks from getting medication that they need. I’m a huge fan of these biomed super powers losing market share because that’s one component to actually re-build our healthcare issues in the US. We need a market disruption since obviously the political attempts to fix healthcare have not actually done much historically and usually just contribute to more bloat.\xa0\n\nEdit: another dynamic that may come into play long tern is that RFK talks a lot about health. He seems to actually want people to eat healthier, and several comments from JD Vance on podcasts align with that. If they are\xa0able to push forward policy that actually gets people to eat and act healthier again - then the medical industry will struggle. Our medical industry is reliant on kids eating Doritos, drinking Mountain Dew, and pretending that pizza is a vegetable. And their parents microwaving frozen lasagna in plastic containers for dinner, after having McDonald’s for lunch.

Pharma R&D spending *has* doubled in the last 10 years (at least as measured by the ratio of R&D / net revenue). I didn’t know that. That’s good to see. \n\nThough, a lot of that is incremental nonsense that increases their revenue slightly but doesn’t result in new drug approvals, which are the true money maker and the only way pharma companies benefit society. I thought this quote was interesting from this website:\n\n[https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57126](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57126)\n\n“By contrast, a greater portion of the R&D spending of larger drug companies (including those in PhRMA) is devoted to conducting clinical trials, developing incremental “line extension” improvements (such as new dosages or delivery systems, or new combinations of two or more existing drugs), and conducting postapproval testing for safety-monitoring or marketing purposes.“', 'I know, 3/4s of my holdings are inside one of my two IRAs.  It is my taxable account that I hardly ever change due to tax consequences.', 'lol', 'Bench science is conducted for decades. The knowledge required to understand something like a potential cancer treatment is profound. Applied science is well established in academia and scientists and physician scientists are well abreast of their fields and are well able to design trials. Trials do not require 100s of millions of dollars. They do require time and effort. They do need to be promising, either cheaper or more effective than existing drugs. But if they show promise the barrier to approving a trial is much less than ""100s of millions of dollars.""\n\nDrugs either prove themselves as safe effective and useful or they do not. Drugs that are not safe effective or useful fall through trials. If results are mixed, the trials are redesigned. Drugs can even get approval based on mixed data, because data analysis is not ""all or nothing"". \n\nThere are no hidden incredible drugs that would be useful that are not in use. If they were, we would use them. \n\nI\'m a doctor and I have conducted clinical research.', 'RFK is definitely not going to improve anything.', "">Of net revenue. As in, revenue minus all other departments’ budgets\n\nThat's just wrong.\n\n>\xa0incremental “line extension” improvements\n\nWhich most certainly is a benefit."", "">Applied science is well established in academia and scientists and physician scientists are well abreast of their fields and are well able to design trials.\n\nI respectfully disagree here. Applied science is good in some areas but is especially poor in other  less understood but highly needed areas, such as the neurosciences. Doctors learned more about AD from the commercial failure of Aduhelm than they ever learned about AD in a lab, specifically, the efficacy being time and dose dependent, which researchers did not know until aducanumab went for approval despite studying AD for many decades.\n\nAduhelm was a drug that was approved on mixed data yet resulted in very decorated doctors resigning from the FDA because they didn't agree with the premise on approving the drug with spliced data. This controversy ultimately led to the drug being shelved despite helping patients and demonstrating clinical benefits.\n\nI would argue the rigorousness of FDA standards has held back AD and PD research for at least the last 20 years - and those diseases have large patient populations and are devastating."", 'I’m not saying he is. OP asked for an example of corruption and I’m explaining the nuances of the industry as an insider.\n\n“Price gouging” is a convenient boogie man but the reason for high prices is much deeper. The barrier to entry is so high that taking on risk isn’t economical.\n\nThe real corruption is at the intersection of patent law, regulators, hedge funds, big pharma, and insurance companies.\n\nIt’s a very complicated puzzle.', 'Wrong as far as what net revenue means or the R&D budget / net revenue is 20%-30%?\n\nI’m a researcher in the pharma industry but I’m not a financial professional. I might be misunderstanding, but it looks like it’s all in the link. It’s very comprehensive.\n\n“In recent years, the pharmaceutical industry’s R&D spending as a share of net revenues (sales less expenses and rebates) has increased: Consumer spending on brand-name prescription drugs has risen, but R&D spending has risen more quickly. In the early 2000s, when drug industry revenues were rising sharply, the industry’s R&D intensity—that is, its R&D spending as a share of net revenues—averaged about 13 percent each year. Over the decade from 2005 to 2014, the industry’s R&D intensity averaged 18 percent to 20 percent each year. That ratio has been trending upward since 2012, and it exceeded 25 percent in 2018 and 2019, the highest R&D intensities recorded by the pharmaceutical industry as a whole since at least 2000. Data are limited for earlier years, but among PhRMA member companies, annual R&D intensities averaged 18 percent from 1980 through 2010 and never exceeded 22 percent.4 Since then, R&D intensity has increased among PhRMA firms just as it has for the industry as a whole, reaching 25 percent in 2017 before decreasing slightly in 2018.”', ""The data and approval were controversial. It felt like a drug being pushed to market because the market wanted something, not because the drug was useful. \n\nNeuroscience itself is challenging. You're talking an extraordinarily complex and delicate system with highly unproven interventions. \n\nAs far as this example, you're arguing that the FDA is both too rigorous but also too lax? \n\nLack of rigor will lead to unproven and potentially dangerous interventions hitting the market. Rigor keeps people safe. Safety should be prioritized, given the potential for harm. That's why the first step in clinical trials is proving safety, not proving efficacy.""]"
95,What on earth is happening with ICON PLC?,"I Cannot find an article anywhere. I have followed ICON PLC since their acquisition of PRA Health Sciences in 2021. They've done extremely well since then and are an anticipated speaker and the London Health Conference coming up soon. 

Their stock has crashed 37% in 30 days despite a P/E ratio of 24x while the rest of the market is averaging 17x. 

Are they overvalued or does the market see something in them?",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gskv4q/what_on_earth_is_happening_with_icon_plc/,"['That last quarter was not very good and there have been concerns about CRO activity. You also have a market that increasingly seems to have a ""buyer\'s strike"" for anything not working - I\'ve felt like that in the last couple of years but lately it seems even worse for some things. It *eventually* creates good opportunities for people with a longer-term view.\n\n I think people see something like that down 10% and traditionally would think buying opportunity, but lately it feels like this sort of situation keeps eroding until RSIs get into the teens (this is at 17) which is very technically oversold.  The pile on for what\'s working seems faster and more aggressive in the last few years than it\'s ever been and the pile *out* for what\'s not working seems more aggressive than I can recall. \n\nWill the business rebound imminently? Probably not; maybe sometime more middle of next year (from commentary from the last quarter\'s earnings PR: ""This win, coupled with other recently executed\npartnerships, supports our outlook for growth **over the medium term**.”) In terms of the stock, short-term could get even more oversold, but an RSI in the teens is pretty substantially technically oversold. \n\nIn terms of the last quarter, the first sentence of the commentary from the PR is a pretty good summary: “ICON’s results for the third quarter did not meet the expectations we had previously provided\ndue to specific customer and division-level impacts. Our revenue shortfall was attributable to **more material headwinds from two\nlarge customers undergoing budget cuts and changes in their development model**, lower than anticipated vaccine-related activity,\nand **ongoing cautiousness from biotech customers resulting in award and study delays.**""\n\nThey also took FY guidance down pretty substantially last quarter.\n\nSo, should the stock have sold off after those results? Yes, absolutely - they weren\'t good. I just feel like with these situations though there\'s increasingly more of a ""blip"" then a bounce  - you saw about a 20% decline after those earnings, a slight/quick bounce (4-5%?) and then another 20% down.', 'I’m a doctor that used to be a principal investigator on clinical trials. \n\nof all the “full service” CROs (full service generally meaning the big 4 - Covance, IQVIA, ICON and PPD) ICON was an absolute shit show. Their safety lab reports were the worst id ever seen. Nurses would complain about their kits (box of “tools” to collect the required bio specimen samples to perform trial-specific lab tests, from the trial participants) all the time.', ""Looks there was some bad news in their last earnings last month; didn't meet expectations. Big layoffs around that time too. Baird downgrade.\n\nHonestly,  PE of 24 does sound kinda high for a company like this. I mean, it's not like its Eli Lilly."", ""I used to work there. \n\nDon't invest in them. They are a bad company withsl shady practices."", 'A PE of 24 after a bad quarter is still too high.  If revenues are dropping, it should be closer 15.  Also, CROs rely on their future work.  Read the call script.  If contracts are down, they’re fubar for years to come.', ""With RFKs anti vaccine perogative, this company really doesn't look good right now. Sorry OP"", ""My concern is mostly with how quickly they are losing value in their stock.\n\nI just do not get how a company with a P/E ratio that high could have such a dramatically tumbling stock simply due to missing their earnings target for 1 quarter. Seems like a huge market overreaction, unless there is something we don't know.\n\nDespite being oversold, I cannot find any reason for it to stabilize. I hesitate to jump in cause I feel this could keep tumbling down\n\nI know a decent amount about the science, but I know little about trading. I am trying to find balance among the two, lol."", '> My concern is mostly with how quickly they are losing value in their stock.\n\nSimilar drawdown in 2021-2022, although that was over several months, not three. Nothing more than mere opinion (and may not be popular opinion), but it just feels like that\'s the way the market increasingly is - if something isn\'t working, it just feels like it\'s sold in that fashion. It deserved to be sold after that quarter, but the nature of how some things are sold in the last few years feels different; you get a dump, blip up (and no guarantee of that), then it just keeps on selling as if it\'s a buyer\'s strike.\n\nElsewhere in health care, REGN another instance of bad news and selling that is reasonable to a point and then starts to seem almost indiscriminate. I get that people believe solar will struggle under the new administration, but a stock like ENPH down 30% YTD into the election goes down another 33% in the 10 days after? There were a number of names up 30-40-50-70% after the election - at some point that\'s indiscriminate, ""just get me in at any price because line go up"" buying. \n\nAgain, nothing more than mere opinion, but the market at both extremes feels different than it used to 5 years ago. What works is bought to the point of starting to seem indiscriminate and goes from 0 to overextended/""pile on"" in a hurry and what doesn\'t is sold to the point of eventually starting to seem indiscriminate and like a buyer\'s strike. The former creates some good opportunities to eventually sell and the latter eventually creates very good buyiing opportunities for those with at least a medium term view.\n\nDo I know where the bottom is for ICLR? No idea, but I think when you get these names with RSIs in the teens (technically oversold to the point of being near-obliterated), it\'s time to at least start a position and average down if you have a medium term view. \n\nPersonally, I\'ve found a lot more of interest in the ""what\'s not"" category in recent weeks than in the ""what\'s hot"" category after spending years focused almost entirely on the latter. Stuff like LVMH down 40% in pretty much a straight line because it\'s facing some headwinds on top of the worst underperformance by European markets vs the US in 20 years. Do I know that\'s the bottom? Nope, but think very highly of management, got to a level where I\'m very comfortable owning it with a medium-term view and at least decent start so far as it held up while a lot else didn\'t over the last couple days.']"

97,BKNG and negative shareholder equity.,"Ive been searching for a new stock to buy recently and was considering an online travel stock like BKNG or TCOM. A little wary of TCOM as its China based. BKNG income statement doesnt look bad but i was looking through BKNG's balance sheet and realised they somehow have an enormous amount of debt and negative shareholder equity. Which seems to be getting worse even with covid long over.

This seems like a significant milestone for a stock that has been beaten down since it's failure with Barstool during the meme-stock craze.

You can see my other posts for a more in-depth thesis, but some recent news worth mentioning plus a conspiracy theory:

* Stock is up 30% in the past 6 months, yet \~15% short interest of float. 
* Q3 EPS beat, Rev didn't. Lower promo expenses. Lower losses in OSB than expected. Market share not where we want, but path to profitability is improving.
* Former Disney CTO joined the company. As a reminder, Disney owns ESPN so I see this as more buy-in from the Disney team. 
* Greenlight Capital increased their stake, it is now their 6th largest holding. Einhorn said ""we believe the market ascribes a substantial negative value to \[their OSB business\]"". And thinks OSB could add $20 per share of value.
* ESPN --- ESPN Bet account linking allows the app to know your favorite sports and fantasy team so it can create personalized bets/marketing for users. Shows further integration with Disney.
* Finally launched in NYC, mixed results for now. 
* Multiple analysts initiate coverage, showing it is a player worth tracking. Mixed opinions.

One big deal that no one talks about here is that Disney currently has $500M in warrants to purchase PENN stock. If I remember correctly, their agreement was for 3 years; if Disney doesn't like ESPN Bet's performance then they can pull the plug. Well we just crossed Year 1 and Disney's CTO has now joined PENN, they're linking ESPN accounts, they're seeing fewer losses than expected, and by 2026 (year 3) PENN believes they will have ""meaningful free cash flow"" from OSB. I have a very hard time believing that Disney would rather go through the headache of ripping out all of their integrations with PENN to find a new provider. Like the sunk cost there would be massive and why would they? The just want a faceless tech/casino provider so that they can put their own brand as the name. Fanduel/DraftKings/MGM, all of those would want their own names on the app. 

Additionally, and maybe this really gets to the tinfoil hat (I don't think it's as crazy as you might), why wouldn't Disney acquire more PENN stock? It's one of the cheapest casino operators out there right now, sports betting is becoming more mainstream (and palatable for DIS investors), and they get more upside if this thing takes off? The market for OSB continues to grow as more states legalize it and they have a massive opportunity to gain market share. Why wouldn't they want more of that upside?

Look, I've been DCA-ing into PENN over the past year, so do I want this to be right? Absolutely. But there just seem to be way too many tailwinds popping up for this valuation to make any sense with even a remotely successful ESPN Bet. DraftKings has been significantly more unprofitable ever since launching their app in 2018 and trades at 5.0x their Rev, but when PENN is negative it trades at 0.5x (other valuation methods show similar)?

99,Does everyone suffer from the same FOMO?,"Hi all. Quick question: I have started stock picking for 1.5 years now, and man do I often think back and wish I just stayed in longer, or exited earlier, etc etc etc

Overall performance is roughly in line with S&P. And I am learning to keep my calm, to form my hypotheses, and to stick to my process.

It’s why gaining $X on a stock doesn’t feel as good as losing that same amount feels bad (if that makes sense).
