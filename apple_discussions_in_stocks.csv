How are you thinking about your portfolio given the outcome of the 2024 US Election?,"As the new Trump administration takes office in 2025, we will all grapple with a rapidly evolving economic landscape. The anticipated policies promise significant shifts reminiscent of Hungary's economic transformation.   Please let me know if you agree or disagree with any of the picks below...

# Understanding the Policy Shifts

**1. Economic Nationalism and Protectionism**

The administration's ""America First"" agenda is expected to:

* **Increase Tariffs on Imports**: Tariffs could rise by 10-25%, mainly targeting Chinese goods. This move aims to protect domestic industries but may lead to higher consumer prices.
* **Promote Onshoring**: Incentives for companies to relocate manufacturing to the U.S. could include tax breaks and subsidies.

**Impact Analysis:**

* **Beneficiaries**: Domestic manufacturers like **Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT)** and **3M Company (NYSE: MMM)** could see increased demand due to reduced competition from imports.
* **Potential Losers**: Companies reliant on imported materials or global supply chains like **Apple** may face higher production costs and supply-chain disruptions.

**2. Deregulation and Tax Cuts**

Anticipated measures include:

* **Corporate Tax Reductions**: Lowering the rate from 21% to 15% could significantly boost net earnings.
* **Deregulation Efforts**: Especially in energy and finance, rolling back regulations like Dodd-Frank could reshape industry operations.

**Impact Analysis:**

* **Financial Sector Gains**: Banks like **JPMorgan Chase** and **Goldman Sachs** might experience increased profitability due to relaxed lending regulations and lower taxes.
* **Energy Sector Surge**: Traditional oil and gas companies like **Exxon Mobil Corporation** and **Chevron Corporation** could benefit from reduced environmental regulations and expanded drilling rights.

**3. Increased Government Intervention**

Potential actions:

* **Sector-Specific Policies**: Favoring industries aligned with national priorities, possibly leading to subsidies for sectors like defense and infrastructure.
* **Unpredictable Regulatory Changes**: Sudden policy shifts could affect long-term planning and investment.

**Impact Analysis:**

* **Defense Contractors Advantage**: Companies like **Lockheed Martin** and **Northrop Grumman** may secure lucrative government contracts amid increased defense spending.
* **Risk of Cronyism**: Firms with close ties to the administration could outperform, while others may struggle to compete.

# What Lessons Can We Learn from Hungary Under Viktor Orbán

* **Nationalization and Heavy Taxation**: Foreign companies faced significant taxes, reducing foreign investment.
* **Favoritism Towards Domestic Firms**: Companies aligned with government objectives received advantages, distorting competition.
* **Market Volatility**: Unpredictable policies led to investor uncertainty and capital flight.

**Application to the U.S. Context:**

* **Regulatory Risk**: Investors should be wary of sudden policy changes that could impact sectors like technology and healthcare.
* **Importance of Government Relations**: Companies investing in government lobbying and aligning with national priorities may fare better.

# Sector-Specific Investment Opportunities and Risks

**1. Sectors Poised for Growth**

* **Energy Sector**
   * *Analysis*: With deregulation and a focus on energy independence, traditional energy companies will likely expand operations.
   * *Investment Picks*: Consider **Halliburton** for oilfield services and **Phillips 66** for refining and midstream operations.
   * *Commodities Impact*: Expect a potential rise in crude oil prices due to increased domestic demand, making investments in oil futures or ETFs like the **United States Oil Fund LP (NYSEARCA: USO)** attractive.
* **Financial Services**
   * *Analysis*: Deregulation could lead to increased lending and investment banking activities.
   * *Investment Picks*: Regional banks like **(NYSE: PNC)** may benefit from economic growth and deregulation.
* **Defense and Infrastructure**
   * *Analysis*: Increased government spending in defense and infrastructure projects.
   * *Investment Picks*: Infrastructure companies like **(NYSE: VMC)** and **Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM)** could see increased demand for construction materials.

**2. Sectors Facing Headwinds**

* **Healthcare and Pharmaceuticals**
   * *Analysis*: Potential reforms aiming to reduce drug prices could squeeze profit margins.
   * *Investment Risks*: Companies like **Pfizer** and **Merck** may face pricing pressures.
   * *Considerations*: Biotech firms focusing on innovative treatments may be less impacted.
* **Renewable Energy**
   * *Analysis*: A shift away from climate initiatives could reduce subsidies and support for renewable energy projects.
   * *Investment Risks*: Companies like **First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ: FSLR)** and **NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NEE)** might experience slowed growth.
   * *Commodities Impact*: Potential decrease in demand for renewable energy commodities like lithium and rare earth elements.
* **Technology and Multinationals**
   * *Analysis*: Tariffs and trade barriers could disrupt global supply chains.
   * *Investment Risks*: Tech giants like **Microsoft** and **Alphabet** might face international market challenges.

# Navigating Market Volatility

**Strategies to Mitigate Risks:**

* **Defensive Stocks**: Consider utilities and consumer staples companies like **The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE: PG)** and **Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE: DUK)**, which tend to be more stable during market fluctuations.
* **Gold and Precious Metals**: Historically seen as a haven, investing in gold through **SPDR Gold Shares (NYSEARCA: GLD)** or mining companies like **Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE: GOLD)** can hedge against volatility.

# Exploring International Investment Opportunities

**Emerging Markets Resilience:**

* **India**
   * *Analysis*: With a domestic solid growth trajectory, India is less exposed to U.S. policy changes.
   * *Investment Picks*: **HDFC Bank Limited (NYSE: HDB)** offers exposure to India's growing middle class.
* **Taiwan and South Korea**
   * *Analysis*: Key semiconductor and AI supply chain players are potentially insulated from U.S.-China trade tensions.
   * *Investment Picks*: **Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd**.

**Other Potential Diversification Plays:**

* **International ETFs**: Investing in funds like **iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSEARCA: EEM)** provides broad exposure to emerging markets.
* **Commodities**: Diversifying with commodities like copper and nickel, essential for global infrastructure and technology, can capitalize on international demand.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gyxypj/how_are_you_thinking_about_your_portfolio_given/,0,"Thanks I also have Chat GPT; Cannot predict, and neither can anyone else. 

Been buying steadily since 1976 and will continue. ; Don't try to time the market.


I just continue to buy ; Yawn. Nothing changes.; I appreciate that you put together this post to prompt discussion, but sadly /r/investing has just become /r/Bogleheads v2. Not that Boglehead advice is bad or wrong, I just wish there was a bit more nuanced discussion here.; Lots of text only to be downvoted into oblivion… ooofff….; Continue buying; Political markets are short legged. Just keep averaging in.; I predict new all time highs for things like for-profit prisons, pay-day loans, liquor, gambling, dollar stores, etc.; He who buys the most stocks is buried in the largest stocking; ""Don't try to time the market"" is solid advice, and I agree with that generally. But what I'm talking about here isn't timing short-term market fluctuations. It's about strategically positioning for the long term based on significant policy shifts. Adjusting investments in response to anticipated changes from the new administration isn't market timing—it's long-term investing.; But Bogleheads are necessary so others may profit :-); I am... but the question is... buying what...   To simplify the question: what do you think about the long-term view of these: CAT, MMM, JPM, GS, Exxon, Chevron, Northrop, Lockheed, PNC, VMC, MLM, PG, DUK, GLD, GOLD, HDB, Samsung, EFA

over these: AAPL, Pfizer, Merck, FSLR, NEE, MSFT, Google

given the new administration...; This comment, but especially your original post reek of chatgpt; Just continue investing and diversifying in an S&P500 or Total Stock Market Index Fund, and/or small/mid/large cap growth and value, international, and some bond funds. 

If you’re concerned about the next administration, why would you gamble by buying individual stocks?

Additionally, the premise of your original post is based on the next 4-years, while this question is asking opinions on the long-term prospects of specific stocks based on the next 4-years, which is impossible to predict, and provides even more reason to just continue buying low cost index funds.; Index funds, which outpace most retail investors who stock pick.


You can't time the market.; Maybe I spend too much time with robots, but I assure you that I am primarily human... my wife may disagree...

But let's go with this for a moment. I am now curious from a theoretical perspective. Let's say it was generated by a financially oriented AI—why would that make the question (or my comment) any less significant?; The individual companies are meant as examples of successful companies people would recognize in that sector…"
Speculate on GOOG - what'd be the best countermove against DoJ slaps? ,"For those who were sleeping/partying on the weekend, the following happened:

* DoJ said, Google should divest off Chrome and may not reenter the browser market for five years
* prohibited from ""acquiring any interests in search rivals, potential entrants, and rival search or search ads-related AI products""
* halt all ""anticompetitive payments to distributors, including Apple, Samsung"" so that Google isn't the default search engine on their devices
* content creators can choose to opt-out of Google crawlers to train its AI

Most obvious historical comparison is case against Microsoft Corp. in 2001; the DoJ tried to split Microsoft up due to its hold over the web browser market on Windows, though this case **ultimately resulted in a settlement**. With that in mind, it is possible, the DoJ will go this way, this time.

* Search is close to 50% revenue of Google \[Q3 results\]
* Browsers market shares: Chrome 60%, Safari 18%, Edge 8% \[Source can be contested, because it's larger devices stats only\]
* Android - 70% market share in handheld devices

GOOG has to fight hard to ensure a high search traffic. It may have a few options up its sleeves.



||||
|:-|:-|:-|
|""Chrome"" as a stand-alone listed company like Opera browser.|Possibly the worst move. Average user unlikely to install a browser-only app, than stick with factory default browser on the device. ||
|Chrome+Gemini as a new company, to command an ""AI"" valuation.|Not likely to attract advertisers, until this new 'app' gets wild Chat-GPT like popularity. ||
|Android+Chrome as a new company, provides operating system for device manufacturers|Won't make sense, because Samsung already has their prop. version of Android. And to gain search traffic, Google again needs to partner with this new company, which is prohibited.||
|A company with ""personal suite"" of applications, Gmail, Calendar, Docs and Chrome bundled together|Chrome then gets 100's million users from Day-1. Still, above legal prohibition remains. ||
|Settlement|Make it all go away!||

Any other speculations? With so much uncertainty, the stock will remain under pressure with downward bias, until there's clarity on the case.

But at PE 22, even if total revenue of the demerged companies, takes a hit of 30%, it's still a great value.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gywuwe/speculate_on_goog_whatd_be_the_best_countermove/,66,"Google: Starts negotiations to sell Chrome to Alibaba. DOJ: Wait a minute…; The issue is that nobody else can buy chrome lol. Sell it to who Microsoft amazon oracle?; DOJ asked Google and Google said fuck off lol. This stock is so undervalued. You won’t see these prices in a year when it’s running 250+; Bribe Trump, that’s literally all it would take for it to go away.; I would buy Alphabet at the current price even without Chrome because Alphabet is showing strong growth across all sectors. 

Let’s really assume that profits would fall by 30 % with the disposal of Chrome, then the P/E ratio would increase by 60 %. Google would then still have a forward PE of <30 with growth of 15%. And a possible spin-off would not be an expropriation, but would happen in return for massive financial compensation for Alphabet or result in shares in the new holding company for current shareholders. And I know that Chrome is part of the Google ecosystem. But as long as Google exists, a separate mobile browser is not essential.

But thats just speculating about what happens in the absolute worst case scenario if Chrome is split off. 

Much more realistic to me is that the scope of what the Biden DOJ is currently calling for will be massively reduced once Trump takes office in January. Firstly, he has said that he would find it „unfair“ to split up Google, secondly, it does not fit in with his „America First“ doctrine to destroy one of the 10 or so companies that keep the USA globally relevant and thirdly, Matt Gaetz will not even become Attorney General in the Trump cabinet. He would certainly have been the most dangerous for Big Tech of the possible candidates.; Both my laptop and my work computer **DID NOT** come with Chrome installed. I did it myself as I like the product, not because I had no options or it was forced.

Chrome isn't the issue.; Google is the least evil of them. They provide incredible products, and all I have to do is use adblockers and I never see an ad on anything. A split up would be a pain. I would definitely try to get my Chrome data erased.
Metas products are garbage, and microsoft will never know how make a nice product.; Valuation is pretty low for a tech company which leads me to believe the market has already priced this in.; I am buying the fuck out of Google this week.  This is so fucking stupid on the DOJ's part it's unbelievable.  Also spez needs to sell Reddit to somebody stat.; It’s a case of big government ideologues gone haywire. Left-wing lawyers trying to make a name for themselves using taxpayer dollars.

First thing Google should do is make their case to Trump, who has common sense on these issues. If they fail at that, then they need to fight this all the way to the Supreme Court.; It's literally just noise.... Moronic headlines from journalists have no idea wtf they are talking about having you thinking Google is collapsing next week. It would be years before anything actually materializes.

Google can and will appeal. Instead of forcing Google to sell an asset in a transaction that would net Google $20B from the deal, the Supreme Court would rather take a fat multi-billion dollar settlement with $20B in their favor. And the world will keep spinning.  

In the meantime, I'll keep buying at a discount.; I honestly don't think selling Chrome makes any sense in this case. The judge ruled they acted anticompetitively by paying to be the default browser on safari and Firefox. 

Selling off Chrome makes no sense for that. I think the DOJ are just trying to cut google no matter what. Doesn't matter what google did or what makes sense. They just have an agenda.; [deleted]; Trump and MAGA view Google is biases against MAGA, so DOJ will pursue an antitust case against it.

Chrome, is a big part of googles ad tech because it collects personalize info on who you are and can target you with ads.

Fun fact. Your online presence can be uniquely be identified by your chrome version, extension and extension build versions. No need for cookies.

If google adwords had to pay market rates for that data, their margins would be alot lower.

Thats why they pay apple 20B per year to be default.  They make more than that off chrome.; Is there even a way to make money if Chrome is the only product in a spinoff company? Isnt the whole idea to steer users to Google search?; I'm sure Mozilla is waiting in the wing for Chromium Firefox release.; Well, google will appeal it, if the incoming administration choses to fight, things will be tied up for years, eventually there will be a meaningless settlement, lawyers get rich, we all get screwed again. 

  
Selling off chrome isn't going to do jack shit for the bottom line because it is advertising dollars they are going to get, and unless someone buys chrome and removes all the tracking shit and adblock blockers out of it, it will be irrelevant. Their marketshare has peaked. 

If the DOJ really wanted to remove the market stranglehold google has, they would have gone after exclusive agreements, and the integration for ad tracking across all their products.; Spin of chrome, chrome buys what's left of Google, change name to Google; just go long; The DoJ can fuck off on this one. The ruling will  get overruled; I think this makes Alphabet even more of a buy. If they abandon the action the shares will pop. If they force a sale, you’ll get shares in the spin off. Win win.; It's going to go away in January.  Everything about this set such a wide precedent that it could equally apply to Apple, Microsoft and Meta.  So unlikely anything will really happen.  A slap on the wrist fine and move on.; My first though: ""Elon 'll be offered to buy chrome to get closer to his super app ambitions for X."" Weirdly that sounds at least somewhat reasonable these days... after January 20th, who knows?; Government should back off. Companies are bigger than USA and should be above the law.; Get a new CEO that knows how to effectively interact with the hostile DoJ/EUC.; Google better act fast before the new admin, coz Trump and Elonia are not big fans of Google.; Spin off Chrome into a new company, wait 5 years, announce Google Titanium.; Chrome will be bought by either oracle or adobe.; Remove those censorship and woke, upcoming administration may give them a chance; Spin off chrome as a separate company.

Or DoJ will become a clusterfuck in January, so Google might not have to do anything.; Honestly, fuck Google. They haven't come out with anything good or useful in a long time. Their AI search sucks and all their ""hey Google"" products are terrible. Even their nest products are mid. For such a giant company it's a joke. They're like 10yrs behind the times.; I posted about this last week, but I think OPRA is a good play to hedge against it. Theres a possibility that some of these smaller browsers could see an increase in their browser market share. I think OPRA fits that bill; Shite🤣🤣; That sums it up. 

Google's response to DOJ had the word 'national security' a few times.; Whoopie! Another big trillion dollar tech company controlling the worlds largest web browser vs the other big trillion dollar company. Thank you DOJ!; I thought they wanted Google to split from chrome, not sell it.

As in: chrome becomes an independent company.; OpenAI could buy Chrome for more data and to put ChatGPT on every device that is running Chrome.; Yeah, I can't think of a company that can buy Chrome that wouldn't have similar monopoly issues. Plus, Chromium is open source, so it wouldn't be that difficult for Google to simply start a new browser unless the ruling forbids them from doing so.

So I'm not sure how selling Chrome is realistic or helpful when it comes to stopping monopolies. Similarly, while forbidding Alphabet from paying to make Google the default search engine on other platforms makes sense on paper, the result might be to kill or at very least severely hinder Chrome's only major non-Chromium competitor because Firefox heavily relies on those payments from Google.

Allowing users to opt-out of AI training and prohibiting Google from acquiring rival companies seems like good moves though, if the objective is to at least contain Google's dominance. I could see those happening.

Ultimately, I'm wondering how much Google's search business will end up impacted by the rise of ChatGPT, especially with OpenAI also dipping directly into search. I know Google has Gemini, but ChatGPT still appears to have the edge in consumers' minds. Keeping Microsoft as the comparison, I could see us entering an era post-Microsoft DOJ where Microsoft escaped intact, but it found itself in a diminished position anyway because while it continued to dominate the PC-business in terms of OS, it mattered less as people shifted increasingly to phones and Microsoft gradually found itself as an also-ran in that space. Of course, Microsoft eventually emerged from that stronger than ever, but there was a long period of Microsoft looking like a shell of its former self. 

Google might go through a similar period as a result of AI, especially because, like Microsoft at that time, consumer perception of Google is extremely low. That doesn't always matter because we've seen time and again that consumers will put up with a company they don't like if they're used to using their products, but it also makes them more willing to jump to a competitor if said competitor offers something that seems just as good or better, and the transition won't inconvenience the consumer. A negative feeling towards a company also makes consumers less willing to expand the number of products from that company they're using, which will perhaps work against Google as they try to compete in the AI space.

Of course, Google has mountains of money and resources, so writing them off is risky.; Microsoft never has a monopoly /s; Couldn't they just be split off into a stand alone company? Why does anyone need to buy it persay.; Private equity would buy; It will be sold to X because corruption; I’ll put an offer in for tree fiddy and the only change I’ll make it to play Never Gonna Give You Up each time you open a new browser tab.; Easy solution:

Force a sell and don't allow other monopolistic companies to buy it

Then Google will have to sell for a massive valuation loss and this will incentivize against Monopolies

But they won't do this; I've been holding google since around 2014 and I don't think it comes anywhere close to 250, but I wouldn't mind if it did.; Yeah seriously I bet this gets reversed within a month of Trump taking office just like all his felony charges.; G has a very low P/E when compared to emerging tech market companies in quantum computing, self-driving, AI infrastructure, and AI chat. If you look at the private equity valuations on openAI, Cerebras, they all have far higher P/E than G.; And their moonshot bets are very promising. Alphabet is already running self driving cars, transporting passengers and generating revenue in multiple cities.

If Tesla had achieved even a fraction of this, the stock would be up 50%; There is alot of AI companies positioning for search.  Ie perplexity, openAi, bing, Xai.

Their dominance is waning.; Bro.. did you have O.S. from Google? Windows comes with Edge pre-installed. MacBook has Safari. And, surely, Google notebooks come with Chrome.; Yeah about the as blocker thing.. They're gonna kill that; Dude, Google is pretty shady—they’re literally combing through all your data, from emails to photos to your Drive to maps to your search history. I’m not saying anyone else is much better, but they’re definitely not the least shady; they’re just as bad as the rest.

Edit: just to be clear, I am **not** in favor of Google being broken up. As a consumer I like the convenience of how well their products work together. I am just pointing out they are just as shady as their competition.; Their leadership is inept when figuring out how to deal with the DoJ/EUC compared to for example Microsoft.; why would he sell Reddit? Google is paying a fuck ton of money to scrape Reddit's data and all of our amazing posts.; Seems more like an easy way to implement punishment on google at least from the DoJ's perspective.; Pushing Google to sell chrome is likely just a bargaining chip. I'd wager that they will settle for google agreeing to not pay to be the default on other platforms (apple mostly).; This is my first thought too haha. Just wait three months and then grease Trump's palm. Lawsuit goes away.; > Fun fact. Your online presence can be uniquely be identified by your chrome version, extension and extension build versions. No need for cookies.

Wow, this is crazy. Is there an article acknowledging that people are doing this anywhere?; I actually don't think the worry here is what's going to be decided in the summer next year with Google and Meta in fact (although they have no cases at least as far as I know right now).

I'd say the concern would be that they get heavily pursued for censorship actually due to the events that transpired out of early 2021 for revenge.; I see social media regulation coming down the pipeline but this is antitrust lawsuit is bullshit.; I disagree on why they pay Apple.  I think they could easily NOT pay Apple and everything would be the same.    This actually happened in the EU already and no one switched engines really. In 2021 

I think they pay apple now because it’s the status quo, and Apple relies on that money.  Cutting it would be a literal act of war.  

This is geopolitics

It would be great if the DOJ cuts that payment tho and makes Apple prompt user for default.  That would be insanely bullish IMO; Trump, Elon, and Sundar have had several phone calls together

You don't need to know someone's browser version to know their web activity. You could simply use their public IP address. It's also not a problem unique to Chrome

Trump doesn't want to punish Google, he want to use it to his advantage.; Yes, we know Trump is in power.; Not if a company isn't allowed to pay to be the default search on Chrome.; It surprises me that the vast majority of people don't seem to understand that Google can appeal and think that corrective action will be taken against Google tomorrow.; hmmm..OK; found elon's burner; He has people for this; You think Sundar is going into DOJ meetings as his own defense attorney, and they don't have the best legal team money can buy?; Not sure why so many people think this rofl

https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/20/spacex-raises-1-billion-in-new-funding-from-google-and-fidelity/; Average person isn't gonna actively install Opera browser. What would very likely happen is, Chrome users getting a T&C pop-up to click away, informing them of new ownership, re-confirming their choice of search engine.


Yes, the seamless data collection and personalization will stop (or be difficult), but Chrome's market share won't come down by much.


If this sets a precedence, Apple and MSFT too will think twice before bundling their browsers in their ecosystem.; lol we took down that evil google to protect poor Amazon!; But does Chrome make money on its own?; i understood that also; Buy Chrome with whose money?; ChatGPT search is literally Bing.  And ChatGPT has been mainstream  for 2 years 

Given those two points, you should be able to test this theory by looking at traffic patterns over the last 24 months, and there really hasn’t been a shift from Google to Bing.  

At this point feels like fake news.  Price def held down by the narrative tho.  

Seems like a buying opportunity to me; No monopoly? Look at Office Productivity. Windows, Teams, Office, Linkedin, Github, Copilot and Azure DB, etc.; Not only they've to divest, Google cannot enter browser market for 5 years.; You do realise that the tech boom is aligned with apple hitting 1T and Nvidia going 200% a year? Basically the IA boom++; You've been holding GOOG for a decade over which it grew 500%, and you don't think GOOG will grow an additional 50% over its future?

I call bullshit or you're stupid or both.; He already said Khan is gone. 

The more interesting thing is the sheer volume of shills in the past week pushing for the divestment of chrome and hammering down of android. It makes you wonder who would benefit from these moves.; Exactly, was scrolling to find these comments. I think he's recently praised google too. New Prez/DOJ makes me think this will go away. I'm not much of a single stock guy, but have some Google I bought many years ago. Not selling.

I do think the biggest thing that could threaten Google is Apple or whoever replacing Google as the default search engine on iPhones and one that average people use. If Apple eventually comes up with their own and it's actually really good via Chat GPT or something, that could be a big deal for their ad business, especially if Google was ever forced to offload Chrome. But overall a great business growing well with Cloud, YouTube, Ads etc etc; Did you seriously put Bing and Xai in that list?; Doubt; Thats the talking point for 2 years now, yet, nothing happened. Google holds strong on to its market share and the last quarter showed record revenue for Search.; Prove it; The fuck? No shit a Chrome Book is going to come with Chrome. Would you expect a Chrome book to have safari or Edge or Netscape Navigator or some shit?

This is completely different than having an OS. You install windows and it doesn't come with Chrome, you have to seek it out and download it.; They've been saying this for what 5+  years? and ublock origin still works fine on Chrome.; They are super shady. But in exchange, all their products work reasonably-to-incredibly well *and* integrate with each other seamlessly *and* i get to pay with data instead of cash.; Noone needs to use any Google services. Use maps or another naviation system and there are a multitude of other email/search providers to choose from.; So is OpenAI tho; What do you mean?; So you think that the people running Google are just a bunch of dumba**es that have been paying Apple 20 billion dollars a year for nothing?; Because they always complain about Google search ""censorship of conservatives""?; Yes; Papa Satya; Wasn’t it literally 2k+ before the stock split; I expressed my view on this very clearly. Can you demonstrate that you actually understand my comment?; That makes no sense, MSFT is already throwing a lot of money into MS Edge to make it more relevant to users, what incentive does it have to abandon that effort and acquire Chrome?; lol edge"
Google stock thoughts ," think that google depends on Apple , if apple products fail, or if apple partner with another search engine then Google would fail

Edge and Bing are really good now , comes installed in 80% of the machines sold , if its good enough why bother downloading chrome ? and Bing looks almost exactly the same as google , 

Chrome Os is failing also, Android might get antitrust..  



What do you think? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gy9591/google_stock_thoughts/,0,"Terrible thread; Ask ten random people if they use bing? Or ever heard of it? Edge?; Don't really agree with this. 

If google was not the default search engine for other browsers people would change it to google. It's a verb for a reason even now. Tiny portion of people will pick duckduckgo or even Bing. 

Chrome has about 66.6% of the market. Even if Edge is installed on 80% of machines, guess what people search for on Edge? Chrome installation. And they search for it with Google. 

And despite the chatgpt, Search revenue is still growing, hitting 12% revenue growth in the latest quarter. Despite that, Google has been heavily investing in AI with their Gemini and AI overviews which personally are really great. 

To me the problem with google now is antitrust. DOJ wants google to sell off Chrome which would really hurt. But google is going to fight it hard. And also, personally, I don't think it makes sense since they lost the lawsuit over anticompetitive practices by paying apple $20B and other browsers to make Google the default. Had nothing to do with chrome. So it doesn't make sense to ask google to sell off chrome. 

Other lawsuit is over their ad network.; Major 2022 Meta vibes here. Sell your shares to me, thank you.; I have been buying…my hope, which is not a strategy, is that DT will deregulate and google will stop worrying about antitrust and focus on their core businesses.; A lot of people saying Google have dropped the ball, yet their revenue keeps growing?

Okay, they maybe don't have the best AI out there but there's so much more to them than that.
If you're only looking at chrome potentially being sold off as a reason not to buy, then you're missing the point.
Google is an absolute monster, and will roar back.

Its last earnings was another beat, which they've managed to do in 4 of the last 4 quarters.
Its PE price is cheap and below it's historical average.
Its revenue keeps growing and it's EPS last earnings was very good.
They have a very very small dividend and have been purchasing small amounts of stock over the last decade.

My PT is 200 in 2025, approximately 20% upside from here.; Bing is terrible.; Google is in a doward spiral from being behind in AI to having the DoJ wanting to break them apart. Unfortunately Google is my largest position but I am not adding.; personally, GOOGL is in my avoid list now.; Sell google, but not for the reasons you said. It’s because I’m finding it easier to go to chat GPT and search.

If you want to have the librarian walk you to the section to tell you where the answer is Google it.

If you want to go to the section, open the page and point at the paragraph go on chat GPT

When innovation comes to a business was that has 90% market share, they won’t keep 90% market share and the stock is based on those ad earnings.

Great past, may have an okay future, but it might also become IBM or yahoo; Goog lost… I noticed right away in 2022 when Microsft beat them to openai and chatgpt… then their fumble on releasing bard… it’s been downhill since then… now DOJ lawsuit. Unless they drop superior AI they will go the way of Cisco; [deleted]; bloated monopoly, it's back to where I sold it in august lol.; He lost me at:

> Edge and Bing are really good now

Bing sucks so bad. Can’t ever find what I’m looking for when I use it by accident. How is it still so bad after like 20 years?; i can tell where your retirement fund is parked lol!; Why ? Just a thought for conversation; Random person here, honestly when Google isn’t my first auto search engine I get trash from bing 😅🤣 tend to still use google search!; Switched from chrome to safari and edge as backup. In our company (huge one) it’s mostly edge as well. Seems like Microsoft trying to push it with their office package; whats your point with this? bing became a household term this year with chatGPT for my family at least; No yes, 100% for now googling is a verb and people are used to it, but bing is getting good, check the look and results, its very very similar, just saying that google could loose market share to competitors; I agree. this is headed lower and then will climb back up. 

by your own metric, meta loses **half** of its value 2022-2023 and then 2x its price from 2022 over the next yearish; Hahaha just some conversation, well i want to sell, but also maybe its undervalued now? Hmm; Yes growing revenue because they push ads in search much more than before , most top links are sponsored by; and yet…
https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-singles-out-googles-competitive-edge-generative-ai-2024-03-14/; Same its one of my biggest position, just a bit worried with this, but i don’t think it will actually be broken apart,  Microsoft is much bigger of a monopoly, dosnt make sense; Most people search the internet for products, news, websites, not school essays; Youtube, android, Maps, it has alot to it , so not quite yet; Not really, its just in a risky position i think, but wanna be proven wrong; He's actually might be on right track, speculating on different outcomes for Google.


Obviously, it'd be terrible for just ""Chrome"" to be a listed company like OPRA browser, no-one cares.


I'd speculate, Google would spin off Chrome+Gemini as a new company, to command an ""AI"" valuation.


Otherwise, a company with ""personal suite"" of applications, Gmail, Calendar, Docs and Chrome bundled together. So that users of one product will get Chrome by default. 


They'll do their best to retain search traffic. But even if their revenues drop 50%, the current PE of 22 becomes 44, which is still a fair valuation for a tech giant.; It's terrible thread, because a lot of blatant statements (more like personal opinions) are dished out. Market data and the recent Q3 results suggest otherwise.


Are you speaking about smartphones or larger devices? Android is 70% market share for smartphones, handheld devices.


On desktops and laptops, Edge has 8% market share, compared to Chrome 60%, followed by Safari 18%.


Personally, I use Edge because I'm on windows ecosystem, but I always switched to google.com on Edge, because Bing search is just terrible, for any meaningful fact finding. Sure, if I just want to check a recipe, it can be OK, but for serious information, I find Google ranks more credible websites first, whereas Bing seems like ""tourist information desk"" with obviously gimmicky sites.; Every company I’ve worked at uses both chrome and edge because certain sites, soft phones, etc work better on each browser; My point is as follows: ask ten random people if they use bing? Or Edge? Or ever hear of either one?; what the hell is your family up to; Have they lost market share? Or are you predicting they will? 

They're still like 90% or so.; Yeah, I really think folks are underrating the possibility that at the very minimum the S&P doesn't pull back-to-back-to-back +20% years and in the worst case, doing something not fun like oh snap, having a negative year.

I know Trump was Mr. Stock Market in his tenure, but in spite of me hating him, I do feel like he's set up poorly for a continuation of that with the S&P flirting with 6k and probably going over to end the year.

In a world where next year is hypothetically like a mish mash of 2018 and 2022 maybe, Google would very likely be a key underperformer at least until the court case is wrapped up.; Yes, let's forget about Google Play and their Cloud Revenue which is growing double digits every year atm.; And yet Microsoft isn't getting targeted by the DoJ.

>Wary of Google's increasing use of artificial intelligence in its search results, regulators also advised Mehta to ensure websites will be able to shield their content from Google's AI training techniques.

They keep buying out companies and have a monopoly on Office productivity with Windows, Teams, Office, Linkedin, Github, Copilot and Azure is the fastest growing cloud provider.; Yikes, the fact you think chatGPT is only used for school essays shows how out of touch you are with AI and the current state of things.; Android keeps losing market share to iOS and maps is easily replaceable with Apple Maps. I don't even think Youtube is making money.; I’d be fine with a spinoff so I get shares in the new company. I don’t see this new administration’s DOJ enforcing this.

Need some advice on where to invest $3 million,"
Recently my uncle passed away very unexpectedly. He left behind 3 million I believe in his portfolio. My aunt doesn’t know what to do with this money. I have been learning about stocks for a little over a month now, just reading some books and trading myself. I have made $500 when Trump got elected and because of this I guess my family thinks i’m the most qualified to give advice on what to do. I’m only 20 with 10k to my name and now it sounds like they are ready to make big financial decisions based off of what I say. I really need advice on what to do here cause I honestly have no idea. It seems he is already getting $48,000 a year off dividends. I just got off the phone with my Mom and my aunt seems most concerned with securing a method of getting passive income, so I suggested investing into dividend focused index funds. I also told them they could put the money into something like VOO if they want growth. I don’t know if this is even good advice for $3 million, to me thats more money than I can even comprehend. My mom said shes gonna send me the company’s he was invested into to make sure they are good companies, and I have no idea how to do that but I just said I’ll look cause they seem to be understandably upset and I didn’t want to just say no. I’m in way over my head on this so any advice will be greatly appreciated. My mom said she is literally going to write down what I say. If anyone is wondering why they won’t get a financial advisor, it is because they don’t want to pay them large percentages of the money. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gxdb1b/need_some_advice_on_where_to_invest_3_million/,0,"Tell your aunt to find a CFP Fiduciary Advisor to provide professional advice. With that much money, you don't want to just guess what to do and hope for the best.; Hire a professional financial advisor; Go to Fidelity.  Call them. They should have hourly rate advisors.  Don’t take an advisor that takes a % of the portfolio yearly. Setup the account, likely a simple index fund tracking portfolio. Dollar cost averaging in may be a good idea for such a large chunk. 

She might want:
- 10% (so $300k) permanently in a high yield savings acct, 4% per year.  This is emergency hedge against market drops.  Don’t touch it unless there is a downturn, then pull from this while waiting for recovery
- 90% rest into brokerage. Can dollar cost average in to hedge against volatility (we did just have an election, there are a lot of ideas in the new administration which could cause markets to bump around). VOO is a good index to track. 
- Fidelity is a reasonable place for this all. 
- careful about which financial advisor you choose.; VOO is fine for diversification across the entire market for low fees. Municipal bonds are good for relative safety and some tax-free income, though you can do some research and make it ""more tax-free"" by getting the right bonds. And treasury bonds are considered the safest investment. In order to make a good decision you have to ask the right questions and the most important question is what is their goal? Is it income? Growth? Keeping it safe?; As a former finance guy, I can tell you that people new to money like this usually make bad decisions - not because they’re dumb but because it causes fear of loss so they tend to overestimate what $3mm can do. They spend it fast as hell without thinking about what they will need in 3 years.

3 years later their cars and homes are fully owned but their jobs don’t support a cash out so then they succumb to aging assets and out of control expenses. Families implode fighting over this. They can’t stomach the idea they are “Rich” yet still live “this way.”

My big suggestion is to find out what your family’s goals are first. Like think about the next 20 years. Homes. Kids. Education. Retirement. Kids (yeah, kids twice).

Gather that information as a family and tell them this, “I don’t want to plan for next year or even 3 years. I want to look at our future together and make it easier for everyone in the next generation. Money won’t make us happy but it will make it easier if we know what we want.”

Take that information to a senior financial advisor that’s willing to talk through the plan and give you an analysis. One big account for the whole family may not be best - it may be that you need some trusts, some Roth IRAs, and some fixed income accounts (per your dividend comment).

If you really don’t want to use an FA, then go learn how to match your portfolio to your risk level, taxation, and prepare yourself for a halftime job. Your family will never stop asking questions and that’s what you pay the FA for bruv. 

Be smart and don’t let your short term defeat the long term.; [removed]; I will talk to them; I would generally say to stay away from percent based FAs but an FA really could provide value. OP, be wary of making huge changes though immediately though, your uncle probably knew what he was doing. Consider he probably invested with your aunt in mind as well.; Go to Morgan Stanley - you want someone over the age of 50 btw.; With this kind of money, YOU don't want to be personally responsible for what happens. 



Look at it this way - Your aunt doesn't know much about investing and finance. You seem to know slightly more. You don't really know the right questions to even ask her. If she follows your recommendations, and the market tanks 30%, the $3m is now $2m. Will she blame you? Do you want that responsibility on your shoulders? 

  
I get not wanting to pay fees, but this is a situation where it's likely highly worthwhile. Between just figuring out appropriate allocations, income planning, tax issues, estate issues, etc, a good CFP likely can provide a lot of value.; No he has no clue. His stocks are apparently from companies he worked at over a 20 year span. My aunt found out he maxed out 5 credit cards after he died leaving them to deal with it. He canceled his life insurance too. Its like he was trying to fuck them over before he died; AUM fees are fine. Just make sure they’re a fiduciary. $3m range should be roughly 40-50bps which is very reasonable given the planning they can do here."
Thoughts on building a 10Y high risk portfolio,"Over the past few years I’ve built a portfolio consisting of S&P, Apple, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, JPM and BRK. It has done rather well, consistently giving returns of 25%+ annually (except 2022). 

However in recent times my conviction on adding more capital to this portfolio has waned. I just feel the best days in terms of returns for some of the big tech groups may not be what they were for the past decade.

I could 100% be wrong and there is no doubt there is certain bias seeing the return of my smaller positions this year dwarfing the ones of the traditional blue chip guys if you will.

So saying all this I’m considering: 

50% S&P

10% Hood

10% Rddt

10% Rolls Royce

10% Cava

5% Lunr

5% ASTS

Quick rationale for each:

Hood: Expanding to Europe and offering very exciting new products like Hood Gold 

Rddt: Fastest growing social media, ARPU and monetisation only getting better and seeing many more people using

Rolls Royce: Slight European exposure, building low cost Nuclear plants and capturing the wide body aircraft market

Cava: Fantastic management, strong customer retention and expected to double stores in next 5 years

Lunr & ASTS: Moonshot (literally), this is just in case space works out and much more speculative 



So having said all that, what is everyone’s thoughts on this proposed portfolio allocation. Is this too risky, not enough diversification into the different sectors?

If it were me I would take many high risk positions and let the winners win and the losers fade away. Probably 25+. If 1-3% of your portfolio was in stocks like Netflix, Nvidia, Monster, etc early on, you would still be rich. Hope it works out for you but that’s going to be a very volatile ride.

You are supposed to reduce 50% of ""S&P, Apple, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, JPM and BRK"" and put it into TLT, but trying to do at wrong side.

Try yourslef and let us revisit after 1 year !

Remindme! 1 Year.; Microstrategy; Lol you’ve picked mainly stocks that have pumped big time already: Hood, Rolls etc; Hood- i think the 24/5 trading will get more attention, for better or worse.

Lunr/spec- maybe less exposure.

Cava- i held that bag for a year or so, sold, then it took off. If you can get it on a pullback and they actually do double in scale over 5 years then good on you

Rolls- i think there are better plays in that space but that's just an opinion

Reddit- i think the biggest value here is data for AI. Reddit has almost 2 decades of data on about every topic you can think of. It's a lot of echo chamber and hive mind, but brilliant insight. If I had some extra money right now this is where I would put it after that Seasonal Q1 pullback; I like these picks and I’m tempted by all of them myself, but are we overly influenced by what’s shot up quite recently? Two years ago, these companies  were quite a bit cheaper and not top of mind for me. Perhaps a way to account for this selection bias is to buy half the position in these now, and half if they come down after a year or two.; Mstr; Uhhh you have Reddit and hood in there but not Palantir?; I'd just do Nasdaq, maybe defense sector without any leverages.


To avoid absurd risk, fees. 


Im too stupid to pick individual stocks, keep that in mind.; This is a good way to cut your gains in half; Cava is prob done growing like a monster, and why 50% S&P? Can just do TSLA NVDA instead and make 5x more; What will happen - at some point the next 10 years, this market will take a 1-2 year hit of 30% to 50% drawdown. That's for the indices. You are fine if you buy index stocks and DCA with a time horizon of 20-30 years. Markets tend to have 8-15 years of nice returns, then 1 decade or so of chop. See 70's - 80's, then 2000-2010.

What will happen to your high beta portfolio is you will see 80% drawdown when that happens, instead of 30-50%. All stocks go down in a crisis as people scramble for liquidity. Online forums, overpriced pita bread, brokerage correlated to bitcoin, and a luxury carmaker will all get obliterated. And since the market hates you personally, this will be right when you need the cash for a downpayment or a car. You will panic sell just like you are panic buying right now. You will give up, say, well, I should have stuck with indexes, and become an index DCA person like 90% of salaried employees. 

If your time horizon is that long, you should take advantage of high rates as a guaranteed offset until they collapse, which will only happen if there are bad economic times - which is coincidentally the time to buy more indexes. 

Time horizon being long isn't a logical reason to take more risk immediately. That'snot how compounding works.; Misunderstood the comment, thought you meant all in on rocket lab lmao😭; It was between lunr and rklb, honestly could have been either; Exactly I don't mind taking this risk as I have a long time horizon and accept some of these will potentially not work out in 10 years time.; I mean sure if only I had the liquidity to make 25+ high risk bets with any meaningful amounts.

|-|-|-|-|; I really appreciate someone finally commenting on the individual positions!

Hood thesis is they're getting lot of deposits with their upto 3% boost which will be reflected in greater trading volume. They've expanded into UK and already doing well imagine rest of Europe.

Cava I already own 30 shares but won't touch it at current levels. Like you said waiting for a pullback or maybe DCAing over coming quarters.

What is it you don't like about RR. For me their SMR play has yet to truly begin and they're one of the few players that have actual experience in small sized reactors. Plus their current defence and aerospace business isn't going anywhere. 

Reddit is leveraging AI incredibly well. Their targeting is getting better and I think their biggest boost is not just from LLM monetisation but having Google promote them on their front page. What's a price point you'd be comfortable getting back into reddit as I keep waiting for it to fall below 100 but doesn't seem like it's happening anytime soon.; There's definitely an argument to be made about recency bias. But then again which half decent hasn't shot up quite a bit recently? I'm struggling to find value at these price points.

Own a few shares in each and will continue buying on a monthly basis to keep my cost basis from exploding with a big lump sum investment.; This guy gets it. Bravo; I honestly don't get what they're selling precisely and find their opaquness too uncomfortable. Additionally their yearly growth is below 30% for last two years which doesn't imply strong future growth to justify their stock rise.; I have 50%	 allocated into indexes and also want to build an individual stock portfolio. Since I enjoy conducting thesis and then putting money behind my convictions which so far has worked well. 

However ofc in a bull run practically everything just goes up and seems to work well..; Because I'd prefer to have index exposure in case my individual stocks start underperforming and lower overall risk.

Why do you believe Cava growth story is over? Just achieved profitability and expecting to open 50 or so stores annually.; I’m up on rocket lab and I considered diversifying but my thoughts are that rocketlab feels more tangible.; Google is now a great ""high risk"" holding 🤣  Also, look at BABA ; Do not you feel SPX/NDX are at ATH. You got all excellent stocks jumped this much by indexes ATH.; Here's my .02. RR- there are other movers in this space who have more resources dedicated to SMR. If you want a name with some exposure,  I understand RR. If you want a SMR play, there are better names. IMO

 Reddit- ya honestly I don't have a number in my head. I don't think Wallstreet still has a solid grasp on how to value this company. It's going higher. If AI is what we hope it is, it's going much higher. I don't have spare cash to throw at it rn or I would. For now, I wait to see if seasonality or a non name specific event happens and I can get a 10%+ drop over a week or so; I understand but the title said high risk - and for cava the PE is already absurd; By more tangible do you mean making much greater revenues already and being further ahead in their monetisation or is it more product related?; A dumb question: why invest in BABA when you could invest in the leveraged etfs?; Yes both indexes are basically at their ATH. But if I only invested when SPX dipped I would have missed out on some great gains. Plus I firmly believe time in market > timing the market.; Very interesting 2 cents. When you talk about other players in SMR you mean Oklo? I picked RR since they have a very solid existing business and will get lots of UK governmental support and contracts to succeed.

I think wallstreet institutional is starting to join the Reddit train as they wake up to company's solid growth figures. Feel like the 120s at start of the week was a nice buy opportunity. I'm sure it'll have random  falls in coming weeks gonna keep some cash on hand to capitalise when it does imo; Is PE the most relevant metric for a company that just broke even? Shown pretty good same store and new store top line growth. But I agree wouldn't touch it at current price levels; It just feels like they are trading on real things happening compared to trading more on sentiment; OKLO is a good example. Like every theme or sub industry in the early days, it's hard to say who the winners will be. Maybe pick more than one. Maybe put a position into an etf as well; Aren't all the space stocks to an extent trading on sentiment?; Everything trades on sentiment to some degree. But my comment was really about the extent to which things trade on sentiment, not whether they do at all. It feels like rocketlab is trading on sentiment plus real things as opposed to merely sentiment and expectations of future real things."

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Absolutely no one. However, it turns out to bad a fantastic business, especially in the current environment. 

Heard [this](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2kkZmuO6uMy6bCF5vydzhZ?si=5ON8JsfiTGOuORcIeuS69A) breakdown of NMIH and I've become obsessed. Trading extremely cheap for one, and generating a ton of cash for two.

What really caught my ear wax the [combined ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/combinedratio.asp), which is a measure of underwriting profitability. 100 is neutral, not making or losing money. Lower numbers equal more profitable. 

Progressive has a combined ratio around 90.

Kinsale, one of my favorite longs, is around 77-78.

NMIH is around 28.

That's obscene. They're making about 72% margins on underwriting. Plus they get to monetize their float. 

Well worth a listen if you have an hour.; Thinking of building a position in GOOGL and holding long term. Also selling calls along the way for a bit of premium once I have enough shares. At a PE of 22 I cannot see it going much lower than this but what do I know 🤷‍♂️; $IESC

In addition, we see opportunities to provide all of our operating segments with additional capital to drive further organic growth.

I may say a lot of wrong things or speak in sadness on a certain stock, but the thing that I was pretty confident on here is that you were going to have to 3 day rule things here with the fact it was being hammered like it reported earnings that were ""just off"" from what was preferred.

I'm amazed I've pulled back to back great days overall. I absolutely made the right decision to sell 100 shares there.; With MSTR I honestly am having a hard time telling apart what might be investor optimism in its BTC strategy and what is a retail frenzy feeing a short term trade loop by bigger players like the meme stocks back in early 2021.; Decent Europe day so far, I have stocked up on a lot more adyen recently.


Nbis sold puts doing really well will close soon, whoever bought those got slammed; Amazing to see people unironically writing the same comments as my shitposts about IONQ/RKLB. Though I think my nonsensical back of the envelope, $1T TAM, 70% margin, 40% market share calculations are the most quantitative DD I've seen on either of these companies. Now to these investor's credit, right now they're all raking in money (unless these are high schoolers using their $500 in allowance). Making money is more important than doing it in a dignified manner. Just don't think this will persist for much longer before gravity sets in.

Up 38% above $13, they want us to think its up 50% from their price target? LOL idiots.; What’s going on with $LUNR? $15.34 atm.; No one cares, but I added heavily to my EOSE position this week after my buy signal triggered (taking out the 2.10 daily equals then going back above it very quickly). Added a bunch at 2.13 then more at 2.31 and trimmed the extra shares at 2.61 today.

ATAI also triggered a buy signal for me this morning, but wasnt paying attention and didnt enter until 1.52. Got out at 1.67 and have a buy order at 1.58 but it dropped to 1.59 and hasnt triggered yet.

The deals they signed with all the sports networks are causing them to acquire millions of members a year 

We are primed for this to be the next blockbuster stock; It's kind of funny stock to want to buy, but RL is actually pretty interesting right now based off the valuation. It's actually performed pretty well this year and the valuation isn't anything too crazy. 

PEG is at 1.79, PE is at 20, forward PE of 16. Solid ROI of 15% and great gross margins for a retailer at 64%.

* MBLY - January 25 Call, $21 strike, $518,000 premium
* UAA - December 27 Call, $8 strike, $2,200,000 premium; Im going to finally take the plunge and buy QUBT and IONQ today, they are on a massive momentum. Hoping for a 20-40% gain. Im going to be rich today. They do 20-40% per day.; Maybe I got very lucky and market is bloated - but I feel like the best stocks are those which never get talked about.

I am up \~40-50% on TKO, ISRG and LEU, and up 300% on IONQ - all in last \~6 months. They do get mentioned but rarely and only after green days.

AAgain - maybe the market is too bloated and everything is up. But SP 500 is not up as much is same time period. So they are outperforming the market as of now.; $PYPL is still one of the strongest fundamentally.

Investing is so easy in this environment; Bought a couple lotto tickets today, makes about as much sense as the stock market to me.

Two companies I have invested in made more money than most 3rd world countries over the last quarter and are dropping in price.

One because investors are mad that the company is spending money while making more than most 3rd world countries, the other because it is just to big and would have to make more money than France to impress anyone, anymore.

I actually read an article ""downgrading"" the second because, and I quote ""sales will begin to slow down in 2026"".

Actually the lottery makes more sense.; B uy the dip never fails.; A lot of bull posts getting down-voted.

Pretty much sums up this market; It's going to go up no matter what happens. Monday of Thanksgiving week = free money meltup.; MUSA is so boring I often forget I own it and that's it's up a ton. You never hear about it, it just chugs higher and continues to shrink their share count. Oh yeah, it's beaten 5/7 of the magnificent 7 over the last 5 years.; I always like your posts. 
Boring as hell companies with steady growth…just like Lynch did back then. With all that big tech and +xxx% gains on certain stocks, you forget what investing really is or was.; Same actually, but I've been holding CROX since October 2023...; I'm watching it very closely. What are chances it drops to 150 lol; bitcoin is a scam. If I cant even buy anything with it, what use does it have. Why do we even need this? is it solving a problem?; It's definitely gotten into the ""greater fool"" part of the hype cycle so I'd be looking for exits and eventually considering shorts personally.; The rocket lab stuff is so interesting. Like it's been my lotto ticket stock for years. Stoked to see it go up so much, but no way would buy it at it's current valuation. 

Kind of lowkey hate how it's become a meme, but it's one the stock I told myself I would never sale.; Market is undervalued and every day we wake up we realize and buy higher. Ionq will probably be $50 by end of year.; I quit waiting for a dip and have been buying.; Schd is a great diversifying holding for people who are loaded up on mag 7; Decrease in Chinese consumers and also a general sales decline in brands like LV and Dior. I don't own any shares but overall I think there's still steady demand in the long term, just not at the pace it was when China's economy was stronger. I see it trading sideways for quite a bit. They're also buying Paris FC and starting a global partnership with Formula 1 next year which is kinda interesting; I think it's a worthwhile place to look for entries.; It always seems crazy to me to think that banks are doing anything with price targets other than trying to trick people into doing what they want for their own positions. If they know what's going to happen, they're going to use that info for themselves, not share it. (I think we're saying the same thing?); Bruh u calling out companies for rich valuation but go heavy in eose?; Hey I’m a long time holder, haven’t tried trading it yet. More of a “lottery ticket” play. Could be zero or $20/share. I have just under 12,000 shares; Have you read the short reports on them? Not bothered at all by them? They sounds very dodgy to me, I had them down as the NKLA of the battery space.

Also seems a massive contradiction how you’re frequently saying how the market is massively overvalued. The valuation metrics of this company are atrocious.; Do you have concerns about the next administration rolling back funding/loans that EOSE has received? Or reducing their potential business (less solar and wind)? I'm unsure about solar in the short-term (hence why I exited NXT and FSLR about a month ago); long-term is a different story. I would've thought that grid-scale batteries would have similar concerns?; yawn; Retail is so hard. You're in....then you're out. 

Just of note from other apparel names I've looked at: holiday sales are priced in. The market knows this is their best quarter. It's only if they overachieve on that overachievement that helps. 

That said, they are reducing both debt and share count, which is nice. Probably one of the more enduring brands out there right now. Not my market, but they seem to be steady. 

Also, just my pet theory....blue collar employment will slowly edge out white collar employment. Might be a headwind for RL since I would imagine they're big in business casual.; I'd like them to be named pump-it fridays. Love it. I feel like Icarus.; They haven't mattered since 2022 and never will again.; I lived near the site and have meet some  old timers.  Great stories. The one I remember that gave him an indication they were doomed was when Avaya was spun-off from Lucent. Avaya started buying competitive routers and network equipment just to function - they did not even use their own equipment.; Which documentary? Idea labs?; [Starting valuations made no sense](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1en1kf3/rstocks_daily_discussion_options_trading_thursday/lh5zgoi/). Today? No clue which is right, hence my reduced position now.; How is that annoying?   If something pays off, why be annoyed how or when it paid off?; To each their own, but I would be careful with some of those markets. Auto and industrial have been basically n bear markets for like at least a year and no bottom really insight. 

Even on VSH last earnings presentation: 

[https://ir.vishay.com/static-files/e6536ed3-25f4-401c-86b8-26900ee4e897](https://ir.vishay.com/static-files/e6536ed3-25f4-401c-86b8-26900ee4e897)

Go to slide 3. 

Industrial is down 18% YoY, auto is down 12% YoY, and other which is looks to be AI computer is down 32% YoY. 

I do own some names in the aerospace/defense, which is a pretty strong market right now. They aren't semi plays, but more around optical and components, like $DRS and $MPTI. 

The other thing is that the aerospace only makes up like 8% of their total revenue compared to auto and industrial is like 72% of their business.; MBLY is really depended on politics... good luck on that :); I posted about IONQ months back and everyone said it burns cash. Now I am up 300% - never thought I would see such numbers lol.

I am not selling for decade since that is what I decided on when I bought it. But I feel like it is bloated now - partly because of your comment lmao.; Lol; I own 3 stocks that are never talked here that all hit new 52 week highs this week.  Deere & Co, Kinder Morgan, and AT&T.  All 3 are in different market sectors and are non-tech.

Edit that to 4 as Armstrong World $AWI just hit a new 52 week high this morning.; Check out FOUR.  

No whimpering here.; Many individual stocks will outperform the market, that's the nature of the, but they are usually also riskier. That said, I'm in IONQ too.; Was a great deal under $60. At today's prices, I would be more careful.; Trump trade continues. PLTR up as well.; Brad Gerstner sold all his UBER to buy TSLA; Based on what?   (I’m not saying you’re wrong - just surprised you went to “bank run” vs just way over-priced right now); The fed and the government will do ANYTHING to prevent HTM assets from having to be sold on the open market. That will cuase a disaster making 2008 look like a fucking picnic at the park on a nice sunny day with cardinals and blue jays singing; Saw that, not sure why, but the stock has had such a solid run. 

The IESC report this morning still makes me bullish around electrical and reshoring plays.; Google on days like yesterday; Nke.  Lvmh.  Lulu.  Okta.; I would look into the semi conductor equipment names. A lot of them are great value now, but it could be a few more quarters until things look better. There is some China risk as well. 

In the chip world, autos and industrials have been slowing down for like the past year. So those markets still haven't bottomed yet, but hopefully should. So there still can be pain for a bit, but if you are looking long term, there is some great value.; Top-line Data for RETHINK-ALZ 52-week Phase 3 trial Expected Before the End of 2024


https://www.cassavasciences.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cassava-sciences-reports-q3-2024-financial-and-operating-results; The only way we will see a resurgence in offshore drilling is if crude plateaus at a much higher price than its current level. I do believe this will happen, but not due to Trump's policies or red tape cutting - it will be the shale basins rolling over in the next few years.; I trimmed some to put in Googl; Do you think they will split?; Someone has probably used it before but I just thought of it on the spot as my sarcastic retort to his dumb ""PE bro"" comment.

You know we are near the top when people are condescending and mock people who care about index wide valuations and earnings not being in touch; lol here we go; Same. Google isn't going anywhere until we get more clarity on the DOJ case. Best case scenario it keeps dropping and we can gobble up shares around $140-$150.; PLTR is another beat down 2022 stock that has been an amazing ride in 2024.; Unfortunately, you cannot consistently have 80% of market gains driven by PE expansion instead of earnings growth.

SPY EPS is now low single digit % ahead of Q4 2021 and SPY is 30% higher.

Enjoy the gains while they last, PE can sadly not inflate to infinity (well, maybe it can, who knows); Also as I said, these r a hedge against big tech stocks like amzn meta googl; Good job with that one! Took an ‘L’ with it myself - had about 0.5% of port as part of my ‘bag o’ QC’ back about $0.75 or whatever but decided to consolidate into IONQ, RGTI, and QBTS.

Can’t complain though too much in the short term - those have been ripping face as well (though not quite as hard as QUBT).

Just be careful - after today’s ripper I think it might have leapfrogged both QBTS and RGTI. Not saying that means much, but it’s heady days for sure.; > I actually read an article ""downgrading"" the second because, and I quote ""sales will begin to slow down in 2026"".

Considering the expectations baked into the price, this makes sense. Said company needs to achieve 2x ROA and 64x its current EPS to be ""fair value"".; If you think the lottery makes more sense, buy lotto tickets. I'll keep buying stocks.; I'm not, but that's awesome. Congrats on making some money; I wonder what will happen when the NFL Christmas day games take down the servers again.; As long as multiples don't matter tsla has no top; Are you serious or kidding? In an actual fearful environment or bear market big tech will be down and space/quantum will be way down; That's not a hedge at all. Space and Quantum are high risk and would get pummeled in a downturn. A hedge would be looking at blue chip corporate bonds or durable consumer staples for example.; google lol; Hahaha nice one.; Trump could announce adding BTC to the US balance sheet or something like that over the weekend and MSTR could open up 30% monday.

Thats the problem with trying to short speculative bubbles or momo driven bubbles; I think there's a pretty low risk. The average credit rating of mortgage holders is close to 760. If people have jobs, they pay their mortgage. 

I do think there are some recent homebuyers that are banking on refinancing and may not get it, but will they default? Probably not. If they're not underwater they can easily sell of needed. 

Mortgage insurance is sort of a pain because you pay a premium to protect the lender from default. Unless there's a mass of defaults, it's a great business.; The same Republicans who claim they are anti regulation?; Republicans are fucking stupid people. 


Their beef with Google is not the business, it is their stupid persecution complex which their awful media landscape reinforces daily. 


Negative articles are written about Republicans because they keep doing fucking reprehensible shit. That those articles are visible in search pages is not something which can be regulated. ; I mean it's the Biden DOJ trying to break them up, I actually feel like Trump might pull back on that push.; i cant imagine it'd be much worse than the current administration out of national interest; It happens. You’ve also made some great buys along the way. 

I want to say when I asked about this company a few years ago, you were the only person to even engage with the post. ; MSFT has barely done shit all year. I’m not concerned about MSFT at all (famous last words); What's wrong with MSFT?; Yes you are right, I just found it funny; \*\*\*\* the gag seven.  Well, except NVIDIA.  Yeah that one.. but the rest.... sit...

Oh and maybe Tesla.  Is it mag seven?  Why I aint know no more...; I think I remember being in with you at one point, I have been in and out a few times trying to swing it; You can definitely buy a lot of things with bitcoin.; You can't buy anything with a block of gold, why do people buy that?; The point of bitcoin, which I believe everyone knows whether they admit to it or not, is for the price of bitcoin to go up so they get richer. 

Any other story or reason given is only to get the price to go up.; We just gon’ gloss over Silk Road? Lmaooo; What makes you think you can't buy anything with it? BTC has been an accepted payment for over 10 years; What problem does an expensive painting solve? Just because crypto can’t be used in the sense that you want to doesn’t mean other people won’t gladly overpay for it if they feel it has value. Just because I think the Mona Lisa is stupid and worthless doesn’t mean other people do. I think there is a balance point somewhere. I just don’t know how to find it.; DJT will start taking payments in Bitcoin ;); That's my instinct too, this value is intrinsically tied to BTC and that has a natural (in so far as one can consider it ""natural"") boom-bust cycle of value and hype that seeing this dip down seems like a no brainer.

What gives me pause is that BTC  when it booms can either peak for just a day or two, or it can hang out for a awhile before dropping (late 2021 compared to early 2021), this last price ""peak)"" (BTC holding steady at around 60,000) lasted from March to October and instead of droping, only rose more this time.

With the incoming administration being more crypto friendly (theoretically), I could see a case for this hype cycle artificially lasting longer than folks might thinks.; I've been tempted to sell and try to buy back in after a pullback, but who knows when that'll happen and to what extent.

I'm just going to keep holding and consider averaging up eventually when it cools down. My initial cost basis is small anyways; It had a huge pullback last year. 

There's zero chance I'm buying at current valuations.; loaded on semis so this also works for me :); 100%; Big difference between a microcap that is essentially pre revenue and a multi billion dollar company trading at nosebleed valuations. We have good estimates on what aCOST or PLTR is gonna do 12 to 24 mo ths out. EOSE has major uncertainty and that's priced in.

If EOSE even does 50% of 2026 expectations, it's a steal at today's valuation. If they don't, then it's very overpriced. Risk reward at this level is excellent if you follow the industry.  

Also, I trade it and constantly go down to 0 shares or up to 30k based on sentiment and TA.; The short reports on them are a joke. Iceberg is a terrible short book and people on Twitter literally predicted the short report the day before it came out because of massive short term put sweeps lol. I sold the morning before the short report and bought after ut was down 15%. Thank you iceberg!

I said it below, but you don't value eose on 2024 numbers, you value on 25 or 26 numbers and apply a steep discount based on execution risk. My numbers have eose as over 15 a share in 26 as my base case. Obviously I'm very bullish on them and not pricing in nearly as much execution risk as the market.; I do hVe some co cerns for sure, not gonna lie.

But at thr end of the day, the writing is on the wall and green energy plus batteries to smoothen out supply is the most cost effective option in the medium and long term. The market is already sniffing that out and states like Texas have been going big into solar and wind.

Eose is also pretty much 100% American made which is a good thing for trumps presidency, while tsla energy storage is sourced from China. 

The IRA has been a big win for many US blue collar states which all went to Trump so I can't imagine a full repeal of the IRA and the tax credits are all for made in USA stuff so I doubt they get cut.

But it's still a concern that did make me trim my position post election (plus being worried about earnings and just general profit taking); I'm actually a fan of their RRL line, it's really pricey, but the jeans are solid. I'm a denim nerd. Agree, I try to avoid retail, but kind of like $LRN, if the value is there for the stock, I'm really not opposed to it. 

It's actually down like 5% from it's peak in from a week ago. Still not sure if it's something I would own, but just love calling out stuff like this. It's had a solid year and even beating the SPY a tiny amount from the 5 year mark.; Sure as fuck feels that way but you know they will matter sometime soon; We can't share youtube links here, but it's a channel I like called S3.

The unrealized losses on BofA's bond portfolio are so high, it's almost half of their tangible equity (and growing as the 10-year yield keeps rising). They cannot cover these mark-to-market losses without ruining shareholder equity.

all the jobs and economic data has been cooked with outlier level positive seasonal adjustments. Those HAVE TO BE BALANCED by outlier level negative seasonal adjustments, and those will show a more true state of retail sales and job numbers.

FYI, that september blowout jobs report with the 220k job gains had the highest september seasonal adjustment factor ever. If you used the sept average adjustment over the past 20 years..... the report was a 200k job LOSS instead of gain.

Just wait imo; Another bubble bro who doesnt care about earnings or the fact that in the long run the market is driven by earnings.

Oh well.; I'm VERY sure you haven't done your research then :); the report has factually incorrect information all over the place. It also has a lot of speculation that MAY be true, but theres nothing concrete.

For example, they talk about Cerberus being loan sharks and how multiple companies they have owned have been destroyed. Those companies A, have a very different business model (a hopsital chain was their comp lmao) and B are owned by a different branch of Cereberus.

They act like CRB is trying to bankrupt EOSE and own the equity, when thats blatantly not true. In fact the ER 2 weeks ago showed EOSE missed a debt covenant, and cerebrus VOLUNTARILY WAIVED THE PENALTY for EOSE, indicating they are legit partners.

Theres more in it too that was BS. And to add to that, Icebern closed their puts right after the short report and closed their short. If they had conviction they should not just close their short immediately after the report. It was simply a smash and grab on a stock with >70 RSI that was overbought.; Of course it will. It always does. Risk reward is already way skewed to the downside. Insider selling at massive paces as retail inflow hits all time highs.

Investing in What You Know: Modern Tools for Finding Hidden Gems,"In 'One Up On Wall Street' (great book, highly recommend) Peter Lynch emphasizes the idea of ""investing in what you know"". Specifically, he talks about how some of his best investing ideas initially came from a friend or family member raving about a particular product:

>*""Taco Bell, I was impressed with the burrito on a trip to California; La Quinta Motor Inns, somebody at the rival Holiday Inn told me about it; Volvo, my family and friends drive this car; Apple Computer, my kids had one at home and then the systems manager bought several for the office; Service Corporation International, a Fidelity electronics analyst (who had nothing to do with funeral homes, so this wasn’t his field) found on a trip to Texas; Dunkin’ Donuts, I loved the coffee; and recently the revamped Pier 1 Imports, recommended by my wife. In fact, Carolyn is one of my best sources. She’s the one who discovered L’eggs.”*

According to Lynch, this is the key advantage retail investors have over Wall Street: spotting great products and brands in their daily lives, often long before they arrive on an Investment analyst's desk.

I'm wondering whether this process can be modernised, and expanded.

One challenge I face, for instance, is that I don’t live in the U.S., so the American products I notice are often already global, and likely already on Wall Street’s radar. This limits my ability to discover the kind of early opportunities Lynch described if I want to invest in American companies. 

Same goes for brands in Asia or Africa—surely there are great companies out there, future ten-baggers, but many of us won't come across simply because we're not exposed to their products, and by the time we are we've missed the boat.

I’m curious if people know of tools or methods to help identify these hidden gems. 

Perhaps something like an online product rating site or resource for finding universally loved brands that haven’t gone mainstream yet. I’ve thought about using tools like Amazon's “top rated” section, but reviews can be manipulated, and often it's just Chinese tat you can't invest in. I also checked out r/buyitforlife, but it’s not quite what I'm after.

Thoughts?

And please no ""put it all in VOO and come back in 80 years"". Yes most of my money is already in Index funds.

You realize analysts have daily lives too, right? He wasn't some random solo investor when he was running with these hunches, he was working for one of the largest investment companies in the world.

If you bothered to read the book rather than be a little know-it-all gimp on reddit he goes on to explain exactly why the big investment houses are often unable to invest in those companies, even if their analysts are aware of them.

>He's telling about his hunches that went well. How many didn't go so well

Plenty. But far more worked out than didn't, his track record was exemplary. And his point is to use is as a jump of point rather than the entire basis for investing. 

>Comparing the world of investing from 1977-1990 to the current day is just silly. 

Some things stand the test of time. Plenty of Graham and Dodd's writing is just as valid now as it was 80 years ago. I see no reason why Lynch's wouldn't be."
My mother asked me if I can help her with investing,"Im 20 years old and have been learning about investing for a solid 2-3 years now. My mother (37) sees and appreciates the work i’ve been putting in and asked me today for advice. 

“Should I invest with the bank or would you want to help me?”

I told her i’d help her. She doesn’t like much risk in any areas of her life so i’m thinking on focusing her portfolio on ETFs (VOO, SCHD) or simply just the S&P 500. 

Also thought about dividend paying companies (KO, O) or large caps like AAPL, MFST etc. 

Considering the bull market, a lot of non investors have been getting excited about the market recently. We’re at/near market ATH so I feel like I should tell her to hold off for a bit and wait for a dip but you can never time the market. 

What are your thoughts? Any advice would be much appreciated. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gw7a66/my_mother_asked_me_if_i_can_help_her_with/,14,"Buy her a copy of Simple Path to Wealth - and stay away from picking stocks for her.  If things go wrong, she needs to have made the decisions.; Zoom out for 30 years for the S&P500 and look at how many times the market has been at an all-time high, and how much bigger the all-time high was after 30 years.  

Trying to time the market is always dumb but it's particularly dumb when you're 37 and saving for retirement, because it literally doesn't matter as you can rest assured the market will have increased in 30 years, unless the world experiences some apocalyptic cataclysm we can't imagine.

At a minimum she should be maxing her IRA every year if possible, and she can just use a simple target date fund because IRAs are tax efficient so holding a fund that includes some bonds on it doesn't matter.

VOO is a good choice for a non-tax-advantaged account, although I'd rather have a whole stock market index fund like VTI.; Try also to teach her about market volatility. In case she checks her investments and panic sells or simply don't trust the process because she sees losses.

Because it will come years where the market is down **by a lot.**

I like using a [historical investment calculator](https://www.chooseinvesting.com/calc/historical-index-returns/) but even this won't highlight how bad it can actually be, only that the process will probably work given enough time.

And good you teach her instead of letting the banks picks investments for you because they will likely not choose a index fund that is probably the best long-term investment for most people.; At her young age (and yours), keep it simple 1) open an IRA/ROTH account at Fidelity, Schwab, or Vanguard, 2) put all the money into the highest date Target Date Fund offered and 3) add as much as budget and law allows every year and retire well off.; I'd personally dollar cost average into a low cost index fund like VOO (or SPLG if she can't buy partial shares/likes buying whole shares). With her time horizon SCHD doesn't make sense to me. Then flip to dividends in retirement. 

*This is just my two cents, not financial advice, all obvious disclaimers apply.; If your mother is risk adverse, then 100% stocks may not be appropriate. I would forget about investing in individual stocks also as that brings on even more risk. 

A globally diversified all cap exposed portfolio combined with a healthy bond allocation would be considered more moderate risk. Look into VT + BND or VTI + VXUS + BND. Better yet for a more hands off approach you could use a TDF in a tax advantaged account or one of Vanguard’s LifeStrategy funds if investing in a taxable account.; Investing? Can't, too busy eating cookies.; SPLG would be a great ETF for her.

You should not be heavily dividend investing at such a young age. You're leaving so much money on the sidelines when large cap growth is your best friend.; Time in the market beats timing the market. DCA’ing into an ETF is a fantastic strategy.; > She doesn’t like much risk in any areas of her life so i’m thinking on focusing her portfolio on ETFs

""I need a new car.  I'm thinking of focusing on Fords.""  Limiting your search to Fords does not address how safe a car is, or how easy it is to mount child seats, or give thought to its IIHS rating, or its gas mileage (""expense ratio""), or whether it can tow your trailer; you need to go deeper.

Likewise, simply being ""in ETFs"" does not make your investments ""low-risk"".  There are MANY indices, and even more FUNDS that track those indices, and passively managed funds have just as much volatility as the indexes that they follow.

You need to drill deeper to figure out what a ""not much risk"" portfolio really is.  (And putting all your investments in ONE SECTOR of the markets, ignoring Mid-Caps, ignoring Small-Caps, ignoring Vallue *vs.* Growth, ignoring International, ignoring Emerging Markets, ignoring bonds, isn't -my- definition of ""not much risk"".  Your opinion may be different.); blah blah blah. Put your mother into index funds. She is 37 and has long horizon.  Auto pilot. 

What do you know about all time highs and market dips at 20 ?  

What are you doing with your own money ?; I’m being blunt (sorry for that), but 1) you don’t even seem to know the basics about asset allocation and 2) you think that investing in stocks ETFs is for people that don’t like much risk, and 3) you’re asking for advice on reddit. 

You shouldn’t handle someone else’s money.

Google If You Can by William Bernstein and read it. It’s short and free.

If your mom is risk averse, you can use AOM, a moderate risk asset allocation ETF. It holds 40% bonds.; Dividends can be useful when someone needs more cash inflow. But your mother likely wants Reinvested Dividends (DRIP), not just the additional cash earnings. The dividends can be supplemental income, stashed towards other investment purchases, or let it automatically roll back into the same original investment kicking it out. That's instead of hoping for only share price growth. ; She can always hedge her bet by putting in 50% of her investments funds in now, and wait to see if there is a substantial drop.

If the market goes up, she’ll be happy with the gains, if it goes down, she can grab some bargains 😃; Well there are great ways to make far better then the market returns you referring to with these funds you mention. And I assume you going to suggest she buy and hold those holding as well. And don’t forget those dividend paying stocks that you’re the one that is paying yourself the dividend. I understand I have some great stocks that pay dividends. Wish they would not. It just makes a tax evened for me that I would rather control. NVDA pay a dividend, why. So on the day the dividend is paid my stocks value goes down by the exact amount of the dividend.; So many variables are missing. Is the investment in an IRA/Roth?  Brokerage account?  401K?

Does she have an emergency fund or access to a HELOC?

Dividends are taxed as income, as are short term capital gains... but long term capital gains can be tax gain harvested based on her income.

Depending on income, I would start with an IRA at Schwab/Fidelity.. and DCA into VTI or VOO while you work out a long term plan.

Plan should start with a budget, then a savings plan.. and then a long term plan for retirement (see boldin.com); I don't know where you live, but guide her to a low cost brokerage like Schwab, where they provide free financial advice and predetermined portfolios based on her risk profile. This would be a good start.; the answer is ""no""; Create a brokerage and an IRA for her and begin investing in BLK for both. She’s young enough to be putting money into a medium to higher risk ETF. It’s the largest fund manager in the world and they have exposure to everything, so the risk management is top tier. Shares run about $1040 right now.; many older people with index funds in there portfolios.  Often hear of a market crash panic and sell most of their  Locking in the loss. It happens all the time.  So I would eliminate VOO don't focus on growth for now..  Focus on Dividend funds or stocks with yields  of around 4 to 5%.  These would provide income which you mom needs most.  If she puts as much money as she can in dividends stocks she might get enough income from dividends to cover all of her living expenses.  Also emphasize pay off all debts.  Pay off the home and all credit cards.  In retirement t you want no debt.

SCHD is a good fund consider adding JEPI, PFFD, PBDC, and VYMI.  These three are very stable and have a higher dividend than SCHD.  I also have no problem with stocks like KO,  KHC, and T.  which all have     But AAPL and MFST are fairly old companies with high shar costs and low yields and don't grow like they did 20 years ago.   So I would avoid these because they will suck up a lot of your moms money and provide little benefit to her.; If it were me I'd have her buy 90% VTI and 10% VT; My mother taught me how to invest. She showed me the basics and explained in simple terms the various risks associated with each option. However, she always insisted that I choose the stock / bond / fixed term deposit / etc..  In other words, I have to own the risk.; Ok first off, she should be maxing out her 401K, IRA, or Roth. This will reduce her tax burden. 

Now she is relatively young so she needs to consider her time horizon. Any money put into individual stocks, she needs to be comfortable with those stocks potentially being cut in a third or maybe even half. If she invests in the S&P500 she needs to be willing to hold for maybe up to 10 years. The market will make her money, but only if she sticks it out. 

Some strategies I might consider for her are dividend growth, this will be made up of companies that are growing their dividend. It shows they can manage cash flow and are growing to where they feel comfortable increasing their payout. Other than that Dollar Cost Averaging into the market is my main go to. Lastly, if you or she has expertise in an individual area/industry, consider individual stocks. You can make a lot of money if you are good at picking them and if you know your market, whatever these froobs say, you can know things the “Smart Money” misses. 

Good luck. Let make some money!; 500 index until you hit 1M.; At ATH it is OK to start and hold off not putting all money available to use. All those stocks or etfs you mention are fairly expensive. Often I look for same funds at lower price and expense ratio using Swppx for SPY etc.

With the new adminstration coming on board favoring different and often radical policies, I have followed an interest sensitive philisophy focus by sectors. SPDR has a number of sector etfs.  The finance industry thrives when borrowing rate is lower. XL**F** consists of 74 **F**inancial insitutions. The return this year is +33.65%. Alternative energy may not be a good choice.  These etfs are simpler to manage than worrying about 7 different stocks.  Also they tend to beat the S&P which uses just 7 tech stocks to drive 85% of the momentum. All the best to you.; VOO; Great that your mom trusts you! VOO, SCHD, or solid dividend stocks like KO are perfect for low-risk. Don’t stress market timing dollar-cost averaging works well. Just ensure she has an emergency fund set aside first.; I'd recommend this. Investing for a family member is getting close to doing business with family, which I also recommend against. With the wrong family member, if anything goes wrong, it'll be your fault and you'll hear about it for years. Guiding them to resources where they can make their own smart decisions is what I go with, especially given that she's risk averse.

For example, O peaked at around $80 before the pandemic. It's now around $55. Even accounting for dividends, that's terrible performance, particularly compared to how the general market has soared in that same time.

"Qualcomm says it expects $4 billion in PC chip sales by 2029, as company gets traction beyond smartphones","Qualcomm said on Tuesday that it expects its push into new markets to generate an additional $22 billion per year by 2029.

Of that amount, roughly $4 billion will come from PC chips, Qualcomm said at its investor day on Tuesday. The chipmaker just introduced PC processors earlier this year, when it released Snapdragon X for Windows devices.

The latest forecast marks an important milestone for Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon, who took over the company in 2021 with a promise to get past a reliance on smartphones. In fiscal 2024, Qualcomm’s handset business reported $24.86 billion in sales, about 75% of its entire chip business.

Qualcomm also said on Tuesday that automotive revenues would rise about 175% by 2029 to $8 billion, of which 80% is tied to contracts that have already been secured.

*″*We have been on this trajectory realizing that the technologies we have developed over the many years can be very relevant to a number of different industries beyond mobile,” Amon said at the investor event.

Another $4 billion in revenue will come from industrial chips and $2 billion will come from chips for headsets, a category Qualcomm calls XR. About $4 billion of the forecast is a catch-all for other chip sales, like those for wireless headphones and tablets.

Qualcomm shares are up 16% this year, trailing the Nasdaq, which has gained 26%.

Qualcomm grew rapidly over the past decade as its modems and processors became essential parts for high-end smartphones, especially those running Google Android. Qualcomm also sells modems and related parts to Apple for its iPhones.

But the company has warned investors that Apple could choose to stop buying Qualcomm parts as soon as 2027. Qualcomm said on Tuesday that its growing businesses will more than offset any losses from Apple.

Qualcomm’s strategy under Amon has been to use the technology its developed for its handset chips, like modems, processors, and AI accelerators, in new markets, including cars, PCs, and virtual reality. The investor event was the first time in years that the company has given a forecast for those new markets. Qualcomm said its total addressable market is as large as $900 billion.

“We put a strategy in ’21, and we’re not changing our strategy,” Amon said.

Laptop and desktop chips are currently dominated by Intel, which has over 70% percent of the market, according to Mercury Research. Intel reported $29 billion in PC chip sales in its 2023.

“The competitive landscape changed between the Windows and Macs,” Amon said, referring to Apple’s move in 2020 to switch from Intel to its own processors. “We saw that as an opportunity, especially as the ecosystem did not have confidence in the existing players to actually deliver a solution.”

The forecast for XR headsets also hints at the growth potential of the VR market over the next five years. Qualcomm supplies chips to many of the top headset makers, including Meta for its Quest and Ray-Bans products.

When it comes to artificial intelligence, Qualcomm calls itself an “edge AI” company, in contrast to cloud-based AI that’s typically powered by Nvidia processors. Company officials didn’t rule out introducing data center products in an interview with CNBC.

Qualcomm suggested that its mobile chips will be able to run the kind of advanced AI that’s restricted to large server farms today, an indication that that company may benefit from the AI boom down the road as the technology becomes more efficient.

“What you can run on the cloud last year, you can run on the device this year,” Durga Malladi, Qualcomm’s senior vice president in charge of planning, said at the event.

Intel recently released ~~Arrow~~ Lunar Lake made Qualcomm computers irrelevant; Just driving a car also uses a lot of chips.; Working in a big project with partners that develop commercial engineering software and know their clients.

x86 is just a massive advantage just because of legacy, there are tons of code and binaries in use that are just critical and hard to port to another architecture. And translation layers are... Problematic.

So, on the pro side specially, AMD and Intel are on the winning team, and on the gaming side it seems similar.

Only the basic, web centric use case is where ARM can compete, something more akin to chromebooks and macbooks. But there, as architectures are easier to replace, RISC-V could boom too.

As I see it, ARM is under a bigger threat from RISC-V than x86 under ARM.; I dont think AMD has that level of market power to stop Qualcomm. They will definitely hit 4B in chip sales by then. X Elite is already solid and next gen will have big improvements as they move from N4 to N3(P). We already see 8 Elite showing big improvement from X Elite. 

I expect app compatibility to improve big time as well as adoption increases.; AMD has arm chips??; In what magical manner is this bullsih for Intel, you think that rev will come from new markets? Not likely. Trying to eat at the Intel/AMD duopoly.; great insight professor; Their smartphone processors had no reason to be   competitive because buyers weren't choosing them based on performance, they needed a cellular capable SoC and Qualcomm's patents make it the only practical choice on the cellular side so customers had to buy whatever CPU Qualcomm wanted to bundle with it.  

The only company with the unit volume and pricing power to pay Qualcomm separately for the cellular capability and a different CPU/GPU is Apple.; Doubt. ; > Intel recently released Arrow Lake

I think you mean Lunar Lake.; Neither Lunar Lake nor Arrow Lake is selling all that well. Intel even admitted that Lunar Lake is more of a niche product with terrible margins compared to Snapdragon X Elite that has been a broadly launched product in the market.


Snapdragon X Elite is fine and developers can use it to further optimise their code for successors that will be released on a regular basis.; Yea well both new processors by Intel and AMD perform better across the board while consuming less power and having no restrictions on what apps you can or cant use, so theres ARM for ya.; He's probably talking about the rumor that QCOM may buy INTC.; No insight needed… their genuinely shit.; Legacy compatibility of code is just a massive factor.

ARM is under a bigger threat by RISC-V where code compatibility is not an issue, if we're talking about architecture comparisons.

x86 is more than safe, and a winning bet especially in professional workloads and gaming.; Wheres the link chief?; Intel has fallen behind and they will soon be eliminated.; Writing off Qualcomm after their first gen implementation seems foolish.

Is it possible that Tariffs could be good,"Don’t want to get into politics in this discussion. But could tariffs actually be a good thing for a bunch of US companies?

Is there a way to structure tariffs to help domestic companies? 

People say the US gets hit by tariffs or sanctions by other countries. Wouldn’t it make sense to even the playing field? 

I’m seeing Apple has to pay a huge ‘tariff’ to sell phones in Indonesia now. Yet I doubt goods from Indonesia get charged a tariff in the US. 

Could tariffs be imposed based on the tariffs the US faces from that country? Wouldn’t it make sense if China imposes a 10% tariff on US goods that the US do the same?",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gv3778/is_it_possible_that_tariffs_could_be_good/,0,"They can be. But they need to be very well targeted, and you need to have a lot of confidence that American manufacturers can pick up the slack, and that you are prepared for the political retribution by the tariffed country. 

Otherwise it just raises prices.; Tariffs placed on specific products to protect domestic “infant industries” can be beneficial. These allow the domestic companies a chance to establish themselves in the market without overwhelming competition from overseas. A good example of this is electric vehicles- there are tariffs on EVs from China where they are made with very low costs already.

The proposed blanket tariffs on all products imported have little to no upside. Other countries will put tariffs on our exports in retaliation and hurt even our domestic industries. Read up on the Smoot-Hawley tariffs that worsened the Great Depression.; A 3 sec google search shows that consumers pay the tarrif on iPhones in Indonesia and that Iphones are more expensive there than the US.; If there was no political blowback (trade war) and we had an already developed domestic production base for the products? Maybe.


A good example of a surface level negative effect is that Trumps administration wants to gut our green energy subsidies across the board. This will lead to higher prices, less innovation, less investment, ect. in the sector. If he then puts tariffs on foreign products used for green energy, batteries and solar panels for example, the space will quickly become impossibly expensive.


I'm not an economist and could be dead wrong on all of this but overall this seems like an extremely half baked plan over all.; Biggest problem with tariffs is that the other country gets a vote.  They tend to apply reciprocal tariffs that limit the ability of US companies to sell into their markets and both sides have less economic output.

Blanket, across the board tariffs are particularly harmful.  Targeted tariffs on specific countries and industries that are not trading fairly can be effective in leveling the playing field but even in those cases, the net result is usually higher prices.; It depends on your definition of ‘good’.

It will always harm US consumers in the short term and there isn’t any way around it.

There are times when a piece of the supply chain has a negative externality on the country, often ‘national security’.

Say if by the free market our microchips were made solely in a country that is increasingly at risk of becoming adversarial, and our military and economy relies on those microchips.

The immediate effect is that tariff will raise prices for consumers, which makes the venture profitable for an American company to start getting into the business of creating microchips in America. Previously they wouldn’t have been able to compete with the foreign company’s low prices because of their low labor costs. Now with the tariff it’s competitive. Over time domestic production capacity will grow and prices will come back down some but unlikely to the point it was at before. However this could be worth it for Americans if the national security problem is now solved. 

However, if the country we tariffed imports one of our exports, they will retaliate in kind so as to discourage any future tariffs. And whatever industry they choose to tariff will suffer in America as that company loses out on those sales just as we did to the foreign company. Which country gets hurt more depends on the trade balance, who depends most on who. In the case of the Trump vs China trade war, we depended more on China, and we decisively lost that trade war, at least from an economic standpoint. 

But again, all this damage might be worth it if the national security concern is resolved.

Though there are much better ways to achieve our desired outcome and address the national security concern, like by subsidizing US development of microchips, like we did in the bipartisan CHIPS act.

There’s also a hidden long term effect of tariffs, if foreign companies know that tariffs are a risk they are less likely to seek investing in the US market in the first place. 

As far as universal non-strategic tariffs go, no, there is never a chance those would be good in any way. And fortunately our future president knows this and will not actually implement the policy, just as he promised and did not do the last time. Trump is a right wing populist who has no moral objects to lying, and says popular policies he will never implement because they are bad policies. And presidents and parties are judged based on how the economy actually does, not by implementing what people think will help the economy.; Tariffs = more trade wars = good for nobody.

The biggest issue is governments making up the rules as they go along, which is terrible for business.; There's two different ""good"" outcomes here. 

Can tariffs be good for the consumer? Almost never. A tarriff is just a tax that the consumer ends up paying. 

Can tariffs be good for US companies? Yes, and especially newer emerging fields. But it can also harm plenty of companies by making their raw materials more expensive to import.; Every government intrusion into the economy produces winners and losers, so yes, tariffs will be a good thing *for certain US companies*.  It will almost certainly be a bad thing for a larger number of companies and for the economy as a whole.

Regarding your other stuff: just because your neighbors shoot themselves in the foot, that doesn't mean it's a good thing for you to shoot yourself in the foot in response.; That can be possible, but tariffs must be balanced and strategically imposed. Plus, imposing tariffs on a tit-for-tat basis could potentially lead into a trade war and that's not the most sensible thing to do unless there's a strategic approach that defends specific industries; the way that things work right now, we end up shipping items back and forth a lot between countries for different forms of processing. so we might have raw materials that are sent to china so their laborers can process it and then send it back so our machines can finish the job. tariffs generally just disrupt that ecosystem and make things worse. they can play a part in ""protecting"" us businesses, but they do so in the form of increasing the costs to consumers for foreign goods, so prices go up, rather than subsidizing industry, which would permit prices to fall or stay the same while promoting localized production; Tariffs would be good for any of Temu’s competitors; Only time theyre useful is where there is an industry inside the physical domain of your country that you feel is essential to keep within your boarders. These are typically things like growing food, critical technologies like for national security, etc. 

If you rely on another nation for all of your car manufacturing and suddenly youre at war with them, well then you cant make cars now. If you i port all of your food and you get embargoed, your people starve since you dont have domestic production.

If you cannot produce steel domestically, come wartime youll find it hard to make ships and planes and tanks and such.

Tarrifs are a strategic policy that forces distortions into the free market to artificially prop up the economic competitiveness (in your home market) of a domestic industry compared to foreign nations with higher comparative advantage at that industry.; ""Is there a way to structure tariffs to help domestic companies?""

The point of tariffs is to help domestic companies.  It's why many countries in 2024 have them, to help their domestic companies.  It's also why many countries have used them for hundreds of years.; As proposed. No.  A balnket tarrif on imports will do nothing but skyrocket inflation.

In theory using tariffss as a scapel to target ONLY industries that HAVE US manufacturing and who are economic enough that the tariff puts them over the top ... maybe.  Even economimsts don't agree so it isn't a slam dunk.  

The nonsense currently proposed is both moronic and harmful.; Consumers would ultimately pay higher prices, but the extra dollars spent would stay in the US and have a potentially stimulating effect on the economy. There could be downstream impacts if components, supplies, and raw materials had proportional tariffs, so US producers also source raw materials from other US producers. This is possible in the US because we have/can have a fairly complete domestic supply chain unlike other/smaller countries.; Doesn't matter. Companies are so greedy now they are going to raise prices to continue their record profits whether its the current structure or another one. Until something is done about it (nothing will be done) then consumers are going to continue to struggle to pay for everyday goods to live.; [removed]; Tariffs are inflationary.   One example I like to give:  Let's say you're shopping for a new washing machine.  You can buy a 1000$ Samsung or an 1100$ Whirpool.  The Samsung washer is the obvious choice, and you save $100.  Suppose Trump dictates a 50% tariff on Samsung products while sitting on his gold-plated toilet.  So now Samsung's washer is $1500.  Buy the Whirlpool at $1100, right?  Ok, but that's already $100 you're paying for a new washer.  But wait, there's more!  Now that Whirlpool's competition has an artificially inflated price due to a tariff, their new price becomes $1400.  So now your new washer costs you another $400 due to a tariff you may or may not have been duped into voting for.  Enjoy inflation, everyone!   Let's all pay more for everything and never retire.  It's the new American dream.; We put up tariffs on everything, even for products or industries that we're not producing here or trying to protect, prices go up. The other country then implements retaliatory tariffs on our stuff, reducing our own exports and hurting domestic business. 

Both of these would trigger price increases for products we buy. Even if we start aggressively manufacturing products that we currently import, what's the incentive for domestic businesses to sell at reasonable prices? If the only other source of products in a sector are from overseas and require a big tariff, domestic businesses will just sell their domestic version at the same price or maybe just slightly under the inflated import product. 

At nearly every level in the chain, it causes inflationary increases across the board. It only ever makes sense when we're trying to actually protect a specific industry from cheap outside goods. Although at this point, the whole idea of EV tariffs are pissing me off, when we have companies like Xiaomi dropping what looks to be an incredible car that we simply can't buy because daddy Musk needs his inferior car company propped up.; Tariffs can help create and maintain companies and industries that produce products in the US.; Hmm... they could raise tariffs on H1B visas and promote educating necessary skills within the US instead of pilfering brains from other countries. 

Or better yet, let H1B be a 1-year citizenship pathway. ; \> Is it possible that Tariffs could be good

Is it possible? Sure but unlikely. There might be some unintended 2nd order consequence. ex> FOO becomes expensive in the US, so we develop a FOO industry and become a market leader in FOO in 10 years.

Is it likely? No - see all the other comments.

\> The threat of tariffs

The more likely source of a positive outcome is from the threat of tariffs. We use this threat constantly already. These don't disrupt markets as negatively. There might be some quick wins if someone more aggressive directed these.

Some countries are violating agreements and/or taking advantage of us. If someone ran on a platform correcting those - I would support that. Is this the best mechanism to correct those? Probably not. But it is reasonable to try.

But this isn't a long term/sustainable/scalable solution. You can't aggressively threaten allies. 

\* Not a Trump supporter - disclaimer.; If by good you mean, placing the monetary burden of pollution for jumbo cargo ships going across the ocean on the people actually causing it, Yes, absolutely.

Taxes are perfectly cromulent when there are negative externalities involved, I can think of few things contributing more co2 than activities involved with importers busy importing.

Environmentally, yes, absolutely they are Good.

Tariffs are far easier to justify on the basis of pollution than income taxes, which is a tax on work, which is what productivity comes from, which is a positive externality.

>The tariff has been used as a political tool to establish an independent nation; for example, the United States [Tariff Act of 1789](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff_Act_of_1789), signed specifically on July 4, was called the ""Second Declaration of Independence"" by newspapers because it was intended to be the economic means to achieve the political goal of a sovereign and independent United States.

I am a holder of USD as an unfortunate consequence of being a serious investor, anything that takes USD out of circulation (taxes) is okay in my book, taxes are how my holdings hold real value at all, the more the better.  I need a hard deflation, fast, to compensate the risk I've been taking holding excess USD, which I believe we are close to.; Tariffs not bad, maybe?; Everyone is freaking out over rumors. It won't be as bad as everyone thinks. 1. Trump proposed a LOT of things in his first term and didn't really follow through or accomplish most of them. 2. Elon understands business and has Trump's ear. Tariffs will hurt Tesla, Apple, and any other US company with manufacturing in China. He'll advise Trump not to do anything too crazy that harms these companies too much.; And if we can predict anything about the trump admin implementation, it's that it'll be anything but deliberate, well-researched, and targeted.; I mean way back in the day they were good but with our current situation they will never be good. Tariffs promote making products within the country. When the country’s wages are so much higher than the tariffed country you will be paying more regardless.; Or other SE Asian countries interested in manufacturing like Vietnam. The Chinese aren't honest partners.; https://youtu.be/uhiCFdWeQfA?si=aoEQWAYC2us_xnTn; We would never know 100% for sure but I've seen some CNBC claims that there aren't many state subsidies on Chinese EVs nowadays and the low costs are mainly labor costs. Aside from labor costs the Chinese companies are just outcompeting US companies in general around the world (outside the US). I worry that these tariffs (which will indeed help Elon Musk) will only make American automaters more complacent and innovate less. Just look at the POS that is the cybertruck.; How dare you to fact check?!?; That doesn’t answer the question. It is still effectively a tariff against Apple. Yes the customer pays it. But that means Apple either has to lower its price or take less profit to sell the same amount of phones. Bottom line is the extra $200 the customer pays goes to the government instead of Apple. So Apple is basically paying the tax. Does the USA charge tariffs on Indonesian goods? If not how is that fair?; What does that have to do with anythjng? I don't think Indonesia can manufacture a comparable smart phone; My main issue with this is that, because of how much higher US wages are, the made in USA product will always cost more. So even if you tariff the product, the consumer will still be paying more on average.

And knowing the history of this country, the second the majority of people switch to the USA made product, the company will raise the price…; Worse the proposed tarriff is simply everything.  Every single import from everywhere. That is going to do nothhing but raise prices across the board.  Then every country in the world is going to respond with punitive tarriffs killing US exports too.

It is almost like that dimwit ""learned"" what a tarriff is this year and now thinks it is some automatic win cheat card.; Maybe. Depends which country has leverage. Or it could simply be used (threat of a tariff) as a negotiating tactic; >The immediate effect is that tariff will raise prices for consumers, which makes the venture profitable for an American company to start getting into the business of creating microchips in America. Previously they wouldn’t have been able to compete with the foreign company’s low prices because of their low labor costs. Now with the tariff it’s competitive. Over time domestic production capacity will grow and prices will come back down some but unlikely to the point it was at before. However this could be worth it for Americans if the national security problem is now solved.


I would add that if the industry doesn't ALREADY exist in the US and isn't ALREADY at least marginally competitive nobody is going to be stupid enough to build a chip fab in the US because of this.

Buidling a fab takes 4-6 years and the break even on the tens of billion in capital involved takes another good decade.  The tariffs will be long gone before that leaving the company with a multi-billion dollar non-competitive milstone around their neck.

Companies just do not make billion dollar decisions based on an idiotic plan someone wrote down on a napkin.

Step 1) Put Tarriff on everything

Step 2) ???

Step 3) Profit; Bourbon Tariffs help the Scotch industry in the EU and UK. Bourbon was too expensive that people basically stopped buying US whiskey in the EU and bought more Scotch and Irish whiskey; How good for the consumer LONG TERM? If there are zero tariffs and the US can’t compete then tens of millions will lose their jobs. This isn’t theoretical. It has already happened. And it will happen more if the playing field isn’t leveled.

For example if there was no tariffs on Chinese EV. Literally the US manufacturers will get absolutely destroyed. Sure the ‘consumer’ can get a cheaper car. But in the long term it will be bad because the lost of jobs and GDP.; So you are fine with removing tariffs on Chinese EVs? That would literally destroy the US car business. Chinese can sell the same quality car for half the price of American made. There is no way these companies survive.

You are looking purely at the consumer side. But many consumers have jobs. If Samsung dominates then Whirpool employees will lose their jobs. Their communities will suffer and GDP will suffer. You can’t just look at things myopically. 

Sure in the short term buying US products could cost more. But in the LONG TERM it will boost the US economy and will be better for everyone. A country that has to import everything will be in deep crap eventually; But the EV tariffs do help tens of thousands of Tesla employees and many stock investors. All those jobs also boost the local economy. Without those tariffs Tesla would get obliterated. Heck even non electric car brands would get obliterated. Chinese EV’s are literally half the price of US made ones. There is no way too compete. A nice Chinese EV is only $30k and to get an equivalent American car (EV or ICE) will cost $60k.; ... at the consumers expense.; Or move production to another cheap country not under tariffs.; Huh? If the US removes the tariffs on Chinese EVs it would be a disaster for Tesla. They can make comparable cars for half the price; If I was trump’s advisors, I would literally just enact like one extra small tarrif on one specific thing and then ride out the growing Biden economy. That way you get a good economy with saying you did tariffs.

Its problably not stupid enough to happen.; Many in his last administration have pointed out that he likes to make last minute decisions based on who ever spoke to him last.  He also refuses to read briefing materials and spends most of his time watching fox news.; Agreed. I would only use tariffs for national security related supply chains which makes costs somewhat moot. 

For consumer products, it's just a bad deal for everyone.; Many things are still made in the US.; Nailed it; Chinese EVs are cheaper because of Labor costs, easier regulation and their executives don’t make billions in compensation; USA can't either that's why they make everything abroad.; Neither can the US.   

A tarffif can only even have the possibility of helping IF
1) a US industry exists to protect
2) the US industry is at least competitive enough that the tariff provides enough of a competitive advantage that demand is insourced
3) the affected country doesn't slap an even more harmful tarriff on US goods in respone.

Managing all three requires laser precision and flexibility and even then the results aren't guaranteed to be good.  Slapping a tarriff on all imports is just moronic and will hurt US consumers.; I think they edited their post.

I'm pretty sure it originally didn't have the “in the US” part in the Indonesia section.; No way he does a tariff on everything. But he will use it as a threat in negotiations. Trump is running the government like a business; not what i said, i feel like that damage has been done and we gotta prolly deal w those another way. i think a lot of the car industry has been burdened by regulations, so i'd be more likely to support subsidies in an effort to counteract those, but im not sure.; That is something my coworkers and I have had a couple conversations about and I just don't know. I don't know that there is a solution really. Only way it changes is the prices outweigh the perceived value of the item and consumers just stop buying all together. As quality continues to go down, quantity continues to go down, but prices continue to go up I just wonder where the breaking point is.; That's true only if the tariffs are permanent.  So far that doesn't appear to be the trend; Consumers are also employees. Without tariffs tens of thousands would be lost at Tesla.; ...Well, really, the importers expense that is who is taking the risk, if the consumer can't afford it or buys an alternative or goes without altogether as a matter of preference, the importer is left holding that bag.

Taxes are perfectly cromulent when negative externalities are involved, pollution is one of them, and importers busy importing contribute a ton of co2.

So if people are serious about combating climate change, and hitting climate goals, we need drastically higher tariffs.; A certain dunce has proposed a blanket tarriff on all imports from all countries because he is dumb enough to think it is just free money and nobody in the Republican party can tell him that he is a moron.; Growing biden economy.... lol; Many? You mean the people he fired because of incompetence. Can you name 1 guy who said these things that wasn’t fired by Trump?; Yes but there is a massive wage disparity now causing the prices to be vastly different and most people can’t afford the made in usa product; They are already building Macs in the USA. Over the long term they could build iPhones in the USA with proper training and government regulations; If its so difficult how come other countries have effectively placed tariffs on US goods? You make it sound like brain surgery. It’s also a powerful negotiation tool. If the USA never imposes tariffs then other countries will take advantage of the US.

And guess what? The EU is already putting what is effectively tariffs on big US companies like Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon. It might not be called tariffs but massive fines and regulations that only effect US megacaps are effectively tariffs; Maybe in the short term. However, this opens the opportunity for competitors to grow. If china is underpaying it's workers, stealing IP and working in unsafe environments, the US will never be able to compete. Tariffs  over time this could encourage migration to similarly minded economies benefiting the workers, consumers and discouraging unfair businesses tactics.; Well starting the tariff is the only way it has a chance to be permanent. The USA in the last 50 years has done a terrible job protecting many of its domestic industries; Right, but a very very small fraction of those consumers are employees that will be getting wage increases due to tariffs. That means majority of consumers will just get an expense increase and less money at the end of every month.; what are some goods that consumers would have to buy that would be affected by the tariffs? could farming equipment become much more expensive making food cost more?; lol, you sound like a 12 yo.; It is objectively doing well and growing by data and economic standards.

His turnover rate was over 80%.; People still buy Tesla. Alot of Tesla.

Other great domestic products: Red Wings, Bourbon, Lodge cask iron, American Toyotas, Weber grills. Even with higher labor costs it can be done with some government help.; > They are already building Macs in the USA.

just the Mac Pro and it's been done since 2013. there's no way Apple is going to be able to build their latest tech in the USA anytime soon. even with incentives it would still prob be cheaper building the tech overseas.; They largely don't.  Certainly not blanket idiotic tarriffs because if they did we would slap a reciprocal tariff and both sides would be hurt.; No it won't because no company is going to make business deciions on a idiotic proposal like this which won't last more than four years.  The break even time on a new semiconductor plant for example is around 12 to 15 years.

Also the proposed tariff is not just on China it is a tarriff on all imported goods from all countries with zero exceptions.; Think long term. Today its car companies. Tomorrow its another industry that will lose hundreds of thousands of jobs. You don’t do anything and eventually there won’t be any jobs left.; The tarrif proposed is on everything.  Litterally every import from every country in the world.  So it would directly and indirectly affect the price of every goods and services every single consumer spend money on.; Probably mostly everything if I had to guess with how interconnected everything is.

We're all guilty of contributing to climate change, therefore, one way or another, we all gotta pay.; Stock market does not equal main street; So basically all these people have an axe to grind. Not really unbiased; None of us are saying it’s going to be a blanket increase on prices lol

There are some things that won’t be affected but a ton of it will; Cheaper initially. But think 30 years from now. It is possible to build phones here with government incentives. I’m not proposing they should. I’m just saying the US does have the land, assets and technology to do so; No one is saying blanket tariffs are good. We are saying targeted tariffs can be effective. No one seriously thinks Trump will actually tariff everything. He might use it as a threat for negotiations; Were not talking about a specific proposal let alone specifics of a specific proposal. So anyway..; That's some fear mongering you're believing. There will always be jobs in America. We do our own exporting to other countries, which requires US citizens working those jobs. Importing and exporting is beneficial to all countries involved.

If you look into it more, immigrants tend to work jobs that Americans do not want to work. There is data on this, not speculation. The only way to make those jobs enticing enough for someone to suffer through it is to increase the pay massively... and the businesses are not going to eat that cost either. That will be shifted to consumers too. This business raises cost which raises cost for these other three businesses so those three raise cost, etc. It's a domino effect all because you want to keep a job in America that nobody in our living standards wants to do.; Trump is using that only as a threat. He ain’t going to tariff EVERYTHING. He will use this as a negotiating tactic to get better trade deals or get tariffs removed from US goods; > But, it is the right thing to do.

what do you mean by this? because i think it's a net negative and not beneficial to Americans.; Or - hear me out here - because its going to require long and complex thought: if almost everyone who has worked with him over the last few decades, says that he's shit. Then perhaps he is in fact: shit.; You said people can’t afford US goods. My answer is yes American companies can compete. I gave you many examples. If the government protects US companies from unfair competition they can be successful. Unfair competition like China giving their domestic companies huge subsidies to drop prices; >No one seriously thinks Trump will actually tariff everything.

JFC 8 years of this shit.  Trump says X. Morons like you ""Trump doesn't really mean X.  I personally having never even met Trump know me means Y.""  Later Trump does X.  Morons like you <pikachu face>.; Fear mongering? Tell that to the millions who lost jobs when they got laid off because manufacturing moved overseas; I think we all benefit from breathing clean air, no?

The fuels these jumbo cargo ships use is the cheapest nastiest garbage you could possibly get away with burning.

This imposes a cost on everyone that goes uncompensated for.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality)

Ideally, you want to tax things with negative externalities, and subsidize those with positive externalities.

[https://oecdstatistics.blog/2023/06/15/new-estimates-provide-insights-on-co2-emissions-from-global-shipping/](https://oecdstatistics.blog/2023/06/15/new-estimates-provide-insights-on-co2-emissions-from-global-shipping/); Exactly! These cultists are so oblivious. The most hardline conservative generals called this old con a FASCIST and told Americans not to vote for him. But because rational people in this country and drowned out by a majority of idiots, here we are. These poor simpletons truly believe that Trump is a deity and will continue to as he pillages the country. Pathetic.; And yet he is a multi billionaire. He must know something about running a business.; Trump said he was going to do massive tariffs in his previous term. It never happened. He is using it as a threat and negotiating tactic; And you think literally all jobs in the US will do the same? Wrong. You think even a quarter of the jobs? Wrong. That's my point. Does what you describe happen? Of course, but that benefits majority of the citizens in the US.; all the hazards and chemicals needed for manufacturing will be moved from other countries to the USA. the water and air quality might get even worse. EPA has already been gutted and many companies have been polluting for decades and get away with minor fines so this will get even worse.; Who's bankrupted himself 6 times, has been involved in thousands of court cases and famously fleeces contractors.

It he bankrupts a casino, people lose their jobs. If he bankrupts the usa, people die. Lots of people die.

Running a country isn't anything like running a business. Not even close.; Trump did do massive tarriffs in his first term although not as dumb as a blanket tarriff.  China responded with punitive tarriffs on US argriculture exports and the US government had to keep farmers from going bankrupt.  Almost like only idiots think tariffs are free money.  

Chinese consumers were hurt by higher prices and American agriculture lost billions.  The big winner was Brazil who signed a bilateral trade agreement with China to supply soybeans and US soybean production has still not recovered fully.; With the rise of AI it could easily lead to 25% of Americas losing their jobs to overseas. Auto industry, chemical, food, computer chips, ect could all be lost without protections from the government; >the water and air quality might get even worse

That is the cost of doing the pollution; I don't know if you've ever done any traveling, but why should the Chinese in Beijing be choking on thick grey sulfur reeking air?  Why should the globe then suffer from the additional pollution associated with carting this junk across the ocean?  We really do have only one atmosphere that we all share.

It is honestly madness that you really can't imagine without seeing it with your own eyes (you can literally stare at the sun with no problem in Beijing it just hangs like a faintly glowing red orb in the stone grey sky), that should be put to a stop, somehow.

If we want to pollute, we should be the ones to bear the burden, it is the right thing to do, we are the best equipped to handle it and deal with it appropriately.

There isn't anywhere else that isn't suffering from brain drain and the ensuing growth of poverty from us doing the immigration at all.

As much of a huge fan of Dr. Milton Friedman I am, I might have to concede there are things he could be wrong about, we might need tariffs to stop climate change, and we might need to stop immigration in totality (legal and otherwise) to hopefully stop destabilizing everywhere expanding poverty endlessly.

Cheap goods are nice, but, there is a tradeoff.  Our main import is brains, our main export is pollution, an unintended consequence of the combination are not great for those not in The US.; He has dozens of companies. Its business. Sometimes the best option is to file for bankruptcy.; Show me the proof of damage to US industry 

Cost of food went up 15% in one year not because of tariffs; If your assumption is true, which I highly think is grossly exaggerated since AI is nowhere close where you're thinking it is, then that's when specific tariffs get put into place, not the tariffs that's being proposed. Country wide tariffs are never the answer, ever.

And even then you're still raising costs for all consumers."
Should I change my investment mix?,"I currently have about $35k in an HYSA @4.1%
About 21k in investments, about $7k of which is ETFs, rest are crypto($5k) and individual stocks. Some like META, JPM, APPL etc and some terrible penny stock picks. 

I think I should restart investing in VTI, but probably wait a couple months for market correction?

Also, I have about $282k mortgage (7%) should I instead dump my savings towards my mortgage ?
I do have some money set aside in checkings in the meantime 

Edit - M 27, 7% mortgage rate",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gupo84/should_i_change_my_investment_mix/,2,"Finance major here, I would only consider placing savings into your mortgage if it was a higher interest rate than you’re comfortable with paying. As for the HYSA you don’t need to save so much unless you genuinely have $35k in expenses over 6 months if you were to lose your job tomorrow.

I would consolidate the portfolio to make it super simple (no more than 3-5 stocks/funds and then make sure you have things setup in a Roth IRA or 401k so you’re getting tax benefits as well.

If you’re burning money in penny stocks, go ahead and cut the losses. Nobody got rich by giving away money.; Not really enough information. Age. Interest rate. Returns. 

I would compare returns to SPY and then if you are not beating it just be it. 

I can say I invest in SPY and QQM mostly. I switch the mix on how I see and feel the market.; it seems like your investment mix could use some adjustments. waiting for a market correction before investing in vti could make sense, but timing the market is risky. if you believe in the long-term growth of vti, dollar-cost averaging might be a better approach to reduce risk over time. as for crypto and penny stocks, they’re high risk; maybe consider reallocating some of those funds into diversified etfs like vti or voo for stability.

regarding your mortgage, it depends on the interest rate. if your mortgage rate is low (below 4-5%), it might make more sense to keep investing rather than paying it down, as market returns could outpace your mortgage rate. however, if the peace of mind from paying off debt matters more to you, allocating some savings toward the mortgage isn’t a bad move. just ensure you maintain an emergency fund in case of unexpected expenses.; Do you live in a state with no state tax?; nah, stick with ur current mix bro; Nah, stick with ur current mix.; nah, stick with ur current mix.; Nah stick with your current mix man 👨 I AM NOT A BOT; 
My Mortgage interest is 7%. I can make do, but more equity is always preferred, right? 

So suggesting move the HYSA to something like maybe VTI or SPY ?

Those penny stocks are already gone, nothing left worthwhile to cut losses. 
I may consolidate into limited blue chip stocks though!  
Thank you for toy analysis and feedback!; Crypto, I have BTC and ETC. I think I can handle that risk appetite. Penny stocks is something I am already burnt on. If I sell, best I get is the loss. Ao that doesn’t really affect a whole lot. I already consider all of that as gone. 

Guess I will wait a little bit to add more to VTI or SPY. 

My mortgage is 7%. Unfortunately, there’s no knowing when and if I will be able to refi. I do have an emergency fund for 6 month in a separate checking account. Everything in HYSA is just that. Savings. I am conflicted if I should be leaving this there or move it to mortgage. Mortgage payment might reduce about 5 years of my mortgage. 

Another option I just thought -should I buy down points and look for a 4% mortgage?; Yes!; bots are out of control; I would consider analyzing a 6 month expense report for your current household and then setting that as your target savings. Keep in mind your HYSA will need to be calculated using Real Rate and not just whatever it’s offering. So if it’s 4% and inflation is 4% as well (CPI data for research) then you’d need to adjust.

Keep SPY or VOO (not financial advice) in an investment vehicle that can provide the best tax benefits. Don’t be the person who holds it in an individual brokerage account and then loses 40% of it 30 years later due to taxation.; Ok, I was gonna suggest tbills as they don't have state tax but if you are already living in a state with no state tax you don't have to go that route.; How would you lose 40% of it 30 years down the road?; What types of investment vehicles?; Taxes. They’re saying use tax deferred accounts first. I max mine before even thinking about personal brokerage"
QUESTION: Warren Buffet annualized returns without Apple?,"warren buffet has an average annualized ~20% return for over the last 5 decades. BUT what would be his adjusted average returns if he never invested in apple? I’m curious to know how key apple was to his success. 

I have been trying to google all morning for this, but google’s search engine only shows recent articles about how warren buffet has dropped apple from his portfolio. I’m sure there’s a study or article somewhere that’s done the math? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gu76al/question_warren_buffet_annualized_returns_without/,98,"While Berkshire's long-term performance has been stellar, there's evidence of underperformance in more recent years:

From 1965 to 2002 (a 38-year period), Berkshire's compounded annual return was 25.66% compared to the S&P 500's 10.02%.

However, from 2003 to 2022 (a 20-year period), Berkshire slightly underperformed the S&P 500, delivering a 9.75% compounded annual return compared to the S&P 500's 9.80%.

I believe AAPL was added in 2016.

Can't add my source for this due to domain - search ""Warren Buffett Has Underperformed the Stock Market for the Last 20 Years
Rishit Jain
BumpedIn / ISB / CFA
Published Apr 27, 2023""; It’s important to note, because I feel like this is kind of an attempt to discredit him, that managing other people’s assets needs to take a more conservative approach than just yolo-ing the clients’ money into the S&P 500.; Always remember that Berkshires portfolio has grown far too large for Warren to make positions in companies he would love to make , he has stated this many times for years , they are restricted to mostly big blue chips . Also I think warrens approach to Berkshire evolved from beating the sp500 to being a great steward of other people’s money .; I don't get it. Why not search what he would've annualized if you picked out his worst investment? Such a useless hypothetical. What's in the portfolio, is in the portfolio.; This is silly

You can’t just throw out one of his most successful stock picks; Were Buffett and Munger really ever as good as they were touted to be or were they just products of opportunity to begin with? Anyone who started investing when they did would have had the opportunity to buy all these blue chips in their absolute infancy and realize 1000+% gains when hardly anything in the world existed. They lived through the golden age of invention and capitalism.; Impossible to tell: If not AAPL it would have been another (likely great) company they would have put their money into...  It would not have been treasury bonds.  But still, I get your question.... It's hard to know exactly because it looks like they bought and sold AAPL multiple times...; He just acquired Apple recently considering this is over 50 years. I don’t think Apple would account for half of the gains. My guess is 15%; [deleted]; Warren Buffet doesn’t make any picks.  It’s not 1990; He makes like $750 Million a year in Coca Cola dividends alone; It doesn’t matter because if he hadn’t invested in Apple, he would have invested in something else. What if he had done something that’s performed better than Apple?; Keep in mind he's been something like 20%ish bonds as well. In theory, they should potentially be compared to an  80/20 portfolio.; Mr. Buffett and Munger did a fantastic job when Berkshire was a relatively smaller large cap.  At the start of 2003 it had a market cap of $104 billion.  The law of large numbers started to kick then for a modestly growing company.  It is remarkable that with it's huge size, Berkshire has been able to be so close to the S&P 500 since 2003.  But if you are looking for future outperformance, you need to look elsewhere.; gotcha. thank for the search term, interesting read.; He sold off TSMC in mid-2023, when it was around $90-100. So, fact that he sells, doesn't mean, it's a dud stock. I'd still hold onto Apple. 

He bought ULTA in mid-2024, around $400. It's been meh-stock so far. Frankly, he's losing it.; Cherry picking tech bottom


If you use when bro bottom in 2000... Then it's 10.7 for brk and 7.7 for spy....; Yeah and the funds goal may not even be beating the S&P500 I dont know what the goal is, but im sure it aint beating it. 

Some people care about beta and sortintino and drawdowns and volatility or whatever the hell else. Personally I just care if im beating the S&P500 or not.; He is not managing other people money. It is a float for Insurance businesses. Berkshire is not asset management, other insurance companies more or less invest mostly in Fixed Income.

I am not sure what the hell everyone around here is talking about. Berkshire delivers consistent returns on equity, which is what matters; It's of course hard, when you are big, and you still try to avoid most tech stock, which are the majority (or very large) position of the available stocks to invest.; The issue is it supposedly wasn’t his pick. If the majority of his gains aren’t from his own brain, that matters.; After adjusting Buffet's stats, removing outliers to project the future, he heavily regresses to around the level of 2018 Kramer.; 1.1B / $26.82 (apple price 2016) * 228.82 (apple current price)
= 9.38B

during that time Berkshire went from $194k to $706k. 

I’m not sure I follow.. now what?; This is the key distinction that everyone is missing.  On a risk adjusted basis, BRK is practically untouchable.; Not even close, Berkshire currently only holds $16 Billion in Bonds so 1.6% of it's $1 Trillion market cap. BRK's cash position is nearly 20 times the size of their bond holdings.; Cherry picking tech bottom


If you use when bro bottom in 2000... Then it's 10.7 for brk and 7.7 for spy....; But why are you cherry picking the bottom of the dot com crash? That will give so the best looking number possible ; I followed him with OXY and am hurting because of it.; He missed many of the tech gains that drove the S&P 500 over the last 20 years because of his long time aversion to tech stocks… he was somewhat late to Apple, but still in time to rack up massive gains from it.; I almost bought ulta when he did. It’s in the 350’s now. I do still believe it’s undervalued but being right at the wrong time is the same as being wrong.; It's about risk management. When the S&P500 returns -50%, Berkshire will return -15%.; The goal is consistent growth.; Yeah, I shouldn’t have made him sound like a fund manager, he’s not directly managing people’s money. But I think that’s being pedantic about the idea being conveyed. He’s not trying to maximize his gains, he’s trying to keep a healthy balance of minimal losses and healthy gains.; But if he's going to die soon, isn't it good that he trusts his managers to make good picks? I still don't see the issue; Doesn’t matter. He is the one that had to make the final decision; You can’t throw out outliers. Buffet is all about outliers. He doesn’t believe in diversification.; Sorry, I changed my response as I saw they bought on several occassion so we would need the full list of their transactions.  I'm not even sure if that's public information.; You're looking at the wrong thing. I think that's their operating cash for their core businesses or something. They have ~272 billion cash/equivalents total.

>Cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills (in millions): $271,835 [on page 37](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/qtrly/3rdqtr24.pdf)


If you were looking at their financial statement on yahoo finance or something, you need to add and subtract a few different numbers (not sure which ones), but one I know you have to add is ""Short Term Investments Available for Sale"" 288,031,000 (the short term treasury bonds, in thousands, aka 288 billion, which is buried under total assets->investments->...).; Why would you invest in an individual pick instead of BRK? I bought BRK and have done well, but I would never buy one of his individual picks. BRK gives you access to BRK's private businesses.; Show me a person who overperformed qqq without riding one, magical stock. 


Predicting long-term success of technology companies seems to be impossible. ; He bought Apple at like 11 PE.; I don't understand this, even since people are cherry picking the bottom of the dot com bust as the time frame.


Bro bottomed in 2000, spy in 2003


I'd bet if you change the timeframe to 2000 brj has outperformed ; He (or probably Ted or Todd) sold it in the last quarter; the beta is like .86 right now which means it's 86% as volatile as s&p; This was like 10+ years ago. I’m not arguing either way, just stating why it’s brought up. He’s clearly smarter than me 😂; Oh, well then. Shoddy here knows how Buffett operates 😂; It wasn't a huge position. I have BRK and BLK in that segment.; Follow up - not too bullish with news like this  
[Warren Buffett Breaks 6-Year Streak, Doesn't Buy Back Berkshire Shares Despite $320B Cash Pile : r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gut0us/warren_buffett_breaks_6year_streak_doesnt_buy/); All of it?; I don't have time to look it up, but I have to assume that's the beta of it's investment portfolio, it's also sitting on a quarter trillion in cash, which is FAR less volatile than the S&P.; Beta isnt always in correlation to the S&P500 it could be anything else.

Also how is it .86 I thought they were mostly cash? Maybe im mistaken.; You seriously think Buffet would allow one of his generals to buy $50 billion in Apple without final approval from Buffet.; Almost; I looked it up: reduced 96% of the position; Wow I’m surprised. They only held for a few months then took a loss? Must be for tax loss harvesting purposes, but I’ve never known Berkshire to hold for that short of a time frame."

At the end of the day if he actually succeeds in forcing social media networks to let Nazis (and similar far-right grifters like Steven Crowder) on their platforms... advertisers will flee and everyone who isn't an asshole will hate going on them. Which is what happened to Twitter.

My fear is that this time Porkenfuhrer will get *competent* who really do dismantle the government.

Trump isn’t president, Putin is.; The megacaps would be able to survive any volatility caused by the trump admin during the next 2-4 years; Not surprising - I think this is more about being pro-Musk than it is about anti-big-tech.

He's the one that accused the Biden administration of using regulators to target Musk's companies and has generally been critical of any time the FCC seems to be in SpaceX's way.; Meta has been complying with Project 2025's wishes already by not taking disinformation spreading seriously.

It’s a sad state of affairs here.; This won't harm the companies so much as it'll harm a free, civil society. The Project 2025 FCC will essentially remove the guardrails that exist for spreading disinformation, so it can fluourish. The GOP is waging an all out war on truth straight from an Orwell book. They are trying to dumb down the schools and spread constant misinformation so they reduce the critical thinking capacity of the public.; the FCC can not break any company up nor is there any hint of that kind of thing coming from this guy; I mean Europe is a perfect example of how going anti-big tech in your legislation/regulation can backfire.

Long story short, regulations like GDPR to crack down on big tech abuses are quite burdensome. Mega cap companies have armies of lawyers and can still afford to comply to it however. But a startup in the same industry often can't afford that kind of stuff, at least anywhere near as easily as a well established company.

So I guess we are agreed that the problem needs to be fixed? This isnt a dems versus republican issue 🤦‍♂️; [removed]; One layer thinking. ; The new generation of kids will grow up on deepfakes and not be able to tell the difference.

We're doomed!; [removed]; [removed]; He said the cartel must be dismantled, cartels are groups of companies working together to e.g. fix prices and are already illegal in the US under anti-competition laws.  Both in the case of cartels and corporate break ups the FTC and DOJ have jurisdiction there, not the FCC.; You mean… current events 🤡🤦‍♂️; It matters when a political administration decides to selectively enforce it or use it to benefit their allies. Even if you think that the upcoming administration won’t do either of these things - what is truly stopping the next administration after them from using these policies to cancel via punitive fines and legal action?; Banning accounts is old stuff. These days artificially inflating one's personal account and takes is the new meta. Elon has mastered this to perfection.; [removed]; The extra layer is imagining that private interests owe your dumbass regurgitated ideas a platform. Self victimization driven by entitlement, simple as that.; So what does breakup them up mean? In what way are they functioning like a cartel? Where is this cartel cooperation with each other? 

I highly doubt Amazon and Microsoft work on their tech together toward some woke agenda given they're big cloud competitors. Or Microsoft and Google given they're search competitors.

It seems more likely to me he means break up the companies like separate Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and Messenger. Or separate Google search from Android, etc. The individual companies are so large and homogeneous I could see a stronger argument of that being what he means.; It is better than companies arbitrarily canceling individuals based off of public pressure. If you are asking me whether i would like it in the governments hands versus private companies that's the risk i'm willing to take.; [removed]; I mean these companies are accused of a ton of anti-competitive practices by the Biden admin and basically all of them have been or are in the process of being sued by them.  Google and Meta have been found to collude to set ad prices, and Google and Apple are in the process of being forced via litigation to end an anti-competitive relationship (payments for Google search on apple.)

It is bipartisan that these companies are anti-competitive and collude with each other.  But in the sentence where he says break up, and in the Project 2025 document he wrote, he is specifically talking about them colluding to censor and applying section 230 in its direct textual interpretation to make them liable if they continue to censor (since lack of liability for content is based on being neutral per section 230.); The large tech companies are one of the few potential threats to trump's rule. So he want's to weaken them. China went after their big tech stocks a few years back for the same reason.; [removed]; [removed]; [removed]; [removed]"
"r/Stocks Daily Discussion & Fundamentals Friday Nov 15, 2024","This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on fundamentals, but if fundamentals aren't your thing then just ignore the theme.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

You will make a killing on LEAPS when oil prices rebound or sell puts 6 months to a year out. Currently you can secure a $12.00 premium at $60 strike for puts expiring in May.

* **Novartis** - puts, $100 strike, December '24 expiration. Wait until after it breaks the 8-day EMA to the upside.
* **Cigna** - puts, $315 strike, December 6th expiration. After the gap up it was rejected at the 50 and 200 EMA simultaneously. CI is currently sitting at the 8-day EMA. Get in if it breaks and finishes below that point. 
* **Tandem Diabetes** - puts, $29 strike, December '24. Wait for it to finish above the 8-day EMA.
* **Nasdaq Inc.** - calls, $80 strike, December '24.

Remember Sunpower $SPWR? They filed for bankruptcy back in mid July. I’m here to tell you why Sunnova is next. 
I’ve worked in solar as a sales manager for roughly 6 years. Sunnova has been struggling to pay their dealers/installers all year. Robbing Peter to pay Paul. Sunnova is basically a Ponzi scheme at this point. Search Reddit/facebook groups particularly where solar industry people talk and it’s a pretty open secret. 

“NOVA holds approximately $7.98 billion in total debt. This represents a 25.33% increase over the past year, contributing to a debt-to-equity ratio of 4.58, which is significantly above industry norms”

They currently sit at a $485 million market cap, eerily similar to Sunpower before they went under. It is only a matter of time for Sunnova. Most dealers/installers are moving all of their volume away from using them as they’ve been late on payments. Instead of the reps getting paid upon install, they are only getting paid now once the system is turned on and activated. Sunnova is going to bankrupt a ton of smaller installers who rely on them for a large chunk of their financing. The last thing solar reps want to do is jeopardize getting paid so they are going to pivot away from selling new Sunnova PPAs/loans. 

Sunnova holds an INSANE amount of debt. I honestly have no idea how they are still afloat. I didn’t think they would make it this far at the beginning of the year. Their free cash flow is in the toilet.

“Sunnova Energy International (NOVA) reported a negative free cash flow (FCF) of approximately -$2.13 billion over the trailing 12 months. This figure is derived from an operating cash flow of -$282.75 million and capital expenditures totaling -$1.85 billion. The significant cash burn highlights the company’s capital-intensive business model and its current inability to generate positive cash flow from operations”

I know what you’re thinking, their stock is already down massively since the election. Yes, that was based on all solar stocks dropping. Sunrun (which I believe will be around for the long haul) also dropped like a rock. However I believe within 6 months Sunnova is going to file chapter 11 and go to 0. 
I don’t think trump will kill the solar tax credit. However it wont matter for Sunnova. Their CEO is a former Enron exec. This company is on its last leg and has been raising debt like crazy to stay afloat. Has worked for far longer than it should have. Their partnership with Home Depot has largely been a dud. Nothing like Sunruns partnership with Costco. 

Unless they are able to raise an insane amount of money or interest rates hit 1% in the next 4 months they are fucked and will be sold off for parts.

People say they’re on Ozempic even when they’re using a competitor; They've managed to completely give up their gains for the year. My intuition says theyre a buy at 102, but my understanding of biotech is their valuation depends a lot on what comes out of their drug trials. Haven't they had some troubles outside of ozempic lately?; It will be fine as they probably got a large number of new subscribers, plus advertising dollars.    Yes, some of new subscribers will bale but with NFL on Christmas Day event - some will hold on to for the quarter.; That’s what I was thinking. Absolutely terrible work from Netflix. I’ve had to resort to watching someone who’s in the arena live streaming the fight from their seat because Netflix crashed; The guy is assembling a cabinet that looks like the Avenger's of corruption and grifting.; This is actually a brilliant strategy by the Republicans. The rich get rich while messing up the country. Democrats then have to spend all of their efforts restoring the country to normalcy and have no time to actually implement any significant Democratic agenda. Republicans then complain Democrats accomplished nothing and get elected again.; What's incredibly scary to me is that we just had an administration prove that you don't need to enact austere, recessionary measures to maintain a healthy economy (and improve inflation). 

The fact that the electorate voted them down encourages future administrations to favor recession over inflation because inflation seems to be a death knell for administrations; Bessent seems like about what I'd expect out of a Treasury pick, it's everyone else he's putting in I'm concerned about.; ""gets tired of grwoth""

Dude, I hate trump as much as the next person, but the US was ONLY GROWING because of insane reckless government spending. If it takes a 6% GDP defecit (or whatever it is) for 3% GDP growth that just means debt to GDP keeps growing and that cannot happen in perpetuity.

The ONLY way out of this is a big recession, or >10% inflation. Somethings gotta give. And the longer it gets kicked down the road, the worse the inevitable recession/inflation will be; Yup, stock market wasn’t up at all before Covid hit when Trump was president!; >The market does need strong and trusted institutions

I wonder whos entire life goal was to undermine them for decades then.

Also the entire premise is off, why does the market needs strong and trusted institutions, it hasn't needed any of that like ever? Also I don't think becoming Europe would bring us investors any sizeable returns; The most likely case is that EoY flows that likely have to happen rescue this market beginning later this month, but all bets are off when we turn the page to 2025. 


My original instincts were right it seems. Gonna have to hold on for dear life seemingly like 2021 (and it may be a case of holding on for 5 months) and it'll be show time next year, probably a mix of 2018/2022.; > trusted institutions.

weird way to spell ""burn it all down.""; There is a lot of inertia in the federal government, and we still have functional, pro business courts.; Is your entire portfolio down as well?; Yep, the stupid is in full force. Let's nominate a sex predator and a frat bro news guy to be in my cabinet.

I am a 2nd amendment loving, anti illegal immigration type guy, but the next 4 years are going to really suck I think.

I'm down quite a bit over the last few weeks.

All news is bad news.; Big oops; That poor dude got wrecked. The one who faded OKLO for nearly $1,000,000 is having a blast though.; I bought more. 6.5% divvy on a pharma megagiant. jesus.; What else you think besides oil? Good call btw oil always comes back; That gap isn’t much, no? 576 and a bit. Or which gap do you mean?; I’ve been watching this one fall since 100. It is starting to get tempting, maybe ill begin building a position; [deleted]; When/why did you start making suggestions for short term option plays? What informs them?; It's astounding how insane the valuation is on this stock.

Makes tsla 400 in 2021 look like a fucking bargain by comparison; Add Karp is slimy and now watching and waiting for him to dump more shares.; I had a 100 shares I bought at $20. Sold a CC for $60 for next year. I also feel it’s bound to see a correction; [deleted]; To be frank, we're getting dangerously close to it being likely the AI cycle ended in the summer after all, with time of year leading to it being hidden until 2025. 


The semiconductor group should NOT be this weak and it is a huge warning that it is.; I'd avoid for now, semi cycle peaked and we're looking for a higher low somewhere.; in a bull market, better buy high sell higher high performance stock. It's not a time for gambling, catch falling knife, you can't tell the price you catch is the bottom yet.; So you’d prefer to be taxed every year on your index fund dividends at a higher marginal rate (and possibly wash sale activity that could screw over taxed advantaged accounts, depending on how you manage your portfolio) over active trades of individual stocks in your taxable? Plus risking huge losses on individual stocks yet not being able to replenish your retirement account if you make a bad trade. 


I find a taxable brokerage account gives me more control, and can be very tax efficient if you manage trades by lot. You can sell all of the high loss/low gain and long term lots first.; Unless you’re using margin. This is the way!!; Thoughts on why are the insiders loading up?; just buy it now, if it goes down buy more, if it goes up buy more; Moves like this usually last longer than people expect. Smart thing to do is stay away from it. It will probably keep rolling over shorts for a while yet.; Been doing it since this morning, now it's not fun; My rule of thumb is don't short in a bull market, not worth the risk; timing is the impossible part and any gaurantee of profits is already baked into the option price.; I mean I suppose it's better for execs to actually care about shareholders making money if you own the stock. But seems to confirm that a lot of their valuation is smoke and mirrors at this point. I sold 80% of my stake at $60. Will sell the other 20% at $70.; As if there wasn't enough of a red flag with the CEO making statements like ""We absolutely eviscerated this quarter"" and ""The winners in AI will be powered by Palantir and the losers will read analyst notes."" On the earnings call: ""Given how strong our results are, I almost feel like we should just go home"".; Healthy pullback is fine; Markets went down about 9""; You got me curious; Go back to it and look at your stocks EOD Monday.; and you didn't invite any of us, big dawg? smh; Maybe for the inidices but lots of stocks are sold off hard with good buy opps.; Because we are in a market bubble only surpassed by 99 and 29. It's fucking insane.

People buy overvalued shit like PLTR and get rewarded by 60% gains in 8 days. This is fucking insane. I can't use the real word to describe this since it's banned on the sub.

This market has gone full simple jack; only the 95th percentile?

seems low; Repeat after me - “ I will buy into the stocks I have conviction in when mr. Market gives me chances, instead of posting the same rant comment multiple times a day”; Why is RKLB a meme stock? Aren't they one of the only companies to make it into orbit?; RemindMe! 2 months; I bought more $TLT this morning.  The current yield is around 3.95%.  US 20 yr interest rates will get below that rate eventually.  The question is when?  And since I can't time the market, I might as well buy the sure thing which is $TLT that will eventually increase in price while collecting a 3.95% yield until US 10-20 yr rates fall below that level.; Is there a chance it goes to the low 80’s again?; I sold all my RKLB at $15 and regret it now. Had a $3 average too. ;(; I sold all at $15 and regret it now. Had a $3 average too. ;(; if you want AI hardware. go nvda or go home. Buy high sell higher. I sold all my NVDA after it beat AMD in price. AI stock performance recently isn't good.; Nice! I keep checking back and seeing it hit $171 makes me wish I sold a bit later haha but gains are gains.; Who’d have thought that naming a true imbecile to be Sec of Health would be perceived as bad for science-based health companies?; With a 12.9 rsi, at the very least would be surprised if it doesn't bounce soon given how massively technically oversold that is.; This and OKLO since he's a board member.


Might see a quick pump/dump this week but longterm might be good bets.; Super bullish for OKLO, Wright had invested $10M at a very early stage- he’s sold on SMRs and especially their solution, along with Thiel; wouldnt mind it pulling back til January; You need at least a 30% pullback for healthy valuations.; Because someone actually bought the Pokemon Greninja ex 214/167 Pokemon TCG Twilight Masquerade Special Illustration Rare card for $329.99 yesterday on Ebay marking the top of the speculative bubble : ); The +23% this year isn't good enough?; Nothing a few million dollars in donations won’t solve; I still don’t see how his appointment affects LLY and NVO in any significant way; I’ve been buying the dip on PFE 🤷🏼‍♂️; If healthcare is going the way of the dinosaur then i guess it's time to sell.  

You can clearly see people freaking out over day to day action.; As someone who invested in them heavily 2019-2023, I'd avoid chip equipment for awhile personally. Lam Research, Applied Materials, ASML, and KLAC all seem primed to see declining growth and shortening backlog the next year or two due to the massive global fab build out we've seen now getting into operation. I also expect China sanctions/tariffs to hit them hard. Foundries (TSM, Intel, Samsung, etc) are probably going to be taking a step back from the massive capex orders they've been putting in to recoup their investments for awhile.; Probably going to be pain until next year. A lot of the chip market for autos and industrials have sucked for the past year. 

Hopefully will rebound next year, but pieces for these companies are actually solid for long term holds. ; Powell said yesterday fed isn’t in a rush to reduce rates; December rate cuts went from 83% to 50s. Powell said economy too strong, will have to wait and watch; Zoom out.; Same, I topped up AMAT, ASML and started a position in LRCX.; That's funny.  I see Meta will face antitrust over Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions by US courts when I google Facebook : ); [deleted]; Ill take it til January but then it needs to go up; Yes

And a P/S of 50

And a PEG of 148; HVAC and electrification are strong global trends. ; healthcare and maybe enwrgy; I agree with Lance on energy. Personally I think solar and nuclear (more focus on nuclear) will be really great investments for the 10-20 year time frame. The new admin coming in has indicated that solar and nuclear are both focuses; Same with my shares of $KMI.  I am not complaining in 2024, thou. Oil & gas pipelines stocks have had a nice bullrun this year.; How is everyone suddenly talking about ONTO. I hadn’t seen that name before and now it appears all the time.; Buy high sell low; The same as what's happening with the majority of the market. If Nasdaq is down 2.2% as it currently is, chances are AMZN isn't green.; RSU vests today. Bulk sell orders bringing the price down. Same with META; Yeah I bought. Most popular GenZ brand, expanding internationally, and expanding into rural areas with dollar store.; What's the moat w these ultas and elfs; Actually it would be dumb if it didn't accrue. It's not like the money is taking a vacation.; should i still drop 2k on it or wait; Daylight savings; Its November 15; I must be holding the wrong European stocks. NVO, ROG, ASML and AZN are all red.; I'm honestly surprised all the risks from China aren't *already* priced in. You'd think they would be - it's not like the political uncertainty has ever been secret - but I guess the market is still trying to figure it out.; I think CELH could definitely work from here, its just still a big gamble of consumer preferences. You are at least 100% smarter than the momo guys who bought at 90; Classic redditor moves. Stock goes down people think its trash and sell it (see posts around last google dip). Stock pumps and people fomo into it until someone finds the top lel.; AMD is almost there.; Mpwr, although it still looks expensive and their are rumors circulating about their nvda allocation; Axcelis technologies is down like 60% but auto semiconductors need to start recovering before there’s any decent upside.; HITI for me any day of the week; idk, mortgage rates have been going up since the Fed first started cutting rates...if the 10-year keeps going up, homebuilders margins will come into question even more.; Honestly I feel bad for you. The writing was on the wall and the short bounce above $3 was one my best stock option exits yet, especially now with hindsight regarding the bankruptcy.

Your options are currently worth 0, some brokers support selling on OTC markets, not sure about fidelity. Also you have to check the status of the stock on OTC, it might be halted due to the bankruptcy for some time. I would say there will be 0 liquidity for your options anyways. You might have to work with Fidelity directly to sell it.

But to be frank, I am not sure how long dated are the options you are holding, but your only way out is if the stars align and someone buys the company along with the debt, otherwise you are wiped out. Rules of the casino.; Imo Trump is not going to have the effect on oil that he's touting. The real drill baby drill president was Biden. The US is now producing record amounts of oil with falling fuel prices. Oil companies aren't going to produce more and risk another bust situation.; Expectations are in the gutter for Disney, and sky high for mega-cap tech. It's that simple.; stocks dont move proportionally to fundemetnals changes. 

stocks often stay depressed (or elevated) for long periods, then suddenly something changes and the stocks moves alot

sentiment finally changing for disney. 

look at sofi as an example - improving fundementals for years, stock goes nowhere. suddenly one additional quarter of the same thing and the stock pretty much doubles. 

why didnt it happen the previous quarters? why didnt stock move up slowly as earnings kept beating? why did it stay pretty much flat?; Because it does that.  

Monday it will be up irrationally as well.; Powell's remarks today indicated the Fed may slow down or halt its rate cut schedule. This alone would not have triggered a selloff except the import price index came in very hot and business inventories were smaller than anticipated. Then there were some of Trump's picks for cabinet positions.; Powell said no rate cuts in December. And some trump picks scared the market. He said he would also remove AI barriers that Biden put in and imposed tariffs so the tech sector is selling off more than the general market; Borderline crashing.  

Good!  It's getting to January to buy oil stocks at the bottom.; Wym cancer?; It’s a long term buy. Doesn’t matter what price it is just buy; I plan on bulking up in VOO next week.; The news hit yesterday. Not sure why it took Wall Street 24 hours to notice; The govt is trying to force Google through the courts to spin off the Chrome web browser due to concerns it increases Google’s monopoly on search; Where were you just 1 month ago; never hurts to take gains equal to what you bought for; why has PLTR been so volatile?; At a 150 forward pe, I would at least be asking covered calls and making back my purchase price. ; Nice pick. Financial look perfect. Too good to be true.  But it's real , lol.; Yes depending on your time horizon; You are getting downvoted by this sub so yes. It will be a x10 bagger lol.; Nope. Never sell. I got 20-25 more years.


I guess if you are a trader; Makes no difference which of these sp500 etfs you buy; ...
No.


Hold for 20 years; Not fucked, just slightly cooked for a couple months; Mayhaps.; 0% chance; No; As much a chance as any company; It's been two days of red no? ; RFK’s pronouns are they/them because you have to account for the worm in his brain.; Worms will do that to you; We are buying cause they got smoked -40% already, I guess they could keep dropping but its not like out of hype atm; Long run we will be fine. I bought AMZN and GOOG bigly in December 2021 and ok with that today. Probably won’t feel worse.; All forecasts are more or less meaningless. Why would 1-2% increase in spy be such an unmeasurable hurdle?; I wouldn't. If it's getting delisted odds are they're not in good shape. I understand risk/reward, but the risks there, in my opinion, don't justify the potential rewards. SMCI is interesting, but you don't get one of the big accounting firms to dip on you without some serious issues. I'd avoid it.; Do you actually know what santa rally is? How tf do you know what will or wont happen a month from now???; ASML also just confirmed their 2030 earnings, so the growth is there. I agree, it's going to be painful in the  short to med term, but long term, these are good prices.; Few things. They basically have like no debt and have worked on great acquisitions for the last few years. 

Chip makers are moving towards square wafers and there is a lot of gains happening in the advanced packing market. This is more Onto’s space. 

They’ve also managed the market really well considering industrial and auto market has been in a downturn. 

As far as the dilution goes, not too sure, but also doesn’t seem like a huge concern. There is only 49M shares available on the float and YoY they increase the share count by .74%; Different company than ONTO; Why for individual stocks if your goal is to hold for 5-10 years?; MyPillow CEO appointed to head Department of Anti Woke Services. (Can't even get a goods nights sleep anymore because woke)

Long mattresses and pajamas; president trump will anounce his secretary is an instagram influencer and has coined his new name as ""president donald tesla robo elon trump"". 

michael judge will be siting there launging maniacally; I’m seeing down 6% ytd. Where are you seeing 2%?; It will also be interesting to get to know about their new cagrisema drug. Results should come out in november/december. Could definitely come with a reversal in the stock price if results are good!; There will be results from their new drug cagrisema either this month or next. Investors are also nervous about, if their acquisition of Catalent will go through. If it gets blocked, it will set Novo Nordisks ability to ramp up their production back significantly. However, they do have a ""plan b"", whatever that might be..; We don't have a long-term healthy economy. 

During the last two years of Biden's term, the government spent 6-7% of GDP to maintain GDP growth of 2-2.5%. Mind you, governments typically spend 2.5-3% of GDP during recessions as a countercyclical measure. Private sector investment and payrolls have been abysmal during that time, not to mention GO has trailed GDP since 2022. Gross output *front runs* gross domestic product during a recovery.; Trump added 8tr to debt and only 2 tr to GDP. Biden added 8tr to debt, but 8tr to GDP. It's a blowout. Trump performance of 4 to 1 debt to gdp ratio is unsustainable and will collapse the economy. ; .....Trump added 8tr and next to little gdp. Biden done a lot better; It's a revenue problem.  6.4 percent of gdp on discretionary spending us historically low.


https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-is-discretionary-spending-in-the-federal-budget/#:~:text=In%201973%2C%20discretionary%20spending%20amounted,with%20concerns%20about%20national%20security.


Much of that is spent on the military, veterans benefits, etc, which most people wouldn't consider optional.


https://usafacts.org/articles/how-much-of-the-federal-budget-is-discretionary-spending/; It was up, then came crashing down when he botched the handling of it by telling people to drink bleach. ; yes 75 months lf growth from Obama; I mean he did inherit economy from Obama. He didn’t add anything other than tax cuts. But a sign of a strong stock market  is how it responds to adversity

Trump let it crash with Covid 

Biden actually had to pass things to make this stock market resilient. And look despite everything happen look at it now; I’m about to lose all the gains from him getting elected; We no giant anymore. Our MC is pathetic. Still holding tho.; I've been pretty critical of LEU as not being worth $100 based on fundamentals, but it's starting to retreat back into sensible territory. If it falls below $60 it's worth looking into. Some of the mid-tier and junior gold miners are getting beaten up due to gold price and the failures of the large caps, yet they're still recording record margins and FCF. WDOFF, GAU, SAND, FSM, etc. are trading cheap atm; AEM is woefully underpriced compared to its blowout earnings report. ANET is oversold IMO. Ditto for biotech and health care. 

My main recommendation is to run puts on individual stocks. The weak ones with strong downward trends are going to get destroyed if the indices continue falling, giving you the opportunity to make a lot of money quickly and recycle that cash into the oversold strong ones. My portfolio is flat today but I'm up 3% overall due to fading HSY. u/Deep_CFC did even better.; 5750 is the 50-day MA, 5700 is the pre-election floor, 5400 is the September 6th floor, and 5180 is the August bottom. Given that election FOMO broke the rising wedge pattern that would've led to a normal correction, there's a real chance we break the 50 EMA and the pre-election floor.; None of them have hit their marks yet. 

The market open doesn't factor in.

NDAQ is still fine to enter. It's a long play with plenty of room to run.; When? About a month ago.

Why? Because short-term option trades are among the safest and most lucrative ways of making money *if* they are exploiting the structural makeup of the stock market. This is the opposite of gambling on directional plays or using them to hedge a larger portfolio. Additionally, it allows consistent cash flow to recycle into the main portfolio.

What informs them? The nature of the strategy. All of them - I use 3 to 4 right now - rely on piggybacking off the money flow in stocks/ETFs in different ways. 

Currently I'm selling off some holdings to allocate 30% of the portfolio to options. It will be a substitute for bonds, whose profit factor pales in comparison and returns don't compound.; Always a massive red flag when the CEO of a public company makes statements like ""We absolutely eviscerated this quarter"" and ""The winners in AI will be powered by Palantir and the losers will read analyst notes."" On the earnings call: ""Given how strong our results are, I almost feel like we should just go home"".; What expiration?; Like Instagram and Whatsapp? What are more popular alternatives to those?; Correct. 

SMH has not come close to recapturing its July high despite the market attaining several new ATHs. It's failed to decisively break $260 resistance twice during that timespan, and now it's rolling over. Semis were in the red even during the post-election hype rally.; Depends on the semi exposure. The only line of business for the past year or so that has been good was the advanced compute/ai stuff. 

If you follow the market, auto and industrial names that are more of the dumb chips have not found a bottom and have been seeing sales slump for a while.; Shorting is the ultimate fomo game. I don't think I've ever made money buying puts but I'm always right about overpriced companies in the long term. ; Word; agree, lots under the surface thats plenty cheap; Please name a few good blue chip stocks that have fallen pretty good i see amazon which i can buy. I have some cash sitting on the sidelines; This is Trump's economy now, so the only companies that will do good in the future have a direct hand in his corruption. That is why TSLA and PLTR are up, it's because they will directly benefit from this corruption.; I remember '99. I was there. I lost 30k in the Dot Com bubble bursting. 2000/2001 basically.

This is not the same as that. Because, for every AppLovin or Palantir that we have right now, we had 30 more in 1999. It's only a few stocks here and there that are going nuclear.

If things were really as amazing as people make it out to be, my portfolio would be sky high and it isn't.

Unfortunately, I don't have a Palantir or AppLovin in my lineup. My only stock that's pumped recently has been Palo Alto, but it's pump was incredibly mild compared to some of the highflyers. I have a bunch of stocks that have gone nowhere recently. Google, Broadcom and AMD are three great examples. All wallowing in the mud, for various reasons. Broadcom is up if you zoom out, but I only bought it earlier this year. I didn't get it in 2023, wish I did.

Basically, the point I'm trying to make is that in 1999, the equivalent of Google, AMD and Broadcom would all be going absolutely sky high. Everything was topping. It wasn't just the hardcore internet plays with high potential and zero real-world profits that were going absolutely nuclear..... even the regular stocks were going wild. We don't have that right now. Is Apple $245 right now? Is Microsoft $500 right now?; > Because we are in a market bubble only surpassed by 99 and 29. 

based on what?; I’m just saying the obvious mate and I’m not complaining about any stock stock falling specifically rn; Because it doesn't trade on fundamentals and has a cult following, It's not a bad company per se, I myself own some shares, but it's just trading on vibes with P/S of 28, higher than that of SpaceX; I will be messaging you in 2 months on [**2025-01-15 16:44:21 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2025-01-15%2016:44:21%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1grtfyq/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_nov/lxaelx7/?context=3)

|-|-|-|-|; Over what time span? Eventually yields will retreat in the short-term but I believe we're in a secular upwards trend.; you mean RKLB?
It's the best space stock IMO . Have revenue, revenue keep growing, the least volatile compare to gsat asts lunr.; I wanted to be greedy, but once it hit $171.50 I figured it was best to take the money and run. 

For someone who just started options trading, you hit the jackpot on this one. Don't feel any regrets about not trying to maximize down to the dollar.; We'll have to wait and see. Won't have the TFSA room for it until January anyways, but I'll keep an eye out.; didnt think about a pump & dump because of this. damn good looking out.; does he have experience in small scale nuclear or has he said something about it? i just know his background is, in part, in fossil fuels and possibly some self-delivering mechanisms whatever they are.; They’ve doomed us all; I’ve meant the P/E ratio being so low lmao. Just because it has went up doesn’t mean it’s not undervalued af; I am looking into LRCX and KLAC. Already have some AMAT and ASML , down some though. Once we commit to holding long term and factor in the demand for power/cost efficient chip and the associated complexity, it should work out great.; Yeah I’m excited to see what the earnings look like once the “dumb chips” inevitably rebounds.

If that rebounds and AI chip demand stays strong, earnings could be insane the next few years; That's bullish cuz it means economy isn't fooking exploding; No interest in CDNS and klac?; That one has been eclipsed by the EU one.; They can't control them, so all they can do is extort them. 

No difference than paying the mob ""protection"" money.; Karp is god your name opinion is invalid pltr to 500/share; Something like 70% of Britain doesn't have AC and for some weird reason, global temps are higher....; Midstream should enjoy a nice decade ahead, so we're in a good spot to slowly add to our holdings.; There is another user here, i always forget their name, that had a post around equipment maker names. If follow the chip space, outside of advance computer, there has been a ton of weakness in auto and industrial markets. 

A lot of these names have come down in price and are looking like solid longs, but there is still going to be pain until those markets recover. 

With ONTO in particular, they did just report earnings on the 31st and I recently got into them after learning more about them. 

I know a lot of people are kind of hit or miss with youtube, but I would highly suggest watching the video from chip stock investor on ONTO. We can't post youtube links here, but they are hands down one of the best ways to learn about a lot of these companies. They are trying to sell you on their discord/news letter, but overall still gives you great content from the videos.; Not going to lie, I had only been eyeing AMAT, but I saw ONTO in this thread, looked at its stats, and like it at a glance. It seems like it’s on sale in today. I’m part of the Reddit repeat problem. Have no position, but it’s on my radar from this subreddit.; Thanks, Interesting to know.; Great to know, solid growth story.; no idea about ulta moat but they must have something  - look at those margins. Elf is is a marketing machine with high margin beauty product company attached. Not sure how old you are but it is hard, imo, for the over 50 crowd to understand ( and stomach) the way marketing to younger women has to be handled now. Its clear that both L'oreal and Estee Lauder have had a hard time responding the demands of a younger consumer when there was choice. The ""moat"" is its human capital imo. Once the street gets a better handle on elf's ability to grow at a lower growth rate the stock will probably regain its upward trend. It won't grow like in the past but likely has a ton of runway left over the medium and longer term.

Naive question: Intel 18A--what could go wrong?,"\[Disclosure: not invested in Intel yet but thinking about doing so\]

Ok, we know Intel messed up and whatever but what I do not get (so please challenge my train of thoughts):

* Intel got newest machines from ASML last year
* They use them for 18A
* Like TSMC does for AMD, Apple, etc.
* Lunar Lake is a combo of Intel's design skills and TSMC's/ASML's fab skills
* But with low margins because of latter
* However, Lunar Lake turned out pretty good, so Intel's design skills are def there
* And with 18A, Intel will have everything in-house

So, what could go wrong? Maybe Intel need quite some time to catch up and have the same fab capacity based on ASML machines but we will get there at some point.

The competition? AMD will have (long-term!) lower margins b/c of TSMC (also slower time-to-market, lower quantities), Qualcomm has lower compat and needs still to resort issues with ARM, Nvidia while capable will need some time and will have a good offer but they won't have a fab either and will face compat issues like Qualcomm. Not saying that these are dealbreakers but yeah...

What does speak against Intel: org is too messed to get it ever restructured and/or reorg too expensive, running out of money (but gov money), time, building fabs needs years, zero EUV experience, low yields for years

Edit: Intel has a lower market cap than AMD despite AMD just having design in-house, they have more assets in the GPU department but it is insignificant compared to something like Nvidia and if we talk about IGPUs Intel seem to be on par

Edit2: Would at least a new CEO just give us a bump, so we could leave again with some short-term gains?

Intel has proven time and time again that they are not able to ramp “relatively easier” products. I find it laughable they are able to do ramp the harder products knowing their track records.; Easy. For me, Intel always overpromises and under delivers, at least since the 2000s. I want them to just deliver as promised. Many companies under promise and over deliver. I just want intel to deliver as they say without any excuses (water issues for fabbing, management issues, CEO issues, EUV issues, anything... including the ""unexpected"").; WCGW with 18A?

Seems like a bullshit; Boils down to management & corporate governance. While your argument points may be valid, the company has yet to show that they have had a proven track record to turn company around.

Park money there and check back in 4 years (under Trump WH policies).; I just bought INTC (because of the low P/S) while already holding positions in TSMC and Qualcomm. I'm drunk, though.; Modern logic chips can contain thousands of steps inside a fab, each one needs to be optimized to achieve a very high yield so that products can be profitable. It's a huge labor and capital intensive, systematic work. 

I think you underestimate the complexity. EUV is just some steps involved, and by simply having EUV does not guarantee success. From design to fab, all have to work like stars aligned to make Intel come back strong.

Not saying intel is going belly up, because Uncle Sam won't let that happen (like, Boeing). But if failed, profitability will take a great hit, and may never recover.; I'll save you some money. Go on Intel's website, download their annual report and read the whole thing.

So people busted their ass to get into semiconductor industry.  And they work like a slave after they get in there because ""they have no other choice"".

There is no way US worker are willing to do that.; No chance.  They can't even get the 7nm or 5nm right, how to jump to something like 2nm? 

Samsung foundry has proven their processes to be better than Intel.  And look how far behind they are TSMC still; Yeah that is a valid point, they proved that they can't which might hint a totally broken org (and/or wrong tech). However, they didn't do EUV in the past, do you think that this might change something this time?; Would you be able to provide more colour on why Samsung and Intel are unable to increase yield at TSM levels despite having the “same” equipment from ASML? Is it solely due to the difference in quality of labour?

Also would like to hear your thoughts on whether skipping generation is a feasible/only way in semis? I notice Samsung and intel have the tendency to do so. Yet as you rightly mentioned how would they be able to compete in a harder tech when they can’t even get the basic right. I guess what I am asking is we all know about the difficult of skipping generation, but why are intel and Samsung still trying to do so? Is there not enough demand to be the 2nd/3rd best player?; they didn't with Lunar Lake, so design-wise they are on the edge; 10 & 7 nm run fine, but have bad margins due to no EUV. Not great, but fine.
3 / 4 nm run ok now, but are not competitive enough to win external customers. Basically just too late, otherwise was fine.


20A was a one-product premature version of 18A, it's a very bad look they canceled this. If we can believe their take that this was due to refocus on 18A because that is going so well, then maybe it turns out fine. If they simply couldn't make it work well, then not so much.


14A is not in doubt, where did you read that?


I think Intel's real problem is the design and integration. Their first real chiplet advanced packaged chips in Lunar Lake are horribly unoptimized for the consumer space. They need learning cycles to refine, but they might not have enough for 18A to be wildly successful.

The other challenge is getting customers to fill the fab space. Who will pay big bucks for Intel if TSMC is available.; \> No, they use them for 14A

source that they do not use ASML for 18A?

\> Seems like a bullshit

what big EUV exp does intel have?; Bullish; Pat Gelsinger performing an exorcism live at the next earnings call is suspiciously not listed there.; even with more expensive US workers, Intel's margins will be higher than with outsourcing to TSMC; Sure they are.  Just pay them like Google and Meta pay their engineers.  Pay enough relative to the median wage of other US jobs, and top engineers will be busting their ass to get in.  What's total compensation for a senior engineer at Intel versus one at Meta?

If you can't afford to do that, it's cool, but don't anyone pretend it's a mystery why Taiwanese companies are getting better semiconductor results.  They're paying for best of the best relative to the other opportunities in their country.; \>  how to jump to something like 2nm?

using EUV/ASML; I think you are underestimating how difficult it is to ramp new tools like EUV (or even high NA EUV). If Intel is able to ramp their EUV, their 7nm products will be already successful and we will not even talk about this story at the first place. 

Samsung also does EUV for their logic products, but their yield is so horrible that QCOM ran away from them to TSMC.

It’s like this, EUV allows you noobs to climb Everest, but it still requires capable bodies and massive efforts to reach the peak.; It's not about the equipment but about the process. Every step needs to be extremely well controlled and understood. Each step has many variables that can be tuned, thousands of parameters to be set in the equipment and it all needs to be controlled with feedback loops to find and keep the sweet spot.


TSMC has very advanced and successful analysis systems that have helped them really understanding how each critial step is doing and whether/ what they need to slightly tweak to adjust for fluctuations upstream.


Samsung has had issues with not being able to find where the real issues are in the process, struggling to find a good sweet spot to begin with.


Intel has had process issues, but also design issues where they went for an architecture that relied on some process steps to be really good...and they weren't and could not be fixed without open heart surgery.
But still much more controlled and promising than Samsung, just not at the efficency and margins of TSMC.



They can skip a generation because the learnings build upon each other, so you can just keep going beyond the point where you could've put a stick in the sand and say ""this process flow I will freeze and make a technology line"". Just keep going with development, and you'll end up at another of those opportunities, and you'd call that a next generation. There are some real revolutions in design, those a more binary jumps, like bspdn and gaa.

The Downside is that you don't monetize, and don't learn any new insights from indistrializing the process. But if you can eat the cost then it can pay off.; 18A is not the first EUV/ASML node. Intel 4 and 3 already use EUV and no DUV, it was only Intel 7 that was on DUV. 

[https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/resources/high-volume-euv-intel-4-europe.html#gs.i7bfqm](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/resources/high-volume-euv-intel-4-europe.html#gs.i7bfqm)

High NA EUV, the new machines will only be used on 18A for risk analysis and not for production. The new tools will only be used in 14A production. [https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-foundry-opens-new-frontier-chipmaking.html#gs.i78dib](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-foundry-opens-new-frontier-chipmaking.html#gs.i78dib)

Additionally, just buying the tool means nothing because latest data from IBM/IMEC shows the new tools will also need Metal organic resists and there are no reports from Intel on how they are progressing with those.; Thought u were talking about high-na euv; 14A will be the first process where they won't be at least partly dependent on TSMC.; That's not how it goes. TSMC has PhD's working 70 hours without overtime for a low salary because they have such a monopoly position in the msrket locally. So it would be like working in the US for Tesla but getting paid 75K and not having better companies around to jump to.


They basically get >30% more PhD level labor than is possible in US, because here workers have flexibility and demand good pay. They run into this in Arizona already, turns out its not that Intel is so inefficient, but that the US labor laws and culture are different.; lold; If tuning a process was simply buying machinery, then anyone could do it. 

Why is TSMC the only choice now then?; I agree and wrote myself ""zero EUV exp"". But again, right now Intel has the same design skills as AMD but still have half of latter's market cap (plus some old fabs plus some new ASML machinery without proper fabs yet); I would like to add for Samsung. Korean company with chaebol base like Samsung is very famous for their poor cultural issues. Like Korean drama, constant blame game and shifting responsibility instead of all hands of deck and resolving the issues. Thus, resulting in particularly slow and steady bleeding. While they have smart people, they may not able to utilise in effective and efficient manners.

And to answer people that insist EUV is able to save the company, Samsung is one company that is very aggressive on implementing EUV in 1Z DRAM, where hynix only start putting in on 1alpha, and Micron only start putting in on 1gamma. And yet, samsung is the one behind in DRAM now.

EUV is not the saviour, its a tool. It depends on who wields it. Either is a genius, or fool, only time will tell.; Also would like to know if anybody successful jump generation before? My understanding was Samsung failed multiple times in both DDR5 and logic using GAA; Thank you the for the explanation. Are there any books/channel that you could recommend for a non tech/engineering guy to read up and get up to speed with the term (sufficient to understand whats a FinFET and GAA).; the whole debate is not about which exact ASML model they use BUT more that 18A is the first EUV/ASML node (using latest machines) and that that might change their trajectory; IDK, I have just read that still some quantities or part of Panther Lake should be done by TSMC; \> If tuning a process was simply buying machinery, then anyone could do it.

good point and imagine, a new player had to start a fab, from scratch. they would have to build of everything. intel in contrast has everything, except the fabs, and building those is hard enough but at least they are doing it now, you could now say what's with samsung, tbh idk why their fabs are so behind

\> Why is TSMC the only choice now then?

idk, maybe bc a fab is so complex and running these ASML machines are hard to operate, a bit like McDonalds soft serve machines; probably because TSMC doubled-down on ASML very early and ordered max amount of EUV machines; May, but doesnt have to

It is not like they didnt have time to get small scale experience with this technology in prev. years; Intel *has* the fabs. The process of demoing obsolete machinery and installing cutting edge tools, then tuning, qualling, and ramping takes years.

Reddit thinks a 5 year timeline takes 6 months and it is consistently hilarious.; >intel in contrast has everything, except the fabs,

1.) Should we put all of it in VOO and VTI? (He wants VOO, I want VTI.) We are thinking yes, but is there a reason we shouldn’t? We want to leave it for 15 years. 

2.) Also, should we do it now? Like today, this week?

3.) Should we do it all at once, bulk buy? 

Thanks!

TLDR: Should we lump sum invest $200k in VOO and $180k in VTI and leave for min. 15 years? 

",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1grdzoi/husbandwife_all_in_on_voo_vs_vti_or/,23,"1. 85% of VTI is just VOO. So they’re almost identical. The difference is that VTI also contains small cap and mid cap stocks that VOO does not.


2. Time in the market beats timing the market. So Yes. 


3. See above.; I'd pick VOO; If you’re only going to hold 1 US fund I would pick VTI/VTSAX.

Since he’s on Fidelity I would just use FXAIX for the S&P500 or FZROX for the total US market.

If you really want to, you can add VXUS for the total international market too.

I would just do it all at once and get it over with. Just don’t react if it goes down immediately after buying.; Yes, his $200k into his choice of VOO, your $180k into your choice of VTI, no reason to argue and pick only one. Yes, all at once, right now.

I’m not sure when you got out of your previous positions, but if it was before the election, that’s kind of unfortunate. You could wait hoping for a bigger correction, but if that doesn’t happen soon you’d just get more and more left behind.

Ideally when moving money around you’d sell some and buy some on the same day so that the overall fluctuations in market sentiment cancel out (repeatedly if necessary). But if you already sold, then buying back in ASAP would in general minimise the effects of the swap.

Bogleheads would have you put some money into non-US investments. Might want to consider that.; VTI; 50/50 :) will be interesting to see how they compare over the next 15 years.; To keep y'all from fighting so 50% voo 50% vti. Who ever is right gets a kiss; Depends if you're 30 or 65; There performance is very similar, so if the difference is small, may as well go with the one that offers more diversification.; Both are good but not truly diversified stock portfolios when taken alone.

VOO = mega cap growth. Missing Midcap, small cap and international. A bet that the next 15 years will be like the last 15 and US mega cap will outperform. 

VTI = total US, market-cap weighted. About 80% of this is VOO. No international. Again, a bet the US will, as a country, continue to outperform. 

If I could only choose 1 fund I would choose VT or AVGE. VT is a true total world stock index. AVGE is a world stock ETF, somewhat run through some rules to have a bit of tilt toward smaller and value.

I want to own the world's stocks for real diversification. My belief is the next 15 years will be unlikely to mirror the last 15.

But let there be no doubt, VOO and VTI will almost certainly outperform a large majority of actively managed funds.; It doesn’t matter which one, you can DCA if you are concerned about the market sharply dropping but just throwing the lump sum in is fine; VTSAX; Invest NOW.  Very little difference between VOO and VTI. (Pennies, not dollars); *Men Are from VOO, Women Are from VTI*; [deleted]; You didn't mention how the first 2 accounts are allocated. What do you mean you can't sell because of fees in the third?

What happens in 15 years? Retirement, or that's just things 5o remain as they are now? If 15 years is retirement you should be starting to shift away from 100% equities soon.

As far as how to invest within equities, market weight is the default so unless you have a good reason to deviate go with that.; I'm in similar situation.  Have $400k from an inheritance to figure out.

I'm going to do:

60% VOO

20% AVUV

10% VUG

10% VXUS

I invested $5K into each one immediately.  Then I'm doing $2k every Monday into each automatically.  If the market goes down, I'll increase the amounts.; [deleted]; Go for lower fees. BKLC is zero fees and doing as well or better than VOO.

Or State Street’s SPLG, lower fees and lower share price than VOO, for same returns.

Vanguard isn’t the best deal anymore and their customer service has tanked.  ; I’d vote for neither, but if you must VTI is the better option though minimally since VOO and VTI overlap 86% in weight. You won’t likely see a huge difference in returns but VTI is slightly more diversified. 

If you’re open to it, consider widening your portfolio to include international developed,  emerging markets, and bonds. I’d also seriously reconsider halting contributions to QQQ, APPL, and VUG if you haven’t already (I know you said you can’t sell). If you really want to increase your risk then focus on increasing compensated risk rather than uncompensated risk; Yep; Or what?; If you’re investing over 50k just get somebody that knows what they are doing. Don’t listen to some teenager on Reddit tell you how to spend your hard earned money.  But to each their own.; No, none of the above.  

Many of the people on r/Bogleheads have no idea what a Boglehead is, so I don't know what you're getting there.  Go to the Bogleheads web site, find the Getting Started section of the wiki, & learn about the Bogleheads Philosophy.; Carvana; [deleted]; I disagree with your answer to 3 implying it doesn’t matter. I think with an amount this large, it should be DCA’d as losing a random 1 or 2 % of 400k would be jarring; If you are fidelity is there any downside to
Purchasing VOO? Like do they add fees for buying g funds outside your brokerage firm; Thank you. 
I dont think we were able to purchase until the funds hit his new Rollover IRA? But I might be wrong here. He did move it post election. 

Personally, I’m hearing so much about a market correction so I’m a little hesitant to lump sum especially as I see it going down - but normally I’d just put it all in yesterday and not think about it again. For instance, today is down? Is there a day it’s supposed to stop dropping? lol I know that’s crazy to ask, and I’m sure the answer will be the same as always “don’t time the market”.. but the prediction was that it would increase post election and that happened… just wondering if there’s any hearsay around about it bc I am so new to this, I definitely wouldn’t know or hear about it!; Could also look at the past 15 years to get an idea, if you don’t feel like waiting.; 38! Husband is 44; Voo is s&p 500 not mega cap growth.; I’m concerned with the market sharply dropping but would like to just lump sum it now!; So, just throw all $400k in without a thought even though it’s considered such an all time high market?; His account just moved into a Rollover IRA a few days ago, no positions, just money market waiting to be invested.

My account is in an HYSA at 5% but rates are going down and would like to invest 90% of it. 

Third account - was invested in the above mentioned funds for 10 years, and there’s fees and taxes to pay on them if I pull now. Not sure if it’s worth it to do that just to get into VOO/VTI. 

Plan is for him to retire in 15 years.

*we MAY sell our house which has 1.3 million in equity - 1.1 million is all profit - and put it in the market in the next year or two as well. This thread is just us starting to invest more wisely and strategically for retirement.; What are you doing with the rest of the funds in the meantime?; Did you lump sum invest recently?; So I’m fairly new to investing myself and I’m getting ready to dive into a total market ETF of which I’m exploring tons of options right now. 
I looked up  BKLC and yes, it is trading at a much lower share even though it does have very similar holdings to Voo.
If they are both holding similar holdings and their return is generally the same why is one trading at like $113 a share and VOO is like $545 a share? 
Thanks; Don't listen to redditors he says, but yet THIS guy clearly knows what he's talking about. /s; Lmaooo why you down voting it but it’s the truthhhhh.  Sorry if I offended the great traders of Reddit.; Care to elaborate?; Bogleheads is a conservative way of investing. Surly, John Bogles investing strategy is outdated as global markets change; [https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/arcx/voo/portfolio](https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/arcx/voo/portfolio)  
[https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/arcx/vti/portfolio](https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/arcx/vti/portfolio)

No, it wouldn't make sense for two market cap weighted funds to have the same percentages if one has more holdings.; Feelings vs data. Data says put it all in.; This is my main concern! Mainly bc of the large amount.; Nope, no fees. 

Only difference is VOO is an ETF and has an expense ratio of 0.03%. FXAIX is an Index Mutual Fund has an expense ratio of 0.015%, so half the fees to follow the same index. Just remember mutual funds only trade once a day after market close.; Why would you listen to me or anyone else? Nobody knows shit about anything. The election was different as the outcome of the votes would decide the effect on the stock market. Although to be honest, I have no clue whether if Harris had won would the market have gone down (Tesla would have for sure). 

Once people start to know shit about something, the market will price that in. Stock prices will move based on rumours and expectations, well before the actual event happens. If lots of people think that it’s going to go down some more before recovering, then the current price is already reflecting that sentiment because some people/institutions have sold waiting to buy in lower.

The only thing we can be pretty sure of is that in the long run, the market goes up. So statistically it’s better to buy in earlier. Anything more than that, you’ll tie yourself up in knots trying to figure it out.; Pick up a copy of The Little Book of Common Sense investing! You will thank yourself later. 
 
VTI represents the average return of the US stock market. If you want to do better than VTI then you need to have someone on the other side who is going to do worse than VTI. 

There are a lot of really smart people working on Wall Street and they hold the majority of the US market. I don’t want to bet against them!

The people drumming up fear of recessions or predicting the next bull market don’t have your best interests at heart. They don’t know. If they did it’s unlikely they’d share it with you as well.

https://jasonzweig.com/wall-streets-wisest-man/; Yeah then 15 years is just fine. Reasses when he's about 5-7 years from retirement.; I realize it's an S&P 500 fund. You're missing my point. 

Smallest S&P 500 stock cap is 6.9B. Sounds like a mega cap to me.

S&P 500 P/E ratio is 26.9. Sounds like a growth fund to me.; Yep; Yes, for the same reason that people that already have $400k invested are going to remain invested. They're not going to sell and DCA back in over some arbitrary time period. Money is fungible and it doesn't matter where it came from.; I was confused because you said fees. Capital gains tax will have to be paid eventually in a taxable account, the rate you pay depends on your taxable income that year. I'd strongly recommend at least getting out of qqq and vug sooner than 15 years from now.

I assume you mean you originally paid 200k and that's why 1.1mm is profit, but that's not a useful way to think of it. You have an asset worth 1.3mm, but when you sell you'll have to pay for a new place to live and it's probably going to cost a lot more than 200k. Whatever value you can extract from that move can then be put towards other goals like funding retirement, but saying you have 1.1mm in profit gives you an inflated sense of how far that money will go once you add back in paying for a new living arrangement.

Before sorting out specifically how to invest you need to get a better idea of what the next couple decades will look like financially. Without that you can't know what your needs are and can't determine what your risk tolerance is.; Earning \~4.5% in a Vanguard money market account.  Not sure if there's anything better to do?; [deleted]; Because Vanguard doesn’t care what small investors need or want anymore.  In my opinion.; Buying a total market index fund like VTI is pretty basic and uncontroversial advice.  Financial advisors charge fees. For a small amount of money like 200k, the fees will greatly outweigh the value of any advice they could possibly give.  And since they’ve already figured out essentially the correct answer on their own, there’s a high risk that an unscrupulous advisor will steer them into an objectively worse high expense ratio investment to try to earn more in commissions in addition to their fee.  An honest advisor who isn’t going to screw you over probably doesn’t want a customer with just $50k, since a modest percentage of that isn’t worth much of their time or attention.; No one should take information they get from any social media site at face value.  Everyone is expected to do their own follow up research and verification.  That doesn't mean you don't ask questions and try to get ideas and feedback.; About what?  The OP seems interested in ""bogleheads"".  I suggested that she learn about what that means straight from the source instead of 2nd & 3rd hand.; No.  Bogleheads can be a very aggressive way of investing, for those for whom that's appropriate.

Mathematics doesn't become outdated.  Costs matter.  Diversification reduces risk w/out reducing expected returns.; What data are you referring to?; TIL, thank you!; Why are the fees different for the same index? 

Also, what does it mean that Mutual
Funds only trade once a day, after the market closes? Sorry if these are silly questions!; I understand what it sounds like to you but op might not know that its just your opinion.  I rather tell them what it is rather than what i think it is.; Thank you.; Thank you.

Yes, capital gains. This will be a high income year so I rather not pull during this year. Why out of qqq and vug before 15 years? Would love to hear your thoughts. 

We bought a house at $740k, put $200k down, and it will definitely sell at $2m. $1.1m is only the profit but it’s actually closer to $1.25 (need to figure out tax strategy on that! 😝) The new home would be similar to what we purchased, around $750-$850k and we’d use our original down payment amount there too. 

Loosely putting it out there - We want to retire with $5m minimum - that’s where the idea to pull the house profit and put it in the market now comes in. My husband will be contributing for the next 15 years to 401k, IRA. I have a condo that I will sell this year that will give me another $300k to invest. So, ball park if in the next 2 years we can get $1.8 million in the market for 13 years… how will we do?; Why Jan 1st? 
Isn’t the contribution for Roth IRA $7k annually each?; She literally said she got her advice from the bogleheads subreddit and then you said the bogleheads subreddit has no idea what a boglehead is. I’m asking you to explain what that accusation means.; Probably the data that says 66% of the time lump sum beats DCA; Different brokerages charge different fees.

Mutual funds don’t trade during the day. Once the market closes at 4pm EST, Mutual Funds update their NAV based on how the market moved that day and then their price adjusts. So if you were to buy FXAIX today at say 10am, the price you see is what it was as of yesterday’s market close. The price will update to todays price a couple hours after market close, so like 6pm, and then your order to buy FXAIX will execute. 

ETFs are the opposite. They trade during the market hours like normal stocks.; Keep it simple.; Qqq and vug are uncompensated risk, meaning they're more volatile, but don't have a proportionately greater expected return.

Volatility is talked about as risk because your return is more dependent on timing and it's impossible to predict reliably so a shorter time frame is less likely to h8ave a worthwhile return. There have bee crashes that the s&p500 took 10 years to recover from. When people talk about annual return like 7% or 10%, that's based on a 30 year average. The shorter the period you look at the larger the range of results. This is why I said you should already be thinking about less exposure to equities at 15 years out.

Putting all that money in the market in the next couple years might be fine, or it might go badly. With a longer time frame you can be more sure of a decent average return. I'm not saying don't invest the money, but remaining 100% in equities is basically saying you'd be OK with working an additional 5-10 years if necessary. Even if you decide to go that route, 5 years from retirement is the absolute max you should be putting off some kind of exit strategy.

I think you mentioned a target date fund. They will typically be aroudr 10% fixed income(bonds) and start increasing that % 10-15 years out drom the date until they're 40-50% fixed income at retirement. The idea is that you sell stock and buy bonds to lock in the gains you've already had so that a crash doesn't ruin your plans for being able to spend that money. For example, you're counting on being able to sell your house for 2mm. If you thought there was an uncomfortable likelihood of that dropping to 1.5mm in the next 2 years would you give up the chance that it increases further in value to guarantee being able to get 2mm 2 years from now?; 1.  That's not what I said.
2.  A lot of the advice on the Bogleheads subreddit doesn't match the Bogleheads Philosophy.  Some does; some doesn't.; Every time; That’s very helpful. Thank you!"
SoundHound AI Stock Tumbles as Margins Drop ,"Source: Investopedia

https://stocks.apple.com/A9QnHPEipTMOwtqq8D3gIsw

[ SoundHound AI (SOUN) shares plunged 16% Wednesday, a day after the provider of artificial intelligence (AI) voice technology software reported a big drop in gross margin. 


The Nvidia (NVDA)-backed company’s third-quarter GAAP gross margin sank 24.3 percentage points to 48.6%, and non-GAAP gross margin tumbled 14.0 percentage points to 59.7%. 


That offset an otherwise powerful financial report, with its loss per share of $0.06 beating the $0.10 loss per share expected by analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha. Revenue soared 89% year-over-year to a record $25.1 million, also above forecasts. ]",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gqnswr/soundhound_ai_stock_tumbles_as_margins_drop/,50,"This company actually went public? And their business model is ads? Why would anybody invest in this; 😆 took my profits and sold months ago; ""The Nvidia (NVDA)-backed company’s""

Really dislike this kind of thing.

Supermicro - hold or sell - my strategy,"Disclosure of related position: I bought Supermicro for my growth and momentum trading strategy back in January 2022 for $43.20 (split aligned $4.32) and then doubled down the 6th of September 2022 for $64.22 (split aligned $6.422). Then I partially sold 15th May 2023 at 137.19 (split aligned 13.719), 10th of January 2024 at  $355 (split aligned $35.5) and 12th of September 2024 at $442.13 (split aligned $44.231).

I took out already much more than I did put in, but still own a large position of SMCI. Now I'm in the process of changing the rule for a complete selling in my strategy. As you can see in my disclosure I left a lot of money on the table which already made me change the way I take partial gains.

But let's speak about Supermicro here. What happened:

Hindenburg took a short position and published a report about bookkeeping fraud at Supermicro. Then the auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned. The company is now behind on the mandatory reports to the SEC two quarters. This weekend is the deadline for a de-listing on the NASDAQ. The stock tanked 82% from the high. According to the actual published numbers (which may be corrected) the stock is now almost as cheap as when I bought it first, even if the value more than quadrupled still after the loss of 82%.

Now, Hindenburg at first only cited ex employees as source. But the resignation of Ernst & Young as auditor was probably an ace in Hindenburgs sleeve. I personally know Ernst & Young, they are not exactly my favorites. Since they published the report there was a mass of bad news published, the exact same analysts that hived Supermicro to the SP500 more or less exactly at the high say now it is junk after that loss.

I was thinking about Apple. In the time it would have been most profitable to buy everybody shouted sell. The stock lost more than once 80% of its market value.

Supermicro owns a lot of very unique patents. Their liquid cooled systems take less time to build and are more modular than any of the other competitors systems, Dell being its main competitor. Even if they reported some orders too early as sale they sell a lot lot more than a few years ago thanks to AI. And they will probably sell a lot more.

I think it is very possible that we cannot trade Supermicro on the Nasdaq next week. An that means it will fall out of the SP500 and the NASDAQ 100, putting a lot of sell pressure on the ETF that mirror those indices. Or, Supermicro presents a new auditor and a plan to deliver the reports to the SEC by this weekend.

It is probably a binary bet that will be resolved soon. In my opinion the upside (probability to win multiplied with amount to win) is much higher than the downside (probability to lose multiplied with amount to lose). And even if it is delisted, it is far away from being worthless. Probably it will be a target for Dell.

Here a [chart of Apple](https://www.tradingview.com/x/SDXjHW8c/) when it made most sense to hold them and when they lost a lot.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gqa9ht/supermicro_hold_or_sell_my_strategy/,40,"IMO, the way things have gone in the last 4-5ish years there's been enough mediocre companies or companies with problems that managed to turn into memes or rebound via other ways that were previously unheard of/unusual/uncommon. I think that's resulted in everything like the SMCI situation being viewed as an opportunity. 

Again, I have no idea what happens to SMCI but the last few years imo have made people a little too complacent about these sorts of situations. SMCI's auditor left (not a minor issue) and instantly that day tons of ""it must be a buying opportunity, right?"" posts.

IMO, we're eventually going to go back to bad is bad and not sure if it's this, but IMO eventually something genuinely bad is going to be looked at by enough people as a compelling gamble and it'll open up as a penny stock one morning.

___________________

Also ... I think people are forgetting that SMCI was actually delisted in 2018 for failing to file reports. https://ir.supermicro.com/news/news-details/2018/Supermicro-Announces-Suspension-of-Trading-of-Common-Stock-on-Nasdaq-and-its-Intention-to-Appeal/default.aspx

And that the CFO and company were charged by the SEC in 2020 with ""widespread accounting violations."" (https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020-190); I sold, better companies out there that actually go up; I don't own any stock in supermicro, but the company has been around since 1993 and it has manufactured computer parts for alot of other vendors. Working in the I.T field, their parts are seen in alot of appliances and servers over the years. I think they need to get some better management, and this company can do really good. I'm actually surprised what is going on.; I bought simply because reddit says it's done for. Worth the gamble.; equating apple with smci is simply fascinating. 

  
why not equate them with enro? or does that dispute your narrative that somehow delaying important filings and having no auditors is somehow fine?

  
without integrity, there's nothing; They filed another time extension, Q1 2025 10Q unable to proceed due to Q1 2024 10k not being filed... this looks doomed.; here is my scoop on SMCI:  

Current Situation is that SMCI’s down about 82% due to bookkeeping fraud claims, SEC report delays, and a possible NASDAQ delisting. Still, they hold patents and a solid spot in AI servers though so no need to panic just yet

Why Hold?? If SMCI sorts out SEC issues, the upside could be huuuge. Plus, you've already profited from past sales, so it’s less risky overall.

Why Sell?? Delisting and SEC issues are a lot of risk, and sentiment’s pretty negative rn.

Maybe sell part to lower risk but keep some in case it rebounds in the future

These days you can even get some decent stock analysis that also can digest news and official reports for you from AI tools. I like using Castello AI for financial stuff—they have a pretty cool subreddit too. I'd put a link, but I don’t wanna promote; they’re just a solid resource imo.; SMCI has a very healthy business. They will not sell themselves. They do have bad management and sales teams are disorganized. But again they have a very healthy business no matter what...; I’m in the same boat. Holding 10,000 shares with a big loss. I’m down about 65% on that investment. At this point, I’m betting it will not go down much further.. I’ll hold it for a few years and join the class action suits to recover some damages.; Damn this thing went up 40% after hours; I work as a buyer in electrical component distribution. I buy super micro products daily. Motherboards mostly for data center / AI servers. As well full barebones systems and chassis. Their products are in shortage and are in constant demand. I bought at $32 and I’m confident it will go back up.; Hindenburg is right 81% of the time btw. EY resigned, Deloitte left or was fired and BFA also organised a class action law suit. All of these organisations are wrong and SMCI is just misunderstood. You do you.; Fold; Supermicro could be the new Peleton. I’m not going to say it will happen, but right now it’s a giant risk, however the reward can also be big as the revenue stream still seems to be very high, and Nvidia can’t really use Lenovo, Dell and HP to launch their products at the same speed SM does.; They literally said a couple hours ago they cannot provide a new auditor or report by this weekend. Knowing this, whats stopping delisting?; What's baffling is that even last week after all the news the stock was flat on the 1 yr chart. And is only down 20% now.; Why did SMCI go up 30x above their previous highest price ever ($4 in 2015) between early 2022 and early 2024?  Is it just from building servers around Nvidia cards?  They're a good integrator but how much of a moat can they really have?; How much of an advantage is ""their liquid cooled systems take less time to build and are more modular than any of the other competitors systems"" when it comes to revenue and marketshare compared to say, Dell? Also, for Blackwell superpods liquid cooling is a requirement, not a differentiator between server/rack solutions, so I'm just not sure how much of a leg up SMCI has.

Per NVIDIA's [Press Release](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-blackwell-platform-arrives-to-power-a-new-era-of-computing):  
**""Cisco, Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo and Supermicro are expected to deliver a wide range of servers based on Blackwell products, as are Aivres, ASRock Rack, ASUS, Eviden, Foxconn, GIGABYTE, Inventec, Pegatron, QCT, Wistron, Wiwynn and ZT Systems.""**

That's A LOT of competitors offering similiar products. What makes SMCI so very special?  As a LT investor, I have missed a lot of gains on staying out of the hype train including SMCI, but also a lot of downsides as well. This feels very similar to when I asked ""What makes fastly so special?"" Turns out, nothing.

There are so many other names that have good momentum that fits the second half of the phrase: ""“in the short run, the market is a popularity contest but in the long run, it is a weighing contest.” In the long run, I don't think SMCI can grow that much--just like FSLY, AAOI, and so many others.

With that said, the market has done crazy things, so we all have to make our own decisions.; Hey bro, I want to start by saying its going to be alright either way. I'd advise against buying more SMCI but I'm no financial adviser. This post looks like what the reddit community calls ""Copium"". SMCI is likely never going to be a $1,000 ($100 post split) stock again. 

I've been a part of a lot of start-ups that benefited from being in lucrative industries early. Almost across the board, those companies are now a shell of what they once were. What happens is ego and human greed at the top level. That's very likely what happened here, considering the Founder is the CEO still. 

The guy probably let his head get massive and overspent / way over bonused himself and the company is loosing money / revenue is declining. Chasing after keeping the image of Growth, he probably instructed EY / his Finance team to lie in some Quarterly Reports. And now the chickens came home to roost.

E and Y is a big 4 accounting firm. Literally the best of the best in the whole world. Regardless of how you feel about them, they're good. At the same time, they're an accounting firm. Literally any company can have them do their books, and they'll do them, as long as you pay. There'd be no reason for them to cut that relationship unless something shady was happening. So something shady is probably happening. The reason they left is if EY started associating themselves with cooked books, it would destroy their brand once it became public knowledge. Its not a good thing if they have left. 

I'd imagine most of their recent Quarterly Reports were fraudulent. It's probably a lot worse of a company then all of us were led to believe. Its probably loosing clients very fast. The space is becoming very crowded and legacy IT giants are likely starting to do better than 1st to market companies like SMCI.

You can hold if you want,I understand that. Its a gamble, but its also reasonable. But do not buy more until you have a reason to believe this company's financials are actually legit.; Kind of absurd ur comparing SMCI to AAPL. just saying; Woup woup; Let it die dude, this stock is going to 0 just like spirit airlines.; They are likely going to be bought out by Intel. My guess is that someone will look at everything and buy this company on the cheap. The management is the problem. They have no guardrails in place to prevent fraud and need to be cleaned up. Bad luck happened when I bought it and to me that was the sign not to own.; >And they will probably sell a lot more.

Appreciate the analysis, but curious why you believe customers will still buy products from SuperMicro if they are delisted. Why would they take the risk of buying from a company that is untrustworthy? Is their product really head and shoulders above Dell? I know as an IT manager I'd have a hard time convincing my company to purchase SuperMicro products.

You make a good point about an acquisition. If they really do have valuable patents and technological superiority, and the stock is really as cheap as people suggest, a company like Dell might be interested. But then that would require a much more detailed audit that could reveal even more questions.

I'm an interested bystander, ready to pounce if this company does find a way out of this mess. But I wouldn't risk any amount of money on SMCI shares today, not while the market is offering up hundreds of other opportunities.; The problem now is not just that SMCI is probably fudging the numbers, it's also that NVDA has been diverting their deliveries to go to other companies. If SMCI isn't getting the chips, then there's no point investing in them.; IMO Maybe overusing IMO’s...; Yes, that is the nature of private investors holding stocks. But I do not think Supermicro is just a MEME stock. And I don't think a de-listing would be the end of the company, just look what happened after the last time.

Thank you for your post. It is very difficult to keep a neutral view when you are invested and already made that much money with it. So I welcome any different view.

I think the hardest part this time will be the exclusion from the SP500 and NASDAQ100. If that happens probably Hindenburg will cover from the many ETF that have to sell. If not there could be a squeeze. We will see...; 99% success rate strategy. i reckon you gain 300% in a couple years. HOLD; Actually I compared the situation with Apple for one only reason: **the best time to buy apple would have been when it lost 50-85% of its value**... more than once. Even if you bought before the decline you'd made tons of cash.

I never owned apple stock, but I did own Priceline that later acquired booking.com. I think my original entry price in the 90s was a few dollars ($2 maybe) and it's worth today like $5'000. So whatever more errors I did in my 44 years in the stock market, selling Priceline for a few 100% gain was probably the worst.

I want my strategy to avoid that. One can only lose 100% but gain thousands. But then thinking that I was up 2'000% in Supermicro at one point makes me a little angry. Lucky I sold already for more than my entry was, but all that money left on the table makes me think...; Wonder if the announcement is enough to not being de-listed...probably not.; Thanks, will check it out. Do they use Supermicro hardware? :); Very sorry to hear that. I had a good entry price and took out a nice sum so I cannot lose any real money on that trade. But all the nice booked gains are disappearing and that hurts too.

But remember: the morning is close when the night is darkest.

The hardware is found in many systems. But the owner did trust the wrong people, sales people try to sell at all costs and should therefor not be present in management.; Yes. Always bet against reddit 'experts' lol. They are wrong about pretty much everything; Why would the SEC delist them when they've granted them 1+ year's of extension in the past? Even when the company restated their financials, the changes weren't substantial, thus the paltry fines.; Why would the SEC delist them when they've granted them 1+ year's of extension in the past? Even when the company restated their financials, the changes weren't substantial, thus the paltry fines.; Yep. Ball is now at the SEC. I don't think they will de-list Supermicro because at least they came up with a communication in time. But you never know, Hindenburgs arms are long...; They had first mover advantage for liquid cooled Ai services.  They landed HUGE ($1B+) infrastructure build out deals with companies like Xai and Coreweave.  These deals were much bigger than anything they've had in the past.  Thus, the large run up in revenue.   Problem is that they don't have any real long-term advantages technologically.  Liquid cooling has been around a long time, and other companies will figure it out.   So ask yourself... will they continue to land the whales?; I must rely on other people here. But what I hear is they have a real advantage on liquid cooled systems and hold many patents in many different areas. The owner and CEO is an engineer but probably not the best manager. The transition from a family company to a Fortune 500 company is hard.

The company entered the SP500 more or less at it's all-time high and all the analysts were clapping their hands. Now they shout ""sell"" like always, after the fact. I just ignore that.; Why do you think E&Y is the best of the best? I had them as auditors for my own company and they would let me down for no reason. OK, my luck, I didn't pay their last excessive invoice after they let me down. And I am completely and absolutely sure that I did no wrongdoing in our bookkeeping. Hired a better and cheaper local auditor and never looked back.

In my opinion somewhere way up at E&Y and at Hindenburg there was a very quiet and very illegal deal. As in the last chapter of ""industry"": **cheat the cheater**.

After Market plus 17%, they will officially present their filings on Monday.; Probably in hindsight, yes. But then? 

There is an important difference: Supermicro declined in a bull market.

Rose 17% in after market, they will present their filings to the SEC on Monday.; How can a company with a massive amount of business go to zero?; Buyers do not care if company is on stock exchange. Most even don't know it. IT for a long time prefers supermicro hardware because it is the best quality/price performance there is in the market; That is actually not true; > But I do not think Supermicro is just a MEME stock.

I don't think it's a meme either but I think enough things have meme'd or otherwise rebounded unusually out of problems in recent years (large trucking company Yellow declared bankruptcy in 2023, then the stock went up 600% before losing all of that and then some) that people's instant reaction to something like an auditor leaving and not wanting to be associated with the company's financials now seems like it results in instant ""buying opportunity?"" posts.

IMO, too many people think after the last 4-5 years that every single negative announcement is a buying opportunity and in a lot of occasions they've been proven right. But when looking on a much longer time frame, I think the last 4-5 years have been unusual and there's a good chance we go back to more ""bad is bad."" That's all.

""And I don't think a de-listing would be the end of the company, just look what happened after the last time.""

No, but if it's delisted again for the same reasons at some point credibility in terms of the company's financial stewardship is going to be heavily/entirely eroded. They may have a great product, but if they get delisted a second time and return from that again, there's a decent chance there's going to be more hesitation then when the first time it happened.

""If that happens probably Hindenburg will cover from the many ETF that have to sell.""

I don't know that they're not already gone. I have a lot of respect for what they do, but imo it often feels like short sellers of that nature don't stick around in the manner that they used to as much and for good reason - it's been a much more difficult practice in recent years and too many people overstay there welcome and wind up facing a CVNA or to a lesser degree, something like CAVA.

You mention in the original post: ""As you can see in my disclosure I left a lot of money on the table which already made me change the way I take partial gains.""

I've always been someone who looks for longer-term holdings but it feels increasingly as if anything exciting that's working becomes a pile on much quicker, eventually becomes over-extended and then the escalator up often eventually turns into an elevator down. I've had a very good few years but the one common error that I've had on a few notable occasions was not taking profits on moves that turned out to be unsustainable and in those occasions, every time it's that escalator up over many months only to have that elevator down in a much shorter period.

""Thank you for your post. It is very difficult to keep a neutral view when you are invested and already made that much money with it. So I welcome any different view.""

Thanks! And again, nothing against what you're doing just some concerns more broadly about these sorts of situations. Hope it works out well for you.; You are focused on the wrong things. You need to ask ""Why"" did Apple lose 80% of its value. Hint: it wasn't because of potential fraud or cooking the books like with SMCI. Buying s stock just because the company is tanking is a good way to lose money.; honestly no idea, u gonna have to ask them directly .. they are pretty responsive on their subreddit; Every time I listen to their calls I think “why do they let this ceo talk” he needs to resign himself to chairman of the board and hire a top notch ceo. I will not sell now as I believe the company will survive this, but I do not expect to be green for years.; I did have some SMCI after EY quit as their auditor. But after they kept on dropping and I found out the CEO’s wife sits on the board and 2 companies that they do heavy biz with was the CEO’s bros or bro-in-laws, I sold it. That’s prob how they could manipulate their financial statements on the purchase n sales to those 2 companies. Too much family involvement. And wut they’re presenting to SEC on Mon is just a plan, not like it’s a 10Q or 10k and u don’t kno if they even found a major auditor who can check the books of a company their size. just saying..; No one is interested in buying stock in a fraudulent company. The business may continue but the stock will continue to drop and be removed from sp500 soon enough.; https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-nasdaq-nvda-moving-orders-away-super-micro-computer; People are just gambling hoping things will reverse.

Like the people who were investing in spirit.  They knew bankruptcy was likely. Then today they got fucked because they announced it.; >Does castello run un Supermicro hardware?  
I'm unable to provide specific information on whether Castello runs on Supermicro hardware, as there is no available data confirming this. If you have any other financial or market-related questions, feel free to ask!

At least he knows that he doesn't know nothing. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy); When stocks like DJT exist I’m not too sure; Same shit as people reporting that ""They cancelled their Malaysia office build out"".  There is so much bullshit news going around I don't know where to start. 

  
BTW - here is their cancelled Malaysia plant that they just posted about:  [https://x.com/Supermicro\_SMCI/status/1857117550225629242/photo/1](https://x.com/Supermicro_SMCI/status/1857117550225629242/photo/1); lol, yeah thats more of a technical question rather than a financial one; I mean how often does your president own a company that's publically traded? That's the only reason why it's around and not a penny stock.; my brother in christ that looks like a cgi rendering of what it is planned to look like. Phase one of a construction build typically means they've completed blueprints and design."
Did anyone on here invest when Apple was almost bankrupt? ,"What is the cheapest the stock got to when they were almost bankrupt before Steve Jobs returned to the company? I'm curious. 

I know most people would not have thought anything of Apple at that time and I'm pretty curious when sentiment was at its lowest. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gpllz1/did_anyone_on_here_invest_when_apple_was_almost/,120,"I worked for Apple in 03 and had the option to do an espp. My dad advised against it because he said he had no faith in the company and I believed him…..

Oh well. Live and learn.; cheapest it got was around $10, times were bad, the og Mac was over priced and not selling, they had no other winners and Dell compaq gateway etc etc were hitting sales records for desktops, the pepsi era was grim

at the time the only customers apple had was selling to college students and tech lovers, a very very small market, they were the kings of desktop publishing lol 

at the time I had $3k to my name and sat at my desk to write a check to a brokerage to buy something like 200 shares, back then there was no retail online anything other than compuserve, prodigy and AOL were just starting, also high commission due to small account

anywho I distinctly remember laughing at my self for thinking of doing something as stupid as buying 200 shares of a bankrupt company 🤔 I bought ibm instead

years later while watching how popular the og ipod was I thought about buying again but my thought at that time was there are dozens of mp3 players, this apple thing is a fad; Bought our first 1,000 shares of AAPL on 3/12/1997, a month after Jobs returned. 

Cost basis $4,000 at the time. 

I figured, “How many times does a fanatical workaholic visionary genius return to the company he founded in his garage after already changing the world three times (Apple ][, Macintosh, Pixar)? If it goes to $0, we lose $4,000. Not going to change our life in the slightest. But it could go up forever.”

It has. Those shares are currently up 154,434% plus dividends and are now worth $1,500,000, but we bought many, many more through the years and never sold one. 

The greatest turnaround story in the history of business.; Bought my cousin 4 shares of stock for high school graduation.  2 shares of Microsoft, a touch under $50 per share.  2 shares of apple, roughly 0.50 per share.  

He never sold, value of apple was $20,000+ last I looked.  

Imagine if we had only bought $100 in all apple shares.; I bought it in January 2005, still have it.; I have 1000 shares with a basis of $37.50; In the enterprise space - Apple was never a consideration. And my recollection is that general sentiment at the time is that Apple is a consumer grade product which would become crowded. And there were lots of other successful tech companies. We were also seeing a lot of consolidation back in the early '90's and Apple at the time did not believe in growth by acquisition (at least until they acquired NeXT). 

One of the things that people like me never liked about Apple is that it's a closed ecosystem - so it was never a company that I would invest in because I believed that tech companies cannot grow if the company limited third-parties from contributing to innovation. 

It's easy to look in the rear view mirror today - but back then - there were lots of companies that never made it out of the '90's and '00's. Companies like Nantucket, Aston Tate, Lotus, Borland, Novell, Prodigy, AOL, AskJeeves, etc. 

I like to mention AskJeeves because it was an idea that showed the promise of AI and chatbots.; Bought in early 2002 after seeing a friend’s iPod and being amazed. I was in high school lucky to make $100/week and dumped $2000 into it. That has paid for a down payment on a house, a masters degree and still have about 50% of it. My experienced investor dad tried so hard to convince me to sell and diversify and my dumb teen self rebelled and refused. Turns out that particular rebellion was a worthwhile one.; Who wants to buy at lows when you can buy at highs?; I bought $1000 in 1997. I believed in Apple. Great towers like the 9600/200 (mhz!). 

My plan at the time was to use that $1000 investment to fund my new Apple computers for the next 10 years. So I did. Until all the shares were gone by 2010. 

I stuck to my plan and executed it, so I cannot feel bad.  Hey, I didn’t lose money.; No, but worked for Apple during the summer of my first year in college. This was 98. I remember them pitching how we could buy shares at a discount. Nope I said, this company won’t be around much longer.  I drank that money instead.; God I wish I had. I really thought about throwing some money at it when it was in danger of being delisted but talked myself out of it because it was “obviously about to fail”.; I did .  Bought AAPL very early on for mid 20s and sold it at loss (high teens), when I heard from employees got retrenched.  I don't regret and had to do what we had to do.; I didn't.  They were in bad shape in the mid 90s.  Pretty sure Microsoft saved them at some point with an investment of some sort.

Easy to look back and dream.  No one would have guessed this success so it doesn't bother me.; When Microsoft invested in Apple in the ‘90s and ended the bankruptcy threat it was eye opening to me.  You’d assume MSFT would be happy for Apple to disappear at that time but reality was turning out quite different.  It made me think Apple had a better chance than Wall Street realized and it wouldn’t be allowed to fail (ironically, due to Bill Gates).  That was my trigger to put some money in and it’s been a nice ride so far.; One of the few things I did in my miserable motherfucking investing life was, make a large investment in Apple when the iPhone was announced. “Large” was something like $30,000 maybe. But at 10x’ed informed one of the pillars of my sorry, investing life.

Did I buy more on the way up? Of course not, because I already owned some apple. Did I pay attention to the 200 day moving average and by when it got above it or so when it got below it? Of course not.; I told my boss in 1998-99 that Apple at $7 is really good and we should invest in it. I got busy with work and never bought it and neither did my boss. Fast forward I said the same thing about Amazon at 60$. I got busy with work never bought it but my client who I told this to bought 1000 shares and rode it up all the way to 3500. Oh well; Yes, I bought back in 2002 with split adjust cost now $0.43 per share (current price $224). I've held much of this and done very well, though unfortunately have sold shares over the years, so only have about half my original amount. I actually sold a small amount this past year as now taking profits, I am obviously very over-weighted in AAPL and I think other opportunities may do better going forward.

I've always liked and used Apple computers (Macs) since the 1980's, so this really paid off.; Please don’t remind me.  My wife bought me a first gen iPod for Father’s Day  and I thought to myself maybe I should buy some stock. We got a inground pool instead.


There was good reasons not to invest as I remember. We got burned with what little we had invested in Tech in the 90s.  Kids loved that pool though.; I had such bad experiences with Apple when trying to use their machines for engineering research applications that I assumed that they wouldn't make much of what little market share that they had with their computing platforms.  I wasn't completely wrong with this, but the IPhone was a sea change and the real key (along with Jon Ive's design chops and very savvy marketing creating the fanboy world) to their wild growth post 2007/IPPhone intro.; I had 300 sharess  when Microsoft bailed them out .. I sold within one week after that news broke..; I remember when an Apple employee told my parents to buy their stock because they were making the iPhone. 

My parents didn’t. 😂; Why you bring this up?

I was an Apple tech in SF in the 90's before Jobs came back. The stock was trading at less than $20.00.  I had 10k saved up and put it toward a house instead. That investment turned out fine, but still wish I'd bought some.; Not the ""bankruptcy"" days, but I bought some AAPL when the first Iphone came out. Everyone was talking about it and it seemed like the company might grow. And wow what a ride. Still holding. After all the splits, my basis is now approximately $5. 

I wonder if any company today will grow like they did.; I bought in 2007 after I tried an iPhone. I’ve held ever since. Not life changing amount (I was young then) but good portion of my retirement Accout (probably over weighted); I have a client with a $3k basis that is now worth a half million dollars. He also bought Nvidia 10 years ago and never sold. Dude has an extra $1.5M in his account because he just threw darts at the wall; more Nvidia than apple. His Nvidia reasoning was that drones were the way of the future and Nvidia would be the supplier for drone companies; I bought 100 Apple in 1981. They sent me the share certificates home.  Sold a couple of years later.  Doubled my money. 🥲; I bought at $8 a share; I bought $1000 worth of Apple stock a month before Jobs returned out of pure luck.  I was a longtime believer in the company and had no idea he would return.  I sold it a couple months later at 100% profit.  No one here ever believes me but no regrets as I made more money over the years with the sale proceeds than if I held.  Still would have been easier if I held but I wouldn’t have the things I do now due to timing issues.; Sentiment was horrible. They weren't putting out competitive computers. The CEO at the time decided to start pushing colorful Imacs thinking pretty things would compete against technologically better things. I know a lot of people disagree, but I feel like they just continued that sentiment once Steve Jobs took over, they just refined it. 

Moore's law determined everyone's stock price in computers back then. Intel was King and AMD was a scrappy underdog who made processors that could double as toasters.

Nobody really expected Apple to do much of anything because they were completely bailed out by Microsoft and the only reason Microsoft bailed them out was to help against all of the antitrust issues that they were having. They were literally propping up a competitor as a sock puppet to prove they weren't the only game in town. Apple as a brand was the back corner of the computer store, quite literally.

The short version is, you wouldn't have invested in them either at that time.; In early 2008 my GF at the time got $50k given to her by her dad and she asked me where to invest it.  I told her to park it in Apple which was under $100 at the time.  She didn’t.  Would be worth around $3.4M today; You’d have been brave. They were turning out some absolute gash hardware, even though their OS was good.; nearly put $3000 in 1994; Not the same time frame, but I bought in 2007 and panic sold in 2009. 

On a positive note, I made all the noob mistakes when my net worth was in the thousands. Those lessons made me avoid the land mines during the pandemic and just DCA into ETFs; Fun story, back when itunes first came out I told my dad who was a investment person about how 99 cents a song is awesome because I would go to record stores and have to buy an entire album just for a few songs I liked. He said they it wouldnt be worth investing in apple because they were in the dumps and how they fired steve jobs and etc. He didnt like reminding him of how it was a stupid idea NOT to buy the stock back then. 😃; we had apple 2+ in school, 1982; I still have it with an average of $10 a share excluding the dividends I’ve received al these years; My in laws have been in since the start. Same with Starbucks.; I bought right before the iPod released and it was around $13 a share.; Yup. Still holding some stock from around 2003.; I did! Apple was the first stock I ever bought, back in 1998. Bought 100 shares for $3000 when Steve became CEO again. A lot of money for me at the time, but I believed! The stock promptly dropped down to $8. A few months later, Apple struck a deal with Microsoft, who needed Apple to stay in business as part of its monopoly settlement. Stock promptly shot back up to $30 and I was very happy to sell. After the dot com crash of 2000, it dropped back down to $6 and I felt lucky to have gotten out. It would be worth $4-5 million today.; I bought $3000 in 2002ish @ $17.23. Thought iPods would be a thing.; My parents are in AAPL at something like $24/share. Retirement is going well for them.; I bought at a split adjusted $0.25/share.; I had bought a bunch in early 2002 at something like $4/share (pre split adjusted). 

Unfortunately my wife works for a Big 4 firm and they won the Apple audit business a couple of years later and we were required to sell the shares (no one that works for them can own it). 

Having done the math, that has costs us multiple 7-figures.; Cheapest stock I’ve got was AAMRQ when they were going bankrupt for an avg of $0.32 and I sold it all after it changed to AAL for ~$55. Best $5k I’ve ever spent.; I bought 200 shares in 2005.; I have some shares at $5 split adjusted; [removed]; I swear I bought some Apple in about 2005, but I probably sold the old shares off when I needed cash to pay for something. I still have many shares going back to 2012. By letting them sit there in a drip, I have made $60K.

Edit to add the current cost basis is about $37.; no I am a poor person; I went to Siggraph the year Jobs returned to Apple. He was a last minute addition to speak. As a starving college student I had no cash to buy stocks and this was before E*trade and the like so it wasn’t exactly easy. 

I told anyone who would listen they should buy some shares. I think it was like $7-ish a share or something in the neighborhood of ¢35 account for splits. ; I started buying after the first ipod.. around 20 21; I am investing in Joby and ACHR and they are burning cash... But it's gonna fly; I bought Apple at $98/share right after the 2008 crash.; Green Mountain Coffee Roasters ($GMCR) around 2009-10 just as Keurigs were getting hot.; Yes, I invested just before it started rising. Unfortunately, it wasn’t Apple I invested in. It was palm pilot.; 2011.. wife bought a few shares.. still have them.

Nothing compared to some folks who bought much lower, but has turned out pretty well.; I owned apple back in the early to mid 80’s..  it was when IBM PCs were bashing the hell out of apple and I watch the stock slide down..  maybe $13 IIRC…. 

When it made it back up to my buy in price, I sold it….  Obviously never became an apple fanboy so I never got on board with iPods, phones etc….  End of story; The last time I checked on my Apple I was up something like +407% give or take a few points. I don't even pay attention to it. I just let the automatic DRIP do its thing.; The lesson is, always gamble on stocks in case they blow up.; my parents worked for/with apple in the 70s-90s and were compensated with a lot of stock. they sold almost all of it off over the late 90s and early 2000s before the ipod came out because they were disillusioned with the company and the leadership. iirc I checked a few years ago when apple first hit $1T market cap and it would have been worth something like $50m+ dollars.; Me too dude! I was working there when we did OSX and the stock was at 6$ a share, but I was too young to gamble with my money. I don’t think people realize that we didn’t always get paid ridiculous salaries at that time.; I want to say my parents were interested in investing in Walmart in the mid 80s, but their broker advised against it. Looks like it's gone up 20,000% since.

Speaking of Apple though, this post sparked up memories when we were running MacOS on non Apple hardware in the late 90s prior to Jobs reorganizing everything. Unheard of today!; In your dad's defense, an ESPP on any arbitrary company would have on average underperformed the S&P 500 over the past 20 years.

You just happened to work at one of the few companies that massively out-performed it, but hindsight is 20/20 and you can't beat yourself up over decisions you made based off knowledge you didn't have at the time.; I had to check this one. Apple was $0.33/shr adjusted in 11/2003, and $224 today.; Buy when others are fearful; If there's one thing I've learned, it's to never trust anyone in older generations on tech investments.

I invested TSLA when they were very new at $30, and on the advice of someone 30 years older than me (a co-worker), I cashed it out at around $125. He said ""well I think you've made enough on your original investment.""

I very quickly realized my mistake and bought it all back (and more) and then sold it years later for an insane 1,000%+ profit, but I was young and naive and thought it best to trust someone merely because they were older than me, when that person knew nothing about investing.

The lesson for me? I learned to trust my own intuition and research over anyone else's casual advice.; People also forget during the iPod craze, there were many other mp3 players on the market. The original iPod also only worked on the Mac platform. It wasn't an obvious runaway with Apple. The iPhone stage was also masked by the fact almost everyone in business used a Blackberry, many said they would never switch from a tactile keyboard to one on screen. It's not always as obvious in the moment as it is looking back.; Those early iPods were absolutely terrible and I hated even trying to use them whenever a friend showed me theirs. I also hate the Apple TV remote, and love Roku's remote design.

Yet people have some weird fascination about Apple products like they must inherently be better; or they'll be judged as poor for not having them. 

iPhones are pretty solid though, I'll grant that. Still happy with my Pixel.

And my Grandma is living off the Apple shares she bought 20+ years ago.; $10, not adjusted for splits; How do you control yourself to not sell? I tend to be stuck in between thinking I'm holding for long term and then selling as soon as I hit say 50% return just to lock in profit. Been burnt by crypto so much I just take profits whenever I can, but long term might not be a good approach.; Nice. What kind of dividends are you making on AAPL?; Wow, how many?; My cost basis is $30.45. Unfortunately, I only have 62 shares.; I remember. I was a huge Microsoft guy. My dad bought a Hewlett Packard back then and then got me one. I was a gamer back then so I remember I got a Hewlett Packard with an Nvidia graphics card to play Terminal Velocity, Doom, & Descent. I hated they were a closed ecosystem back then because if I bought an Apple Mac back then I couldn't play my games and thought it was more expensive anyways.

I remember AskJeeves also. I used to use that one and Yahoo! back in ........ 1997-98 I think it was. When Google came out I vividly remember my computer 1 teacher telling me about this really good search engine called ""Google"" that was better than Metacrawler which is what I used. I never went back to Metacrawler when I learned about Google.; How is dad today?; [deleted]; Nothing to feel bad about. That’s money you would have spent anyway, and that’s what investments are for. It’s just reallocating funds. Other thing you should be proud of is you had a specific exit plan that you stuck with. Most people don’t even have an exit plan.; I feel like stocks are like that. When Netflix was losing subscribers people all the sudden considered them low quality shows.... All of the sudden. Boy if you go into them back then also lol I guess the equivalent would be a company like Intel... I can't think of anything else right now that has gotten annihilated by losing market share and everything. Not saying there's any hope or that they're going out of business but it's sometimes impossible to see a company return to a strong presence.


When did you start buying shares? In my mind I probably wouldn't have bought when they were going out of business either..... maybe when the iPod came out. When that came out it was a huge deal. I'm not an Apple guy. I'm more of a Microsoft person but even I bought that and still never had a Zune. Almost ended up buying into the Apple ecosystem back then also.; At the time I was hard-core in the Apple ecosphere, buying a power Mac 7500 with money I had made for my side business selling anime products, which eventually turned into a serious business that we’ve been running for 30 years so far. My wife was floored that I had made enough money to buy a whole computer.

So I was quite in touch with what was good or wasn’t good about Apple at the time. We all knew, whatever happened, we would never stop using Apple products, even when they were quite shitty.; Today they saved OpenAI; So... what's that next company you won't take time to buy being to busy?; I'd bought $2000 worth of AAPL in May 2007: sold it in December 2011, sad; Lady fortuna; Those colorful Macs (the original iMac) was a part of Jobs’ comeback. The other big thing he did was cut down the number of product lines, which had spiraled out of control and was extremely confusing to customers, to just 4 (consumer desktop/laptop, pro desktop/laptop).

The appeal of the iMac (and later iBook) wasn’t that they were powerful, but that they had been simplified as far as technologically feasible at that point and the fastest way to get onto the internet — they had an ad campaign talking about how the iMac needed only two cables to connect to the internet for example. The iBook was also among the very first consumer-oriented laptops to be equipped with WiFi, where in the PC world that was found only in higher end models or bolted on with a bulky PC Card upgrade.

While Apple wouldn’t start shooting upwards in popularity until years later when the iPod gained Windows compatibility, the product line simplification and introduction of the iMac/iBook at least put the company in a position where it could keep its head above water after the floaty that Microsoft tossed them had dissolved.; I remember showing the 1st gen iPod to my dad. He could not understand why I was so exited. I tried to explain and told him to buy some stocks. He didn't obviously... neither did I but I was 18 with no much money at a time when buying stocks was not as easy as today. Even less for us Europeans. I like to remind him of that day and I guess I should have invest in Apple instead of the ipod which was something like 500 EUR back then.; Should have sold it to your mom or dad; Your submission was automatically removed because it contains a keyword not suitable for /r/investing.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/investing) if you have any questions or concerns.*; I liked Apple Macs. The first I used IIRC was Macintosh II. I played the hell out of Oregon Trail. When I asked my teacher if I can borrow the game he asked if I owned an apple and didn't understand why. Never bought a Mac. I did have an iPod and almost got a Mac but really to this day it's just I was always a fan of Microsoft more when it came to technology. When that rivalry was going on and that commercial came up with Apple/Microsoft as people (Apple was the laid back guy, Microsoft was the computer nerd) I felt attacked.... even though yes I was a computer nerd EASILY lol; That’s why I’m in etf’s now 🤣 i can’t pick a winner to save my life.; 100% my takeaway; Just think how much Steve Wozniak lost; And it wasn't like you could just buy stock on your phone. You had to call Charles Schwab or go to a physical office.; And if you had 100k in your brokerage account back then, how much would you put in Apple?; Hacintosh?; I had one of those. It was called a “Power PC”; That’s why I laugh about it. The chances of me holding it all these years were slim to none too. It’s a fun story though; 224 with their stock splits in 2014 and 2020 I think it was lol would have been crazy. I guess you never know.

I wanted to ask this because we were talking about how much market share Intel lost.; Damn. When I worked at a Fortune 100, I bought like $200 of stock via their ESPP every month.

Assuming a similar amount of investing, that’s about 400 shares every year. Just from that first year it would’ve been $89,000 of investments.; Calculate historical Apple purchase at today's share price

https://finlo.io/stock-calculator/AAPL; The lesson is you lucked out; I remember swearing I’d never leave my Windows mobile with a keyboard. I insisted a full keyboard was the only way I’d ever operate a cellphone…; I would say it’s mostly that Apple products really click with some people at the cost of not appealing to others. It’s not a conventional strategy, but it’s evidently working based on the money they’re raking in.

The status/judgement thing happens, but the crowd that totes around an iPhone as a status symbol only has a relatively small intersection with those who just like the products and I think it’s good to keep that distinction in mind.; >Those early iPods were absolutely terrible

Huh? Their hardware design was incredible. It was a Porsche in the time where everything else was a AMC Gremlin.; I don't need the money. We sell a few hundred shares every year to fund our lifestyle now that we're retired, but with dividend re-investment, they are replenished soon enough. 

We also bought our first share of Berkshire Hathaway in about 2000, when it was ""only"" $68,000/share. Now we own four, and it's at $700k.

Like Buffet says, ""My preferred stock holding period is forever.""

Buy and hold.; AAPL pays $0.25/share (0.45%) quarterly. With our 33,000 shares, at the current share price of around $225, we get around 140 free shares every year.; $250 / $1.15~; This is the part of investing that frustrates me to no end. Even if you can afford to get in at the right time, it’s still basically worthless if you can’t afford large sums. 

Takes money to make money.; Descent was my favorite video game. 

It's interesting that you mentioned you had a Nvidia card. Back in the '90's - the darling graphics card company was ATI which went public in the early '90's at least 5 years before Nvidia IPO'd. 

The problem with AAPL also is that there were a lot of high-end workstation companies that could have started to put out a consumer grade workstation. If companies like Sun, Apollo, SGI, (maybe even DEC) started to enter the consumer market - we may have seen a very different tech landscape today. 

I always thought that the attempt by NeXT to bridge consumer and high-end workstation market was interesting. I had a NeXT workstation which I enjoyed working on.; Funny thing, for a few years in the 90s Macs shipped with a copy of an enhanced (resolution bumped to 640x480, new CD-quality soundtrack) version of Descent included. The Performa tower my parents bought in 1996 had it and it ran well.; All good! Diversification treated him well and every once in a while I get a jab in about how I’ve outperformed him in the markets.; Not at all, worked my ass off and kept saving. Just had an opportunity to buy a house younger than I would have mostly and will have the chance to retire much earlier than if I had skipped the investment overall.; Intel is a good one for the moment.

Nike is another. Has been totally decimated and it’s hard to see light at the end of the tunnel. 

Ford is another. Their stock is absolute trash but they could perhaps find an “iPhone” and turn it around.; Ha ha.; Intel maybe; Jobes also switched from the motorola micoproceesor they were using to Intel micorprocessros.  At the time apple started the motorola processor was one of the best on the market.  But IBM went with intel and IBM closes also used intel.  So intel got a lot of money that allowed they to rapidly improved the processor.  And many design software progams Needed to faster intel chips.  switching chips was not easy the the circuit boards have to be redesigned and the software had to be rewritten.  to be compatible with the new chip.  with that change the performance of apple computers took a big jump up in performance.; I didn't remember that the colorful imacs was jobs. It was seemingly a seriously dumb move to sell pretty as opposed to powerful at that time. It has been awhile so my memory isn't obviously the best, but the rest is pretty true. Apple at the time looked like it was going to fade from view like the Amiga. Important a long time ago, and fading into obscurity.; Yeah, had I known that would have made sense. But at the time (this was pre iPhone) I was fine having made a small profit and moving on. Was annoying but not like this.

This also assumes I would have held it the entire time. Not sure that would have been the case.; At the time , Gateway computers and Compaq were hot lol.; Way before Hackintosh. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe Hackintosh is getting OSX to run on non Apple x86 hardware. I was referring to the clones that were available in the mid 90s. Power Computing was a popular brand that we ran in our office at the time. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_clone looks to cover it. That was a long time ago, so my memory is a little vague :D; Partially, yes - I won't deny that.

But my action in re-investing after quickly realizing my mistake is what saved me. Had I blindly listened to his advice I'd have made 3 figures as opposed to 5. All a matter of perspective, I suppose.; Agree with this. It was so elegant compared to other products in the category at the time.; Amazing story.  Thank you.  Congratulation. You are one of the smartest people I know.; Fantastic mate. Congratulations and well done!; Probably my biggest takeaway when I began investing 10 years ago as well; I bought my 1000 shares on a monthly investment over a few years, I have it as low as $21.25. This was not a lump sum purchase; Actually RKLB andHOOD  are probably better choices..; My point is that people with money tend not to put that much in dicey stocks. I have a friend who had perhaps a million in the late 90s who put 5k in Microsoft and 5k in another company that went bankrupt. Now the 5k in MSFT is over 100k. The 5k in the bankrupt company went to zero, so 10k went to 100k in 26 years.; I remember we had one that was able to boot to Mac or windows 3.1, very strange.; So what is your exit strategy on tsla? Or are you planning to hold it forever?; Right place, right time. 

I learned the “it can only go to zero, but it can go up forever” from my dad. 

He bought $400 of Chrysler stock for $0.25/share the night before the US Government bailed them out. He said, “It’s an election year and Chrysler has 380,000 union workers. The government is NOT going to let them go out of business. It can only go to $0.00, but if it does and they are in bankruptcy, I am at the front of the line as a secured creditor. It can go up forever.” 

Then a young guy named Lee Iacocca was put in as CEO. All he did when he was at his old job at Ford was design the Mustang. A year later, Lee introduced the K-Car and the minivan. He was on TV ads telling buyers, “If you don’t love it, I’ll buy it back.” 

Chrysler stock went to $68/share by the time my dad sold in retirement for a cool 27,000% gain and $108,400 in profit, plus dividends.; Another example is Ford during the 2008 recession. 

Their stock went to $2/share. They were the only one of the Big 3 who didn’t take a government bailout, and they had the best-selling vehicle in North America for 40 years running — the F-150. They were not going to go out of business. 

We bought $12,000 worth for $2/share and collected dividends for the past 16 years. 

It’s now at $11 and still pays a 5.4% dividend. Our $12k is worth $45,000 now. Wish we had bought more.; Maybe Robinhood but not Rocket Labs. 

Robinhood is only a few points above it's historical lows. Rocket Labs is above its IPO and not too far away from the ATH.

Meanwhile, Apple in 2003 was down over 60% off it's high in 2000. No one was expecting it's absolute dominance coming from a total redesign to it's infrastructure and product offerings. Apple's rise was really something for the ages. In retrospect, it was simple and brilliant, but few companies have actually turned things around in such a way.; Great insight. Thanks; Sold it - bought a car with it (not a Tesla, ironically); Both stories only support the fact that you are one of the smartest people I know. For everyone one story you publish I have 2 stories of terrible errors I made selling to quickly or making stupid risks.  Like today I want to short some stocks but earning potential is only 100% and Warren buffet says never go against the market. Buying stock can earn more than 100%.  

If I would have just purchased VOO from day one or never sold any one of my stocks I would be sitting as good as you. I would be retired today.; True about RKLB, but they are a long-term play as their industry is nascent and they have extremely skilled leadership.

Robinhood has a reputational problem that will take many years to recover from (Nike and Ford for example still have good reputations generally speaking). Not sure if Robinhood has the right leadership in place.; The real insight is that while the msft did well, it didn’t have a big effect on his portfolio. It was the other 990k that mattered. Think about the 990k. If you’re only willing to put 1% in something, don’t bother.; Right, but neither of those are industries like Apple in 2003.

In 2003, Apple was a niche home computing company, with even smaller B2B division. It had resurrected its profitabilty by reducing its offerings, not really expanding. 

But... it had recently just released the iPod (a novel, but lackluster product) and then the iTunes Store. Suddenly, it had a cash cow that revolutionized the game and went on to develop the market that would become dominated by the iPod. Then the iPhone and App Store shortly afterwards.

It's hard to say in 2003, that Apple would've been that behemoth and back then someone on a thread like this would be saying something like ""look at what the company has produced in the last 23 years: lackluster performance.""

So, in a way, for the closest comparison we should be looking at a company that's about 25-30 years old, IPOed about 20 years ago, and has just recently returned to profitability and released new products within the last 2 or so years, that might just go on to develop a whole new market space."
NVDA has become the largest position in retail portfolios in the first half of the year,"Data on the 15 most widely held stocks and ETFs in retail portfolios and sorted by weight, NVDA tops the list with a 9.3% weighting over other popular stocks. Such as Apple, S&P 500 EFT, Tesla, Nasdaq 100 EFF, Meta, and others.

This compares to NVDA's 4.2% weighting in the average retail portfolio a year ago

NVDA's popularity is largely due to its rapidly rising stock price, earnings reports that have repeatedly beaten expectations, and retail investors' preference for tech stocks - over the past year, NVDA's stock price has risen 203%, and in the second quarter, NVDA's revenues of $30 billion were up 15% sequentially and 122% year-on-year, well above the $28 billion estimate",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gp0l4n/nvda_has_become_the_largest_position_in_retail/,216,"NVDA is also the largest company in the S&P 500 now; If the stock tripled this year, the stock will become a larger position so 4.2% into 9.3% is pretty spot on to account for some sales.; I'd say. My initial investment in Nvidia that I had not sold was about $900 (made sometimes in maybe 2014-15). That is now 200 shares. It's by far my single largest position by a huge margin.; I wanted to buy Nvidia way back. But I also wanted a new gaming pc. I bought a gtx 680 instead.

If I had put that 680 money into the stock..... I'm gonna go drink.; Rug pull coming soon. The world hates retail investors; Yea I stepped in this spring, should have years ago, I’m a knot head; Where did you get this info?; Not that I’m complaining, didn’t plan for it to be such a big percentage of my portfolio… I bought early though and not planning to sell till retirement.; I rotated out of tech last week. This shits about to go timber so hard.; Time to buy puts on nvda 😮‍💨; Makes sense. My personal opinion is that it's overvalued but there's so many retail investors buying it regardless, and it's weighted highly in many popular ETF's causing the price to continue rising as everyone stocks up on them. It falls into a lot of etf categories.; Why wouldn’t it be; This is gonna end so badly.; The new stars now are tsla and pltr.; Yeah; Same; You bought in early; I was thinking to do the same. Instead, I bought a gtx 1070, lol ; Same boat…really wish I bought more back then. Bought in like 2017. With the stock splits I’m at 200 shares with an avg cost of ~$4 a share; Was curious so looked it up. 680 launched March 22, 2012 for $500. NVDA was $0.33 that day.

If you bought MVDA shares instead of the 680 it’d be worth $220k.; So choices matter don’t they.  lol; We need to stick together; Don’t worry man I’m still holding 20k nvda; It’s not a bad thing that you bought early at a low cost and large percentage 
The most important thing is value; Wouldn't be so sure of this. Tech is very much still the future and unless something unexpected happens I think we are still on an upward path; Yeah; Really?; Not a bad strategy as long as it's not too far down since it goes up and down; I've been considering it for earnings on the 21st. I think expectations are so high that they could drop on even great numbers. I'm just hoping to see a fomo rally leading up to earnings before I pull the trigger.; It’s kind of like buying bitcoin, only it’s tied to an actually useful tech.; Yeah it’s the most popular stock among retail investors; Why ? Their earnings are good. The growth can slow down a bit but they keep growing.; Maybe; rddt; Correct pltr I’ve been following since October; AMD, next year! 


People will shun it now @ 150. At 300, it'll be popular. At 500, it'll be #1 position in retail portfolios.. just like NVDA is now.


Btw, pls share the source of the data. Wondering who #2 and #3 are.; Everyone thinks so.  lol; How many GTX680 can you get for 220k?; That is some cryptocurrency level gains for a company that was quite well established at that time already, wtf.; I am a dope, I held my amd shares in the gpu wars knowing nvda was stiff competition…yesh; Dont let anyone else know, they might drive the price up.; Tech is still the future I agree; People said the same thing before dotcom.

Tech is valued at GFC levels right now.; I mean everything else pumped like crazy after the elections but nvda fr I was expecting that to run up it gotta be something why they didn’t dump into it; I don’t think there’s much to worry about; You’re right; I am betting on this long term.  I'm not really concerned about this going up or down short term.  

It's been going up really well.  Started rocky.  I think their next earning will slow down a bit.  I see the ads now are not mostly from big companies.  Some no names I don't even know compared to last month.  

I want to add PLTR but not really sure yet.; These two stocks have been going up last week and this week.  Reminds me a bit of nvdia run up earlier this year.  

Not sure about PLTR but TSLA hasn't shown any signs of slowing down yet.

I see a lot of articles on yahoo finance about these two stocks.  I even see PLTR being compared to NVDA.

I've been watching these 2 everyday.; problem is, AMD isn't nearly as useful atm. They're lagging behind in AI useability.


Trying to catch up but... not there yet and not sure when that'll happen if it happens.; AMD won’t scale revenues as much as Nvidia and isn’t as profitable. Their GPU margin is about 54% compared with about 75% for Nvidia; You guys are confirming what I wrote. Skepticism @ 150.. I'll watch the narrative change 180 degrees next year.

RemindMe! 1 year.; Let’s just say it takes time; Like at least 3; Yea nvda is more popular; What catalyst would cause this ""crash"". You reference the GFC, which was a domino effect of the mortgage crisis. Tech is flying high but the sales back up the valuations, in many companies, not all.; I'm guessing the tariff plans may have gave Nvidia some brakes but it is kinda high; Many articles are very bullish on PLTR at the moment 
It seems to be backed by government money

Next year will be mostly TSLA and NVDA.  and maybe PLTR if it keeps performing well.; Trust him bro.; There’ll be another chance; Do you hold them too?; Honestly I'm still undecided.  It's hard to tell since we are in a bull market.  Especially now that Trump won.  Most of the stocks are really high up.  Hard to filter the noise.  

I'm just gonna observe.  I remember my co workers got burned last time this went up and they exited at a lost.  That's what usually happens if you are not familiar with how the company works/operates.  They get scared when the stock goes down.; Yeah this is both an opportunity and a risk"
US Tech Stocks will push back against EU pressure as Trump signals tariffs and 'America First' policies,"Honestly, it feels like Apple and the whole US tech sector are finally standing up to the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) and all the over-the-top regulations. With Trump hinting at tariffs and pushing that ""America First"" vibe, the U.S. tech giants might finally have the leverage to say ""no thanks"" to a lot of the stuff Europe’s trying to force on them. The DMA is supposed to keep things competitive, but for companies like Apple, it’s just restrictive and honestly impacts their ability to innovate. If the U.S. government throws its weight behind them, these companies could really start pulling back from Europe’s grip and go about their business without being bogged down by EU red tape.



Europe’s supposed to be an innovation hub, but it’s really starting to look like the opposite. For startups, the endless admin, complex regulations, and sky-high taxes make it pretty much impossible to thrive. You have great ideas coming out of Europe, but the bureaucracy and costs just suffocate them before they can take off. Compare that to the U.S., where taxes are lower and there’s way less red tape, and you can see why so many are ditching Europe altogether. It’s like the EU’s digging its own grave when it comes to tech innovation, and the U.S. might be there to pick up the pieces.

But as a human being, a little bit of balance to keep companies in check is something that I applaud the EU for.; This feels like ChatGPT delivering a techbro pitch on anarcho-capitalism, similar to those guys who say anything to get a girl into bed and then disappear.

No? It's exactly the opposite. Precisely because there is a threat of tariffs on North American products, which would become more expensive in the EU, these companies obviously don't want to be constantly paying fines to the EU, on top of the tariffs they already will have to pay, right?

And precisely because there are tense relations between the EU and America, it is most likely that there will be a harsh response to non-compliance with standards as a kind of retaliation of hatred on the part of the Europeans.

Businesses know they will be caught in the crossfire, and they know that Trump obviously can't solve these problems, if anything he's will only making them worse with the things he says about the EU.

And what the hell are they going to do? Leave the European market? The 2nd largest economy in the world with 400 million high-income consumers?

This is nothing new, I don't understand what the title has to do with this

If anything, American protectionism would also benefit hegemonic American sectors in Europe as it would give European growth space to sectors that would normally be at a disadvantage, but would not, because of retaliatory tariffs and sanctions.

>it's time to heavily long US Tech Stocks imo 

Trump's policies are policies that will strongly favor companies at the expense of Americans, so I would say yes, it is time to invest in America as stocks will explode for a few years.; Over the top regulations?; No they will not, there is just some rules you need to follow if you want to be in EU and most of those rules are good and protect the users, maybe you instead should hope USA improve on that, so USA is not made for companies first and civilians last.; Do you have any examples of what regulations being pushed back on would provide a tailwind? You make a lot of claims but calling out specific examples would be a good way to support your hypothesis. 

Half of EUs lawsuits against big tech are anti-trust which protects EU companies and consumers. And it’s pretty telling that instead of stopping service in those areas, they pay the fine, make some changes, and move on.; If EU retaliates in kind to Tariffs you may see even more active measures from them on US tech (same from China, would it only be because they are still critical in some supply chains like Apple's).

That may shrink US tech target adressable markets, or increase their cost base in some of their non domestic markets (to comply with regulations). Open borders and low frictions to scale beyond the US is also what allowed these companies to establish a market share beyond the US and dominate the local, non US competition. 

They do provide superior products overall but do not forget that if they are kneecaped that could reshuffle the cards somewhat. I am not saying this will happen but this is a scenario that you shouldn't discount that easily.; Less regulations is always good 100% of the time. Enable the parasite to help the host. Ignore Upton Sinclair. There is no nuance here.; EU on this i think is better, and you can't innovate at the cost of privacy I think.
Anyhow it's wrong to believe that EU won't ""fight"" the tariffs Trump is saying, consider that EU looses business with most countries because of US embargoes, that in a new context would be opened ( I don't think and i hope EU doesn't do that kind of things anyway). So by isolating a country from commerce it would be a loose loose. I hope they come to terms and say we net our commerce, and that would increase economy both sides.
Tech included; Or, if Trump goes overboard with his trade war, the EU can just ban the EU tech companies, finally allowing domestic ones to emerge. It's not like a search engine and a social network are hard to do in 2024.; 30% is nothing with easier regulations; Me too. ; Agreed. We know the US will always bow down so at least some regulatory body is trying to do something; It’s pretty telling when these companies pay the fine, make a few changes, and then move on. 

But weirdly some people will tell you that every tech service is a convo away from pulling out of the EU lol.; Yeah - us from the EU are actually happy that at least one region is taking steps to regulate their behavior.; Agree.; without the EU, we wouldn't even have GDPR. literally every protection we have on the internet, is SOLELY because it was cheaper for tech companies to just add those features for all users

I applaud them! I work in security btw, which is always a useless pain in the ass, and yes can be overly restrictive....but there will come a day when you need it, and you'll be glad it's there

EU regulations are the same way; But hurting jobs and retirement savings is even worse. ; The balance in question being 

No ecosystem integration for tech companies like Apple

Cannot push AI productivity because they are afraid of layoffs and cannot paid unemployed to everyone

Social system in decline so they push the privacy narrative while also wanted to break encryption for ""our own good""  
  
how human is that; Flair as Industry Discussion, you know what discussion means ?; EU is too weak, they are at the verge of civil war, with tech jobs also going dry over there it's a matter of time for them to relax a lot of their demands; Which don't make sense for most of what I saw in the tech sector, innovation must accelerate; See my other comment on EU regulations  that sabotage their productivity because they are not ready to accelerate; Yes in particular the AI Act,

It's a huge sector with massive implication on the health, legal and many desk jobs sector 

EU is against that kind of innovation since they are not ready to have thousands of layoffs they would rather put humans to write with pen and paper, it's happening now and only the heavy regulations block a lot of companies from increased productivity; Most governments run on Microsoft tech. That alone makes this an unlikely scenario.; Yeah with major countries in Europe having $MSFT (Azure) as health hub, let me laugh; 30% is insane. Besides, those tariffs, combined with his other policies could actually cause a recession, so there's a good chance that the gains under Trump will be nowhere near that number - or even negative.; Doesn't China count? /S; Most European countries don't have stock-based retirement systems, at least not something along the lines of a 401k.; Welp... someone doesn't really understand the EU privacy laws huh?

I'm not arguing they aren't bad for business to some extent, but not in the way you're claiming. They also protect the consumer from targeted psychological marketing and data farming. 

Data is the new currency. When companies take it from you they are taking money out of your pocket. Thats where the extra revenue comes from. If data collection were more restricted, companies would be forced to actually pay us for the value we provide to them and wouldn't be able to build such frighteningly accurate consumer models of individuals. 

Did you know that, as an American, it is nearly certain there are at least a handful of companies out there that know almost every aspect of your life and psychological profile and actively use that to sell things to you? Even if they can't, they sell that personal info to others who think they can. 

So the argument comes down to individual autonomy, privacy, and freedom vs corporate profits.

I don't like overarching regulation, but people have proven that greed will never police itself.; Civil war? Really? Take it down a notch.; >EU is too weak, they are at the verge of civil war

Is the Trump and Russia propaganda so ingrained in your ass that you say shit like this with such certainty? You mental?

>with tech jobs also going dry over there

This man is crazy

My friend, I live in the EU, and I assure you, from the bottom of my heart, that we are not in a civil war, that the EU is not at all weak in economic matters and that we have, believe it or not, a lot of work in the technology sector. 

The EU usually becomes more united when there is a common enemy, Trump only serves as ammunition for a more united Europe. Do you realize that?

^(this fucker is from my country, Portugal, and is saying stupid shit like this wtf?); I'm in Europe, and you've been looking at too much Fox propaganda if you think ""they are at the verge of civil war"". Most politicians here would get a boost to their popularity if they banned some US tech companies.

Yes, Europe regulates heavily, but it's what the population wants. And yes we also recognise that this needs to be balanced with economic growth.; Lol, you are living in an alternate reality if you think EU is on the verge of civil war.

In another comment you say you are from EU but I seriously doubt that.

First, if countries in the EU went to war with each other it wouldn't be a civil war. It would just be a war. I think you read too many dumb Musk tweets there.

Second, Trump presidecy likely means EU will be more united than before.

Third, if you want innovation within EU as you said in another comment then protectionism is good for EU.; There was an insurrection and attempt to overturn the election which a 3rd of the US population keeps downplaying/denying or is just ok with. 
There's a fascist playbook ready for the incoming administration to apply.
Basicly all former staff, including decorated generals, warned that you're putting a wannabe dictator back in charge.
....

I'm thinking the US is much closer to resigning their global dominance and a civil war.; But wasn't it about consumer data and protection. I remember also EU taxing apple for the ireland headquarters thing; Oh they don't need to ban them completely. They can just ban google search, or facebook. Sure, the USA can retaliate and ban them completely but the idea is the EU is not completely toothless.; Yeah, I now think the chances of us seeing a 2018-esque replay for 2026 are being underrated.


I wouldn't have a different mindset the other way as well and frankly this would probably be the better option over what I think is also possible. I think option B is that we get as close to the 2020-2021 environment as you can without ZIRP, then Trump holds the bag of the first secular bear market since the early 00's later in his term.; I'm in tech sector in the EU, I won't dox myself but I see the numbers and it's bad  
I don't need to watch Fox and any propaganda to see that

I too enjoy the social aspect of EU but here it's all about innovation, which we LACK; See my comment above; >In another comment you say you are from EU but I seriously doubt that.

He is, he's from fucking Portugal of all places

I'm also from Portugal. But I live in the peaceful part of the country. Understand that while I woke up today and went to university worried about my exams, he woke up, grabbed his SCAR and went to fight the communists worried about their victory in the European civil war.; See my comment history, then apologize then think for 30 seconds about the recent events in EU, united in poverty maybe; it wont be a civil war..  trump will control the US military.  it will be an ethnic cleansing.; Ireland did not comply with European taxation law. So the EU forced these companies to pay the Irish government years of unpaid taxes.; I think option B, personally. Time will tell; I think you are mistaking fairly local issues in one specific industry with the entirety of the EU. I get it, it is easy to get sucked into your own industry and what you work with, but you must realize that, even though your industry may be important, it is not everything. Your comment about some supposed civil war is absurd, and to be frank, quite childish. 

Innovation within the EU with regards to tech (specifically digital technology), is one that the EU is lacking in, sure. But do not mistakenly believe that such is the case in every other industry, I assure you, it is not. The US is strong in digital tech innovation, but is not as strong with regards to other industries, that the EU is stronger in. It's the way of the world, and if you've ever read Global trade 101, you know that it is exactly this imbalance that creates the demand for international export/import. 

But sure, the EU could do a bit better in this, very specific field.; I agree that Europe massively lacks behind the US in terms of innovation, but what does that have to do with a civil war? The US is arguably much closer to a civil war with how divided the country is. But even there, claiming that a civil war is imminent would be ridiculous.

Also, i really don't think that the problem with the EU are regulations around stuff like misinformation or AI. The biggest problem is a general aversion to risk and a lack of venture capital, combined with pretty big regulatory hurdles to start a business - but those things apply to all sectors, not just tech.; Stay safe out there, brother.; Thinking that you aren't from EU was giving you the benefit of the doubt for your ignorance.

Tech innovation in EU is weak, yes but you don't strenghten it by giving foreign tech giants more leeway.

My advice is read less musk tweets and get a grip on reality.; [deleted]; So you just assume the military leadership will not be loyal to their country and the constitution but to trump?; Specific field ? Industry lost to china, Tech to US  
What is left? the social aspect, holidays ? 

Germany using coal and (inexistent) wind instead of Nuclear ? 

You can read companies closing at a faster rate in almost every industry in Europe, the golden age is clearly over; I like your take on it, the sentence general aversion to risk is spot on; let's see in a year if anything changed

Spoilers, no; by ethnic i meant anti-trumpers.; We are currently in a more tumultuous time period. Those come and go every few decades. If you zoom out and look at history, this period is not that remarkable compared to previous problematic times. Yet, with the current traditional and social media situation, people seem to be thinking the doomsday is near. Look around and you'll see people with exactly the same sentiment, but about another issue in the US, Japan, Korea, Australia, various European countries, and so on.

We've been through many problems before, and we'll get through them again. 

With regards to Chinese manufacturing: This alarmist shouting of yours (and many others) is exactly what happened a 50 years ago, when the Japanese manufacturing sector outshone that of their western counterparts. Yet, somehow, situations were resolved and the different nations have specialized in different fields of industry and segments of markets. China is currently undergoing such a time period, India will, soon as well. It will be disruptive, it will cause headaches, there will be uncertainties. 

I'm not saying we should ignore the issue completely. I am just saying that you are not doing yourself any favors by seemingly being this alarmed and upset about it.; I am not saying EU will become a tech innovation giant and EU does need to do a lot of work in that sector. Certainly there will be no ""civil war"", lol.

That said, you are dodging all the actual questions in this thread.

* How does it help the EU and their tech sector to give foreign tech companies more leeway and gain even more dominance on the EU market?

* Which regulations specifically do you think should/would be lifted that would boost the stock by a significant amount?

* Tarrifs will make everything more expensive, resulting in people buying less.

Also in general, going long on US tech has been very good since decades. That is not a revelation.; How about the lack of the freedom? 
This is concerning and wasn’t the case in earlier EU history. To innovate, create, manufacture anything it is an administrative pain, so much so that people prefer to leave

This aspect is not going away, the EU does everything it can to axe entrepreneurship for the masses"
Just saw a post about Motley Fool,"I signed up for their investment services in 2021. These were the stocks recommended by the service. I bought when I had an extra $1,000 to play with so I did not buy all of their picks every month.

I will say that they recommended picks like AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, AMZN, etc as well... but like duh. 

Anyways, I'll just leave this here.

[https://imgur.com/a/3uYNLCf](https://imgur.com/a/3uYNLCf)",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gnrwn1/just_saw_a_post_about_motley_fool/,361,"I had like 3 buddies who all split a MF subscription in 2019. They mostly bought any of the “big buy” (forgot the name of their recommendation scale) recommendations except for one guy who “does his own research” and only bought when he felt the business was stable. ALL of them lost money. The “cautious” guy lost the most 😅; Those results are hilariously bad; MF is like a paid subscription to Cramer. You’re going to lose.; [deleted]; Good ole LMND. They fucked me on that one.; If you put that amount into SPY in July 2021 you would have $19,541.46 right now, or a 39% increase (over 10% annualized).; You joined a high beta growth recommendation service right at a huge peak in a bubbly market that then crashed high flyers as bad or worse than in the GFC.  Timing matters. For instance, if you bought SHOP when they recommended it in 2014 (or 2016?), you'd be up 2,500%, even after the post-pandemic tech crash. But if you bought it in mid/late 2021, you'd still be down 50%.  You joined during a period of peak irrational exuberance.

That said, I think Fool has gotten worse than a dart throw, for the most part.  I made a gazillion on SHOP over the last 10 years, and if I had bought more NVDA when they pushed it, I'd have another gazillion (I'm up 1000%, but on an initially small position).  I'm also up a gazillion on NFLX from them.  But in the last few years, they've killed me on stocks that I really should've been more wary of, like Match Group, LMND, FVRR, PINS, and more.  Which is why I took such a wimpy little position in NVDA, unfortunately - I don't really trust them any more.; >2021 

lol; The general opinion among members is that it went downhill after one of the founders retired. They’ve had some great picks from 2000-2020 like Amazon, Netflix, and Nvidia when those companies were well-known but not the monsters they are today. One or two picks like that will make up for a lot of misses.; Damn…that’s not what I expected…sorry…; The problem for their service is they tell you what to buy , but they don’t tell you when to sell. So you eventually could lose all your gains; LEMONADE!!!!! Man, those were the days....; They put the”fool” in investing. Those guys are shills.; David Gardner was great. Tom was good, too. Bill Mann was good. Unfortunately David retired some years ago and I don’t think the others work on recommendations anymore either. MF lost its magic some time ago I’m sad to say. I loved it for learning when they started, and I feel they’ve lost their way on education and instead the marketers took over.; I used to have a subscription with them and I liked reading their recommendations for ideas. I had bought TTD back in 2019/2020 I think and have done well since then. I did also buy Shopify back in 2015/2016 or so and did well with it as well. 

However, I don't have the subscription anymore. Problem with a service like this is they have to keep churning out recommendations in order to feel worth it for subscribers. If they made posts saying ""I've got no recommendations right now"" then they wouldn't get any subscribers. So I felt like they just make suggestions regardless of the price of a stock. 

Also, their recommendations were not as detailed as I'd like. Very high level with little analysis provided. 

I did like their Motley Fool Money podcast and did listen to it religiously. But have slowed down/stopped recently because the host Chris Hill left and the replacement hosts are just no where near as good. 

I'm glad I used to use it, because I felt like I learned a bit from them. But not anymore.; are they just copying the baddest of bad cathy wood picks?; They had a portfolio service called Supernova that I subscribed to for a while and did amazing. It also included a feature I loved where they published the slack conversations of the analysts who were picking for the service so you could see their rational for their picks and how they would make arguments for them to each other. 

Everything else of theirs has been shit.; All of these services and gurus don't know shit or have every motivation to give you suspect advice. Why? For their own personal gain. 

By the time you get their advice you're likely late to the party anyway.; If they really knew what they were doing, why don't they launch their own Motley Fool mutual fund or ETF that beats the market every year??; I stopped reading Motley Fool when I noticed Neil Patel, the know plagiarizer was writing for them. I immediately blocked any of their articles showing up in my feed 

I’ve made money from their tips in the past but it’s gone downhill for a good 3-5 years now; I bought VLD because of an article on this shit stain of a website. The company got delisted and I’m down -92% all of this in less than a year.; The big risk with MF etc isn't that you'll go there once, pick stocks based on what you see, hold them for years, and have those stocks underperform.

They would go broke if people used the site that way.

They want to keep you off-balance, feeling like you always need to be checking them. And if you're doing that, you're probably constantly buying and selling based on shifting notions, which is the surest way to fail in investing.

They won't tell you this is what they're doing, they'll write articles like ""10 energy stocks to buy and hold forever"". And then next week they'll tell you 10 tech stocks to buy and hold forever, etc. 

They don't care if you end up 10k or 100k poorer at retirement because of them. If they make their 10 bucks in ad revenue from you over the years, they're good.; They don't call it fool for nothing..; I tried it. Paid for a month, and when they spent the entire time trying to still get money from me, I figured it wasn’t worth it.; Lemonade is a good call now!; The thing that made me quit MF was when they recommended Go Pro [(GPRO)](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/gpro?mod=search_symbol) as a buy at $80. That is, I canceled after I got done laughing. Their rationale was even funnier than the rec itself. 

It's $1.46 today.;  I’ve never thought that paying for investment advice, but my old boss killed it on their picks. He had over $1M of Tesla at one point on a $60,000 investment.  He also crushed it on Shopify, and a couple others.  In 2020 he owned 4 of 5 best performing stocks of the year, all MF picks. 

Somewhat convinced, I asked for the latest big pick and put $40,000 into Teledoc that’s now worth about $3,000.; If you are not a savvy investor, I think you should start with an index (eg SP500) and a few blue chips (eg mag 7), to familiarize yourself with the market while keeping your risk manageable. For an index like SP500 and companies like mag 7, they do go up and down, but in the longer term (say 3y to 5y) you are still quite likely to make money rather than lose money.; MF is literally regarded; There is a reason its called Motley **FOOL**; I always laugh a bit whenever I see their advertisements saying X% returns over the sp500. Like if you were making so much money from an investments you wouldn't be trying to sell me your knowledge, yous just be investing in it yourself and collecting the payday.

Also some of those companies are crazy. Roku peaked around $450 in 2021. They make a decent enough product (been using a Roku ultra for many years now and a Roku 3 on another TV for even longer), but it seems like a very copyable device.; Reminds me decades ago when I learning about investing when there was little knowledge and information for everyone, internet was uncommon, I discovered toxic or scam information is still something to gain knowledge by figuring out the things behind, because back then that's the only sources you can get, no one on TV or news paper is educated and financial literacy; Are there any other alternative to MF?; After I took a beating on Under Armour after they pumped it to death, I realized they didn't know what they were talking about.; We’re the stocks you bought even recommended by MF? Those look more like Reddit recommendations to me.; Unfortunately you just barely missed their NVDA recommendation; Articles like this prove Motley Fool is a joke of a website:

https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/09/38-percent-of-warren-buffetts-315-billion-is-in-3/; As a fellow naive investor, I offer sympathy. I used to read MF's free articles with interest, but eventually something about it started to feel off. I realized that ""investing"" really means index funds. Buying single stocks is ""gambling"". If I want to gamble, an evening at the blackjack table is cheaper, more predictable, and much more fun.; They have a knack for picking things right before they dump.  Look more at it being a short sellers report was my lesson.; I’m not MF, but get in QS asap, it’s going to explode next year.; Thank you for your sacrifice.; Thats a lot of profit pal. The irony is in their name.; I've always figured that anyone capable of actually beating the indexes, would be too busy making giant stacks of money from the market (or running a private hedge fund) to have the time to market and produce advice newsletters, websites, etc.; [removed]; Signed up for autopilot and bought most of these. No charge.; And here I am up 24% this year just by continuing to buy more of the random assortment of shares I had accrued from “freebies”.; I bought around the same time you did. Had money to invest from selling a house. Lost 100k+; Haha, I'm with you. Bought a lot of that shit too.; The timing of their recommendations is usually off. They recommend at high stock prices.  I've learned to just watch their recommendations and buy the dip.; A callback to peak euphoria.; good old boring index funds is the way!; The first rule of thumb about investing is, get over whatever fascination with Mötley fool you have as quickly as possible; Got a free one year subscription with them through CC promotion. I bought a few of their picks but ended up losing money. I did not renew when I keep seeing their articles about ""Why stock XYZ is up 50% today"", ""why stock is down 20% today."" on Yahoo Finance. 

One way for them to get you hooked into subscribing is how they keep announcing a new pick every two weeks or so. However, there are so many stocks out there, if you buy all their picks then might as well buy total market index or SP500.; Yeah, i gave up on Motley Fool.   I have toyed with Investor's Business Daily before.  I may resubscribe to them, but curious if anyone here subscribes to IBD currently and their experience?  I know it's more growth oriented while MF is more value focused.; I've never taken their articles serious.  No real data, they come off as native ads, kind of like forbes articles. Just a paid puff piece for a company.  Always terrivle advice or just obvious front running hot stocks. Never considered signing up for their service.

I always go to seeking alpha if I see a stock name pop up enough in the area I'm looking at.  I like sites with a comment section so I can see if people are destroying the author. 😂; Skillz, Pinterest and Lemonade....I bought that crap too, on the recommendation of MF

I cancelled my subscription (not in time to get a refund) and told the customer service person that if I ever subscribed again, it would be in an effort to use their recommendations as a contra-indicator.

MF is beyond awful.; Oof; Shit. there’s fool in their name for a reason. I don’t like the motley fool.; I lost money on FVRR and ROKU lol; I have their lowest tier subscription for years. Largely just do it for companies to research. I’ve lost on a couple during Covid, but man, they got me in to nvidia so I’m happy lol; It's ok i have 10 articles i like better!; Motley Fool also recommend SMCI even after it got confirmed they are manipulating their accounting book.   
It goes without saying, they are pretty bad.; It seems like it would be hard to get to that level of bad with trying, almost impossible by random picks from SPY top-end.; You're not alone! I didn't renew!; Love how they try to tell you the returns you will see. Always do your own research!; I would avoid any service that does not meticulously track **all** their picks, along with recommended buy/sell dates, and present that history to subscribers. Show your work, or all the marketing in the world is worthless.; So I had $30,000 to invest and a Motley Fool buy list showed up on my Yahoo page.  They had five stocks. Two did not do well, I got rid of them quick, one is up a bit, one is up 28% and one is up 50%.  Not bad.  With those and my picks I am up $2600 in the last three weeks.; Your suppose to push Webistics!; Please try Unrivaled Investing next and let us know if it's good; Thanks for sharing. A few times I’ve thought about subscribing but I didn’t like that all their examples were from 15+ years ago.; I tried them a few years ago and lost money. Some picks were good but mostly they were a pump and dump factory.; IDK how anyone hears of an organization called ""Motley Fool"" and thinks...""yeah, that's who I want deciding my financial future.""; MF is another pump and dump!; I read MF as Mother Fuckers as they should've been called.; A lot of bashing the Fools, but I've made money with their newslestter.  Lost money on the Roku tho.; Thats strange when the motley fool 100 is up 512% to the s&p 85% over the last 5. ?; Just imagine losing money in the stock market since 2019. Yes, it was volatile, but the market had outstanding returns in total.; It’s just like buying into a Kramer pick.  

Dumb.  Don’t do it.

These guys just use marketing and their own influence so you pump and they can dump.; Isn't that the key that you just buy exactly what they propose and in equal amounts and when they say.  Most of their picks will fail but some are supposed to pop, which will cover your losses easily.; OP is indeed a motley fool; Or inverse, and you win; I swear they are starting to astroturf on Reddit; Which Cramer or Kramer; [deleted]; 100% in his scenario; 19/3; Yep.. gave me lemons; If you include reinvested dividends its 45.7% return in SPY

https://totalrealreturns.com/n/SPY?start=2021-07-01; This is gonna sound like a “kids these days” comment but modern MF is very different and very diluted compared to what early MF was like.  Early MF portfolios did have some meteoric picks that drove big gains - which is along the lines of a Peter Lynch-style approach hunting “ten-baggers” and such.  As the MF guys expanded their services and monetized more, and as the Lynch style of investing has subsided in popularity, the whole MF experience isn’t like how it was back in the day.; The founders left the company around 4 years ago. I can’t find an article on it. Leadership matters. I started investing in ‘06 and have done well with MF. But I don’t just but every rec they make.; Yep, this is the right answer. I bought OKTA at their recommendation and made a lot of money. They also recommended NFLX back when it was $19 and many others at good times to buy. I wouldn’t buy everything they pitch, but worth looking at to see if anything passes your own scrutiny.; My biggest problem with them is that they do not refer to timing at all in their recs. I understand the idea of picking the best companies and holding them forever, however, WHEN to buy a stock is also very important. And they just don't cover that at all. To buy before earnings, wait a Q or few, nothing. They have some good analysis once you buy in, but all very general in terms of timeline.

I resigned and went for a totally different service, with live tracking of the investments, and addressing the importance of when to buy stock.; David of the Gardner bros retired a few years back and he was always the better performing brother. They have a pretty large team overall but most services underperformed the base service, of which David’s picks had half the weight. So, yeah… now it’s a bunch of monkeys throwing darts.; My motto is I'll never buy stocks that aren't 'sexy'. Nvidia - very sexy. Netflix too.; Overall, I have done well with them as long as I added another layer of due diligence and researched the fundamentals via other sources AND didn’t held on to the stock until MF’s sell signal. I made really good money on several of their recommendations.; A paid stock picking service during peak euphoria. These results are exactly what I expected to see.; On the plus side, they did turn me on to UPST, which I got more of at close to all time lows (around $16.60)... so silver lining there; Thanks for that. I was thinking of joining with emails I get bombarded with offers from them - now I will not.; Those that can't will teach. lol; TMFC; >If you are not a savvy investor, I think you should start with an index (eg SP500) ~~and a few blue chips (eg mag 7), to familiarize yourself with the market while keeping your risk manageable. For an index like SP500 and companies like mag 7, they do go up and down, but in the longer term (say 3y to 5y) you are still quite likely to make money rather than lose money.~~; Well they simply lie.

Not long after gme I saw them promoting ""the next big think wallstreetbets is talking about"".

So seeing wallstreetbets is public, I go and check. No one is talking about the stock mentioned. At all.

So if they are happy to lie about something so simple to check, what does it say about the rest of their picks?; Seeking Alpha is pretty good; Learning to do your own research or just sticking to index funds; Hi Redditor, it would seem you have strayed too far from WSB, there are emojis detected.

I had the newsletter many years ago..it was one of those BUY THIS STOCK NOW!
I ate at a Chipotle and didn't see what the big deal was...I still don't.; This is impossible. They put out 2 articles.

Whatever is right makes their list and they will highlight it for the next 10 years to advertise their subscription.; It depends indeed; r/theydidthemath; This is true.

Thoughts on Globalstar (GSAT) post-election,"GSAT is my speculative play right now. Looks like it is (maybe was) a good runner, with apple using it for their satellite cell service, and non-emergency use/satellite text coming in 2025.

Problem: SpaceX/Starlink and GSAT are in a battle over satellite radio bands. FCC dismissed SpaceX's request to basically take over GSAT's dedicated section of bandwidth.

But Musk is now firmly latched onto future POTUS, in what is certain to become a grifty political-economic symbiosis.

After reading that, it feels like Dish and EchoStar might be more seriously in the crosshairs, considering they are the only entity authorized in the 2GHz band. 

I think with $AAPL backing and signaling they will find $GSAT as long as goals are met, SpaceX (and possibly even $TSLA) would benefit from taking ownership of EchoStar, their IP, and band.

But I acknowledge I have a position in $GSAT and want them to succeed. And I never did like Dish ;); No but those 2027 January $3 calls for .60 not looking so bad.

Opinion of IG vs ETF for long-term investing? Numerical examples wanted!,"I'll try to keep this short.

I (31M) am in Canada and have a steady job with a pension, own my house, no large debts (besides mortgage and car), and have 47K in cash that I've been sitting on for far too long. I have played with stocks in the past on Questrade and have basically only come out slightly positive because of investments in Apple and AMD. I was suggested a financial advisor and started talking with one at IG Wealth Management.

Long story short: I'm getting cold feet at pulling the trigger with them. The portfolio they are suggesting is the iProfile Portfolio Global Equity Series F managed by Philip Petursson. Based on my aggressive investing stance, I'd be paying a 2.37% fee (MER of 1.01%). However this portfolio has nice returns after accounting for the fee (8.11 for 3YR, 28.01 for 1YR, 18.38 YTD).

But doing some quick maths it looks like the fees would cost me $300K over 25 years in fees (if I'm investing 10-12k a year). This does not account for a waived or decreased fee once you hit $250k, which would be around year 11 for me.

When I asked about these numbers they said that These funds are actively managed and you're paying for the available advice, as well as dampening losses in bad years, and overall a better return in the long run compared to index funds. They also said an expected growth per year is 7%.

I was also cautioned that ETFs have hidden fees that are not shown upfront...which from what I have read, is not true.

I know these advisors are salesmen that want to gain more clients. But I'm also aware that anyone can post their financial advice on reddit and act like it is the gospel while having no credentials to back it up.

So my question is: What are people's experiences with IG vs ETFs and self investing? Would people be willing to share their experiences with either ETFs or IG and give numerical examples to back up their stance?

Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gmtoc6/opinion_of_ig_vs_etf_for_longterm_investing/,6,"Paying a 2.37% fee is like financial suicide. 


Absolutely not. 


IG is not a serious shop, either.


Also: ""and overall a better return in the long run compared to index funds."" 
Total horseshit. 


This fund has to beat the market by 2.37% every year for the next 34 years plus up to 30 years after that to your age 95.


And that is to just march the market returns you could get for 0.03% fees.


Don't be stupid.; I agree 2.37% is a lot, and is what made me pump the brakes with them. Truth is 300K ridiculous for advice, unless it's going to make me millions. But as a beginner to long term investing, I wanted to make sure that I wasn't underestimating the use of an Advisor.

So, even ignoring fees, would an ETF like VEQT or XEQT be equal or better to the returns of IGI1902 portfolio?; If you want ""market"" returns, go for vxc which is world excluding Canada. 


VEQT or xeqt would be the one-fund solution I would take.


Mer is 0.22% for those. Paying 2.1% more is just not a good idea."

I’ve owned AXON since 2021, todays rise was more than my cost basis 😤; So I'm a cop, and heavy Axon investor, but this technology is being really over-valued.  Courts really haven't accepted AI generated reports yet, which mean Axon's Draft1 across the board can only be used for reports that can't possibly generate an arrest, meaning the reports that should already be done online.  The AI also can't differentiate between two people talking, so any time you have more than the most basic of basic of reports, it's useless.  Any report Draft1 can write, I can write faster.  

There have been multiple other programs that have demonstrated better AI use in report writing, but until the courts catch up with them, they're essentially useless.  People thought body cameras would negate report writing, but it actually just made it so much worse.  AI's integration to the criminal justice system has yet to be seen.

I’ve missed out on many gains by being to timid due to valuations across the market.; Keep sitting on the sidelines pal; I expect a pullback next ER; Sure does. Took my $$ out of Axon at age 24 when I became a addict; Today’s rise was 7x my basis lol.; Any thoughts on the drone? Any departments out there looking to integrate them into vehicles yet?; Still absolutely dominating and isolating the BWV and storage marker though. Shit, uniformed are axon mounts specific and we are 100% dependant on axon servers. 

They will keep going up untill there's a serious data breach and that's that.; Absolutely.  Tasers just use carriages to shoot so you don’t need a new one every time they’re used, and most departments will get the newest tasers for “free” as part of their safety plan/subscription to the eco system.  

They keep releasing more and more law enforcement based products which will become necessary for departments to adopt, and there’s competitors but they’re not on the same level.  They’re also getting into the private sector and basically exponentially increasing their total addressable market by looking beyond law enforcement.  We’ll see if that takes off, I believe it will.; Currently I think it's a good play even if there is almost no actual growth. The global police and security areas are hooked on axon servers like it's meth. EU is solely dependant on axon, there is no local storage anymore. 

Body worn videos, suspect interviews, victim interviews, CCTV and phone videos are ALL recorded on axon devices, stored on axon servers and sent to court using axon share.; Our department has their tasers and body cameras but that’s it.  However, pretty much every department will slowly start adopting more and more of their services because they’re simply the best and integrate well together.  Saying they’re the Apple ecosystem of law enforcement is accurate.  Once you have an iPhone, it makes sense to get other Apple products.  Axon is the same way.  Total position is around half a mil after today.; The company today is different from the company when I was buying in the $20s.  I basically bought them in the 20s with the hope they’d become the company they are today.  I’m buying today with the hope they’ll become the company I think they will in another 10ish years.  Seeing the average share price go up hurts a little, but I still believe in the company moving forward so I’ll continue to buy.  Have to switch my mindset a little so it doesn’t hurt as much haha; Same here. People in this sub were talking about it after George Floyd. It was *only* around $80 back then. I'm kicking myself too; It will be a week or two before I model it, but fair play to you for getting in early enough, you took the risk and earned the reward. With the new administration, do you think they’re going to get a lot of favouritism and bumper contracts?; How so?; I can hope and pray; Their drones are way more expensive than their competitors (DJI has that market covered, but they’re China based so have security concerns) and don’t offer too much of an increase in production and connectivity.  Their drone offerings seem to exist just so they can say they have them.  However, reading the founder/CEOs book, drones are a huge part of his vision for the future, but even talking about arming drones with even Tasers resulted in basically the whole ethics board of the company resigning.  

Axon has the best in car cameras and their vision of the future of having drones follow around vehicles and respond to calls first is amazing, and with “live crime” centers becoming a thing across the country, I think Axon will be a major player in that market.  They kinda need to get out of their own way in that regard though.  To compare it to Tesla, they’re selling the model S but everyone wants/needs the model 3, and they don’t really offer that in drone tech quite yet.; Thank you, I did not realize they use subscription based model that's incredibly powerful, I wonder if they're working with out countries yet and their police agencies which seems could be next step reaching global market?; It definitely won’t hurt them, that’s all I have to say on that topic. I also wouldn’t call it a huge victory, I had to sell my shares under $200 and missed an even lower cost basis. $400 with only a 4K position isn’t great. Hoping to build up to $10,000 though, just not sure if I should wait for a pullback. Holding for 20 years though so probably doesn’t matter"
"$285k to invest, new to this! ","Hi all, 

I have a Vanguard brokerage account that I invested in 10 years ago based on advice I received. I did okay with it. I was honestly not educated in investing in this way at all and it was too risky for me - so I didn’t look further into it besides putting some money in the stocks below and never looking at it. Stocks I’m in are VUG, QQQ, SPY, VXF, AAPL. 

I recently found out about this group and I’m ready to rework my personal investments. 

I have $160k in Vanguard brokerage. $125k in an HYSA at 5.05%. I also have a rental condo that I plan to sell next year and may just add the earnings to the brokerage account too. $500k condo (200k equity, 120k mortgage left, rest is profit). 

I’m able to freely invest that money and am thinking something along the lines of keep $15k in HYSA. (I have another $20k in personal savings that doesn’t really get touched.) Put $270k in VTI/VXUS (80/20) and just let it sit until my husband retires. (15 or so years)

My questions are based on not knowing how to work the platform, sell my current shares, are fees involved?, how to avoid any costly mistakes when selling and reinvesting, making sure dividends are reinvested, etc…

1.) Can I use the brokerage account that I currently have for VTI/VXUS, VOO, etc.?

2.) Can I sell my current positions and buy new ones tax/free? 

3.) Is there a new predicted dip to wait for since the market is up quite a bit due to the election? Is it worth waiting for anything to go down or is it best to get money into VTI/VXUS right now due to the long term strategy? 

4.) Can someone kindly give me a step by step on how to sell my current positions and then reinvest? Basically a dummy proof version that can tell me? Otherwise kindly advise me where to go to find this info. 

5.) I’m open to any constructive criticisms/advice here, so feel free.

Thank you for your advice and help - I very much appreciate it! 



",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gmlkbj/285k_to_invest_new_to_this/,1,"1) Yes, you can buy VTI and VXUS at Vanguard
 
2) You can sell but will be taxed for any gains in a non-tax advantaged account.  If this is in a 401k or Roth IRA there is no tax implications from selling as long as the money stays in the account.
 
3) Just lump sum invest, it generally beats trying to dollar cost average.  You can’t time the market.
 
4) Select your holding and click the sell button :)
 
5) You mentioned being about 15 years from retirement, I’d recommend mixing in some bonds as well.  You can mirror a target date fund composition.
 
6) Keep 3 - 6 months of expenses in a HYSA or MMKT.  That total will be different for everyone.; Use the search bar. Whether you have $1,000 or $100,000, the advice you get here is going to be the same; Assuming this is invested in a taxable brokerage account (eg not an IRA or 401k), you will be taxed on the gains. Do you know how much the gains are and the fraction which are short / long term?

I get the desire for simplicity but I would not spend a ton of money to achieve that. It’s not that bad of a scenario if you basically maintain these assets. You can use your future investments to have your portfolio with these mirror the VTI/VXUS portfolio you want. It requires a bit of spreadsheeting but it shouldn’t be complicated.

QQQ and to a lesser extent SPY have high expense ratios though. They’re more intended for providing liquidity for trading and for the options chains rather than as a long term investment. There is math to be done to figure out if you should sell them for cheaper ETFs. We can help you figure that out!

Going forward with future investments the questions you should ask are what is the expense ratio and am I creating the distributions of investments that I want to.; I'm a simpleton investor but I'll give it a shot:

1. Yes, you should be able to buy VOO etc.. etfs just like buying a stock.

2. You will have to pay taxes once you sell and realize your profits. (This can be complicated by your type of brokerage/investment types).

3. No one can predict the future, but you sure can read thousands of opinions on it. Buy for long term and hold through the ups and downs. ""Time in the market beats timing the market.""

4. I'll let someone else advise on that. I know nothing of real estate.

5. Good luck and happy growth!; MVIS ; Something tells me that the United States is facing a crisis because the stock market has been doing too well for a long time.; Do you have Nana? If Yes, Invest in Intel!; Study Bitcoin.; Thank you!

2.) Is there anyway around this where I can just defer them for later? If I do sell and pay the taxes, should I keep this brokerage account or opt for a tax advantaged one? First year as a stay at home mom. I don’t think there are any tax advantaged accounts for me now. Husband has a 401k and an IRA. I can potentially consider adding these funds to those if the benefits outweigh everything? But personally, rather not, as it’s my personal pre marriage emergency funds. 

3.) lump sum invest the rest vs. what some people suggest as adding $1000 a week/monthly? 

5.) I will look into bonds. I briefly searched. Are target date funds and bonds the same thing? 

Thanks for your time!; And then go all in on vti/vxus; 2nd studying Bitcoin; - You can open a Roth IRA and contribute $7k a year per person, that isn’t through an employer and it’s after tax contributions which grow tax free.
 
- If your husband has the option of a HSA at work that’s another good tax advantage option.  It reduces your reportable income and grows tax free.

- If you’re selling in a brokerage account you will be taxed.  Maybe someone smarter than me can give suggestions on tax harvesting though which may lighten the blow.
 
- It’s been proven lump summing generally works out better in the end.  People recommend investing it in pieces more from a mental perspective so if the market goes down you don’t see so much disappear at once.  In the long run, over a longer time period you’re most likely better off just doing it all at once.
 
- A target date fund is a mix of stocks and bonds with a composition that adjust as you get closer to your retirement age by adding more bonds based on your age.  It’s not recommended for a taxable account but is fine in a tax advantage account as long as the expense ratio is on the lower end.; You can both lump sum and DCA => put in 50% right away then average the rest in 12+ months (or whatever you are comfortable with, more time for less risk but less hypothetical return); Given the ETFs and APPL stock you are invested in, you’ve probably done well in the stock market.

2 - Assuming this is a taxable brokerage account, I would leave the funds invested as they are for the short term, while you do some more research.  I’d want to see how much you have in each of the funds and how much you have (for each) in unrealized capital gains (or losses).  You will be taxed on your capital gains.  It might make sense to focus on selling the APPL stock first, because you have exposure to it in some of the other ETFs.  You’ll need to look at your overall tax situation to determine when it might make sense to sell, ie. you might spread the sales over more than one tax year.

3 - I would lump sum the $100k of new money into the new funds you want to invest in.  At $1000/week, you risk missing out on potential gains.  If there is a dip, it should recover in a reasonable amount of time.  Just don’t sell, while it’s down.  

4 - Bonds aren’t TDFs.  

TDFs are funds that contain a mixture of stocks and bonds.  A 2025 TDF will have a larger percentage of bonds (most retirees want to preserve their nest egg, should the market drop at a time when they need the income to pay their bills) versus a 2065 TDF that will have little to no bonds in it (young people will have more time in the market and are presumably still adding to their holdings)."

Crazy how fast this stock has moved I'd expect a post euphoria pullback at some point.; [deleted]; Clown stock, clown market, clown world.; If this continues I will enter a short position; Reddit is proven once again to be completely out of touch with the market.

Enjoy your gains, kids!; I was told on reddit that Elon will run it into the ground.; Can someone please explain this to me? I get that Musk's other businesses (particularly SpaceX) are likely to feast on government contracts but am I wrong in thinking Tesla is in a sticky spot right now? The average Tesla buyer is a middle to upper-middle class person who believes in climate change... you know, a Democrat! For the last year I've seen Teslas in my city with bumper stickers saying ""I bought it before he went crazy!"". Musk has so unabashedly embraced MAGA... so crassly and emphatically raised a middle finger to the lefter side of the American political spectrum...I have to think 60-70% of his customer base will never buy another car from him at this point and very possibly you may see a flooding of the used market. I cant imagine Joe the Plumber is going to now go out and buy 'one of those little pansy EVs' now... What am I missing? Why is Tesla (specifically Tesla and not Musk's other businesses which I know are not public) surging.; I literally called this,  it didn’t actually think it would happen.. so annoying 😂

I will change subsidies to $20k for cars made by American manufacturers whose name starts with a T. Everyone else gets a zero.”

Took 6,000 points on the S&P 500. It was understood that it would try, but it was tried in just 4 days of growth on very high trading volumes - 1.5 times higher than usual. 

Usually high turnovers occur during quarterly expiration conditions (September and March this year) or during a major collapse (August 5-6, 2024), but even more rarely ... when a local high is forming. 

The last time there was comparable volume on an isthay breakout was in December 2021 when a high was formed, then the market fell about 25% for a year. 

The market rose 5.55% from Monday’s low to Friday’s high. The last time it happened was on 27.12.2021 (5.75%) at the moment of maximum formation. Another indicative breakout was 03.24.2000 (7.21%) and then the market formed the peak of the dotcom bubble, the high was updated only at the end of 2007 and consolidated 6 years later (more than 13 years of recovery attempts).

During the week 3 trillion of capitalization or +5.2% of market growth was created by 614 companies with 48.3 trillion of total capitalization. 

●The top 100 companies contributed 2.2 trillion in gains with a combined capitalization of 34.8 trillion.

●The top 50 companies contributed 1.87 trillion in incremental capitalization to the entire market with a total capitalization of 28.8 trillion. 

The top 5 companies contributed 837 bln: Nvidia - 317 bln, Tesla - 222 bln, Google - 101 bln, Microsoft - 100 bln, Amazon - 96.5 bln.

Over 1,000 companies (a quarter of all US public companies) showed a combined decline of 252bn, with a capitalization of 7.7 trillion, or about 12.5% of the entire market by capitalization. The leaders of the decline by scale were: Johnson & Johnson - 12.3 bln, Philip Morris and Pfizer - 10 bln, AbbVie - 8.6 bln.

The major contributors to the market growth pattern were:

- Technology: 1.37 trillion or +6.4%, contributing 46% of the total market growth or 2.4 p.p. to the overall growth of 5.2%

- Finance: 438bn or +6.2%, contributing 14.7% or 0.76pc.

- Business & Industry: 363 bln or +5.5%, contributing 0.63 p.p.

- Consumer Staples: 326 bln or +5.7%, contributing 0.56 p.p., but Tesla alone contributed 222 bln, and non-durable consumer goods were down 0.3% or minus 8 bln.

- Commerce: 234bn or +4.4% contribution was 0.41pc, where Amazon contributed almost 100bn. 

- Healthcare: 122bn or +2%, contribution was 0.21p, biotech and pharma were mostly down.

- Commodities & Utilities: 69bn or +1.9%, 0.12pc contribution, where utilities declined and growth was generated by oil & gas and metals.

- Transportation & Communications: 55 bln or +3.3%, 0.09 p.p. contribution.

The breakout of the isthmus with record momentum at very high rates and the market rising broadly is a reversal pattern, just as it was in the bubble of 2021, 2000 and 1929.; Yet it makes about 3 dollars a share.

So honestly this is the best chance we now have to see a robotaxi in 2026. Same applies to spacex; I would suggest you did exactly the right thing. 

Hindsight is lovely but betting on Tesla at those valuations was borderline gambling. Just because it landed on red 3 times doesn't make the decision wrong to call it quits.; Sus; Next presidency will be when Tesla is full blown AI valuation with robotaxis deployed everywhere.

But Elon is now in the white house and can do whatever he likes so its rises nothing to do about the company itself; my guy, this has been the TSLA rhetoric.

Wealth is power, I'm not so sure that it's as clear cut as Elon being in Trump's orbit as they'll orbit each other in some ways. They both have ways of making each other's lives more difficult (slightly, because their both in the class of being mostly untouchable in the grand scheme of things), and they're both incredibly petty and pigheaded so from a very dissociative perspective, this will be interesting to watch.; 700% is just overwhelmingly impressive, kudos man. but why not hold probably a minority such as 1/5 to see what happens next. For now I dont expect Tesla to crash a lot in the next four years; You are right, but eventually the valuation matters still right?; I thought Trump was anti EVs though.

The self dealing is going to be disgusting.; [deleted]; > More like the president that weaponized the government against Musk's companies is finally gone.

I think you are confused

Under Trump's first term:

- Federal EV credits expired, impacting Tesla's margins

- Trump's SEC fined Elon and Tesla $20M each, and removed him as Chairman of the Company (for the 'funding secured' tweet fraud).

under Biden:

- federal EV credits were restored, helping Tesla weather the economic headwinds of the 2020 fallout

- no other Federal action was taken against any Musk company

>  He was bullied in school and learned the hard way the only way to deal with bullies is to fight back.

Also false -- his father didn't jump to his defense because the actual fact was that Elon was the bully - teasing a classmate whose father had recently committed suicide, and his classmates didn't care for his bullying.

I don't know that much about options, but I'd think a long dated put wouldn't be destroyed if you think there's no way it can maintain this valuation for more than 9 months; If there’s one company I’ve seen you should never short, it’s Tesla; Who’s bringing the popcorn when this ends badly for trying to short it?; Make sure to use margin.; Secretary of transportation Elon lmao; [deleted]; Or the best system if you just inverse reddit; [removed]; Trump won; The direction of the stock hasn't matched the direction of the company the last few years. It was coiled up and ready to run.; Who cares about market analysis. The only thing that matters is the market. And your out of touch with it; It worked because TSLA is a great company with strong leadership.  The propaganda on here rotted peoples brains.; I've made more money doing this shit than research.; if youre into EVs long term tesla is the stock to have, thats purely logical.; Thats what I have done! I am up 18% this year, which is still less than sp500.; Most true comment on reddit. I too remember when they said that after the great firing twitter will shut down in a week because they dont have the engineers to run it anymore. LMAO.; X still makes no revenue because what big-name advertiser would want to be associated with Elon who is pushing racist conspiracy theories daily? Of course Elon is okay with losing money because he gets to spread misinformation on a platform where he has control of the algorithm. Not that it really matters when he’s made $50 billion in three days since Trump got elected; To be frank advertisers have fled and the overall product has become a mess with bots and porn running rampant no verification process. It's been shit.; It's a bigger echo chamber than even twitter was before Elon bought it. It seems these days reddit is solely comprised of refugees from twitter and tumblr. People divorced from reality.; The people here are truly idiots.  This is the worst platform on the internet.; Bro once again turned out to be the Kwisatz Haderach of South Africa and people in here still be like ""But eets just a cahr companieeeeee"".; It’s gonna hurt when Trump get angry at Musk and kick him out; Tesla will probably blow past $2 trillion in a year or 2.

!remindme in 2 years.; Regular taxi’s do last mile personal transportation.

*(Side note, logistics focused companies are less prone to complete idiocy; and they are looking into automation on major freeways/transport networks between hubs, and last mile will still be executed by people… I wonder why.)*

All self driven cars are shown in car park test courses and freeways and have shown no effort in addressing the complexities of winding roads with variable maintained infrastructure (obscured road signs, missing road markings, leaves… etc) or, variable road conditions, intense rain, snow, ice etc. Uber drivers can attach chains etc to provide a service in difficult conditions, how’s Mr AI going to do that? 

A taxi driver can also navigate when GPS signal / cell service is out.

This isn’t a regulatory hurdle, it’s a 0 to 1 engineering problem gone completely unaddressed.

Unless of course they plan to enter the non-existent (or minuscule value) market of long distance taxis (buses/trains/planes exist btw…) that need to drop you off to a real taxi to perform last mile transportation
- adding value by increasing inconvenience and cost… uhhh 😬 🤔… that will sell billions!; Feel free to remind me every year for the next 10 years… 😘

Id almost be tempted to wager, if there were any point.; so many losers on this site have already made up their mind about the ceo/company w/o looking at the facts. Dont even try to help them make money.; Tesla will be a $3T market cap based on EV sales and energy storage alone. Now you can buy and hold with conviction. If robotaxis or bots happen, then probably $10T.; I'm pretty happy considering the SPY has moved under 10% in the same amount of time. (I invested in late July)

  
Calling this bragging would be an overstatement.; In the history of investment, stocks have never been valued based on past results.

Stock prices are a reflection of what the market thinks a company looks like in the future.

Right now Tesla has no debt, years ahead of any other EV manufactor in the West, already built brand new plants with the most modern technology, and America just elected a house, senate and president that will work in the best interest of Elon Musk and Tesla.

There are good reasons as to why the market is bullish on Tesla, whether they can accomplish results in the future is of course an unknown, but thats literally what every stock investing is like. Some companies fail to meet expectations = shares fall, some companies suceed to meet expectations = shares rises.; \>stock should be below $200 based on past results

Good thing I value stocks based on expected future performance and not past performance. This kind of thinking is what caused people to miss the boat on Apple and Nvidia. Don't pay too much credence to P/E.; Well I invested starting around July. I didn't hold any in January.; That’s what people said when it was at 100bil then at 200, 300, 400bil (but really for sure now)… 700.. IT WILL CRASH ANY TIME NOW GUYS. 
Who the fuck cares. It makes us big money. This is a stock subreddit, not your political Wordpress blog.; RemindMe! 10 Years Come back to laugh at this person; Stop crying because you missed the Tesla rally; Damn now Tesla as a whole is a scam. Deranged.; I'm aware of the history and didn't touch it until I read about them switching to a neural net approach in 2023. Now I actually strongly believe they will achieve these goals.; When he says “Crash the Economy”, he means Crush the competition.  Tesla will go unscathed, and will probably be there to buy up the competition, which the Elon SEC will allow to happen.; TSLA isn't an electric car company, it's a self-driving car company that happens to make electric cars. 

To be frank, it's positioned extremely well to rake in money by turning their cars into a subscription model, and positioned extremely well by having the next admin approve his self-driving software to be the first allowed on the road. The only problem is their QC is off and they make cars glitchier than a Bethesda game.; Bailout who though, Detroit still sucks though ; You mean the competing social media site that Trump has no financial interest in?

And Hannity/Tucker never asked for the things that Elon will be. He also has a couple billion to repay the oil industry.; Yeah, maybe it's a little bit of wishcasting, but then I remember that Putin is ten times the autocrat Trump could ever be, and he still had his former right hand man leading a convoy of troops towards Moscow this year. Tom Cruise tried to assassinate Hitler.

Gonna be a helluva 4 years of chaos. I'm surprised the markets don't see that.; My goal when buying these Tesla shares was to eventually be able to buy a Tesla/other car as a downpayment or fund the entire car with my profit. My goal was reached after the pump when Trump was announced! I need a car in the next month and I wanted to secure this profit in case it crashes for whatever reason on Monday, next week, next month, etc when I planned on using this profit for a specific purpose. 

But In hindsight, I agree. I should have kept a few! I can always buy back if it dips is my mindset right now; If you hit your sale price, sell. You think it will double at this point?; first time?; In 4 years; I dont know if you've been following but valuation hasn't really mattered for the last several years; He has 100 million reasons to change his mind; He’s never been against EVs, he’s just against subsidizing them afaik.; >  thought Trump was anti EVs though.

No hes not. Why did you think that?; It would be drastically more confusing if Trump started saying things and then those things in the future ended up being consistent with his later actions. 

If he says ""I hate chocolate ice cream"" the only future scenario that would make sense to me, which wouldn't be confusing, is if we saw buckets and buckets of chocolate ice cream in his freezer and his face covered in melted chocolate.; Drain the swamp to refill it with sychophants; That's funny.; Well at least Herschel Walker will be in charge of the US missile defense shield 

https://newschannel9.com/amp/news/local/trump-says-hell-task-herschel-walker-with-missile-defense-shield-if-elected-presidential-election-white-house-politics-iron-dome-military-armed-forces; You already saw what happens when Betsy DeVos was head of the department of education.; I predict RFK will make note of all the corruption and then a year later he'll reveal it all to the media. The president will get impeached. Elon will go to jail. RFK will be glorified by the democrats. 

I tell ya, Trump is an idiot keeping RFK around. Yes, RFK is a bit wacko if you ask me, but he does seem to care about right and wrong. 100% he'll be the whistleblower.; Genuine question. What does one have to believe to think RFK in charge of the FDA is a bad thing? Aside from the negative impact on corrupt rich people at big pharma, I can't think of any reason anyone wouldn't want to see this?; Is that what’s going to happen? Or will he have to relinquish ownership if hes in a cabinet spot?; Elon can now push for regulation that only benefits TESLA, like requiring all gas stations with Tesla chargers or have 2025 car specs that is already optimize for tesla cars or get rid of regulations around labor laws.; Immediate snark without providing anything of substance. Classic redditor.; Again… corruption has a meaning. What corruption has happened?; It'll benefit even if the Trump government does literally nothing since the current administration is literally weaponizing government institutions against him.; Let’s take a few concrete examples.

Biden promoted clean energy. Solar companies benefited, initially, from his position. They endorsed him, and promoted him to voters. Is that corruption?

Now, Biden ended up betraying much of the solar industry in the U.S. by choking off their main source of solar modules… raising tariffs by 4x to over 100%. I see Biden as someone that went back on his promises of taking urgent action against climate change.

He also promoted the UAW. the UAW endorsed him, promoted his candidacy, and helped elect him. He appointed people to the NRLB that are pro-UAW. Biden helped as much as he could push UAW agenda. Is that corruption?; I remember you from the Tsla investor sub days! Still an investor or not anymore?; I know, it's great to see.; I love u tho. Jerking off to you licking musky hole ; Imagine saying the same thing about NVDA or LLY last year and buying puts.; Last time Tesla was near ATH I read on Reddit about some whales entering huge short positions. They made big money but I was hesitant cause of all those lunatics buying TSLA at 300$. Not gonna make that mistake again.; Nana?  Is that you?; With risk management it won’t end bad. Just a trade; Ik it’s just memes… but there’s probably a real chance of Elon becoming a part of government and major decision making in the near future; Tesla is the only western EV maker that can sell decent EVs without the credits.

Bad for Tesla means legacy is already bankrupt/ unable to sell EVs; this

what else does reddit hate besides TSLA and BTC? 🤔; The reddit IPO literally netted me 300%.; Honestly I'd rather be lucky than good.; Lmao, yeah great leadership means your stock pumps 20%+ based on the election of a man who has been outspokenly against your industry; Yeah, stagnating revenue, ungodly high P/E ratio, unfulfilled promises, and Elon just revealed last month that he invented a bus, but worse. 

How can someone really think it's driven up by intrinsic value and strong future growth outlooks? It's a meme stock, the Elon ETF. 

Not saying the company doesn't have any real value unlike other meme stocks, but how can you honestly justify it being 1T in actual value?; Imagine be being this detached from reality. I’ve made money on Tesla several times, but come on. Let’s be honest; And the downvotes continue to keep Reddit users ignorant. We're gonna be so fucking rich.; That’s fair. Value investors have gotten brutally punished this year; You know which advertisers use X? ALL OF THEM. Because they just want to sell people shit they dont give a fuck about morality.; You're here.; He owns X. Which is a powerful tool when the rest of the mainstream media is left leaning. Essentially it’s a mutually beneficial relationship. Trump needs X and Elon needs a government that won’t attack him or his companies.; I was thinking a squeeze to $3T and another number of years consolidating there. Probably starting next year? I'm ready for whenever; you are underestimating technology progress. that will negatively affect your portfolio. missing out. I sense a Steve Ballmer on iPhone vibes... no keyboard! (inconvenient and added cost) Very short sighted; Have you tried fsd? Its on a free trial and ive been using it definitely does last mile driving. And has improved drastically; You can, go short the stock; Completely agree. Don’t worry you would have also been downvoted in 2019 😂; In the past (12 months ago) Teslas future (current day) looked like shit given its high stock price and falling growth. 

Now, Tesla is still not growing and its valuation is even higher. Teslas only hope to fill its massive valuation is solve FSD, something no one has done yet. And there’s no guarantee of it.

Tesla is overpriced, and arguably always has been over the last few years outside of a few buying opportunities.

I believe in Tesla, not so much faith in TSLA at these prices.; The big issue is for a car company priced like its a growth stock, their car sales aren't growing and competition is hotter than ever. The cars used to be the best EVs, now they're not. The self driving thing is the only advantage they have, the actual car fit and finish etc is crap, and people hate the lack of indicator stalks and other buttons. 

I used to want a Tesla now and saw them as great cars, now when I sit in them (Uber) they look and feel cheap, especially the model 3 which seems cheaper and less nice to be in than a Honda Civic.; 12 months ago the future of Tesla looked like shit, and it was shit. The stock didn’t have a good year, until these last few months thanks to nothing.

You don’t buy based on the future, otherwise you wouldn’t have bought Tesla anywhere above $150; I will be messaging you in 10 years on [**2034-11-08 15:35:36 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2034-11-08%2015:35:36%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gmkxwf/tesla_hits_1t_market_cap_for_the_first_time_since/lw3cx7b/?context=3)

|-|-|-|-|; Tell me your Degree and job right now, so I know if you can comprehend basic informations; What crying, I invested heavily in Tech companies in the last 5 years i couldnt care less, but tell me how this valuation makes sense for tesla, they dont have self driving and are way behind waymo, their robotics are legit guys in suits or with a mic behind the counter, the only thing they are is a car company with a charger network that doesnt fit the valuation; Ok where is the promised 2016 self driving ? Their ""fully automotous "" robots that will be according to musk a 30 trillion markat cap are just guys in a suit and with interns talking in a mic; This time is surely different. But maybe it doesn't have to be to make gains. DJT has billions market cap.; No, Elon literally said “brace for economic hardship” 

https://www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/kaboom-elon-musk-predicts-hardship-economic-turmoil-and-a-stock-market-crash-if-trump-wins-20483008

They’re going to crash it and buy everything for pennies lol; Truth Social is tiny in comparison. X has a much wider reach. Musk himself is also a prominent right-wing influencer by now. It's just not comparable to someone like Rex Tillerson, Trump would pay a real price if he did break up with him.; The markets aren't really based in reality very often. It's a mixture of financial fact, people trying to predict other's behavior and outright manipulation. Just look at the AMC/Gamestop shit, or for a more sustained example, Tesla. They've been way overvalued for a long long time based on pure speculation and fanboyism, in reality they've missed many marks theyve set out to hit that would have cratered other companies without that social momentum. The people who understand that further drive it by also investing when it otherwise wouldnt make sense to.; That's what I said four years ago.; That’s the weird part about him, everyone just assumes what they want and ignores what he says.; depends on what you mean by ""against EVs"" 

https://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47/agenda47-rescuing-americas-auto-industry-from-joe-bidens-disastrous-job-killing-policies; He proposed a total EV ban at one point in this campaign before he started taking that sweet sweet immigrant money from Elon

Edit: i stand corrected on the total EV ban. But the other portion is 100% the truth. He changed his mind on things after he started taking Elon money, specifically stating ""I'm for electric cars, I have to be because Elon endorsed me very strongly""

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/05/trump-endorses-electric-vehicles-elon-musk; This is certainly going to be a cabinet of all time.; Putin is absolutely laughing his ass off right now; I literally can’t lol; Average redditors wet dream; wut; Lol you need to make a post on r/markmywords; Wasn't this the same fantasy in 2016 where people say Trump is undercover liberal and will destroy the corruption and drain the swamp after being elected?; They are both compromised by Russia.  They will do as they are told.; Why would he have to relinquish ownership?; > like requiring all gas stations with Tesla charger

Tesla doesn't even need that since their own supercharger network is much more beneficial to them & guess what? They've opened up their network to other manufacturers and standardised their chargers.; Or no tariffs on teslas; The big one -- Tesla has been selling FullSelfDriving to customers but it is still in beta so they haven't recognized all of that income yet.

If Elon gets all of the NHTSA fired from the Dept of Transportation, and he has a direct say in the writing of the national autonomous vehicle regulations, then Tesla FSD can be auto-approved nationwide with no red tape / regardless of safety, and TSLA is undervalued (they can then recognize all of that income, the uncertainty about if they will every get regulatory approval goes away); Laws can’t be written for specific companies.

Biden tried to pass the EV tax credit with a booster for union built vehicles. It got taken out because Sinema objected to that (Lucid is non-union)

So you didn’t point any actual corruption.; They're in full meltdown mode.; Don't be regarded we all know if Elon gets into any sort of power he will cut whatever department is in charge of regulations so he can do whatever he likes without anyone telling him no

His whole FSD fraud is based on the ""It's coming next year if regulations allow it"" shtick since 2014; Buying a politician using $150 Million of your own money and expecting favorable treatment is corruption. 

It's a transaction deal, the currency of sociopaths. 

That's the only kind of deal Trump does. What Elon manboy expects for his bribery is special treatment, anything he ask for approves without regulation or restriction or scrutiny. 

He wants the ability to alter power all over the planet and is using his money to do so, knowing corrupt people all have a price and can be bought.

He's a mini Trump who no one ever says no too, and threatens anyone who gets in his way or criticizes him.; Here’s a specific one, spending hundreds of millions on a campaign and getting a role in the cabinet and a lot of influence, that is one. Tell me why this isn’t corruption now?; [removed]; [deleted]; The UAW isn’t a business, it’s a labor union, a political entity. Their fundamental purpose is to demonstrate the common interest of a block of voters to politicians in order to ensure that said politicians will acknowledge the group’s needs. They are not receiving kickbacks, but participating in democracy; equating them with a private business is inane.; > raising tariffs by 4x to over 100%.

The US solar industry was devastated in the past by cheaper / unfairly priced / China-subsidized panels

First Solar seems to be doing fine in 2024 https://apnews.com/article/biden-solar-inflation-reduction-act-dca914675cd0855004214d82aab5b10c; Send pics.; Those are real businesses that are profitable and growing; Last time it was at $300 you could've shorted almost any stock and would've made money.

Did we just forget about the 2022 bear market? That wasn't a Tesla event.; Sounds like you're about to make another mistake no matter what.; Don’t be the first one to do it. Wait for Trump to take office and see if anything benefitting TSLA comes to pass. Also earnings in 2025 for yoy comparisons to make that pe look even more ridiculous.; Yeah Elon has only isolated himself against Half the country who were the real people buying his cars. He has an FSD tech not proven, unproven robots… but he is riding trumps dick. So bullish lol

Market can stay stupid for longer than you.; Probably gonna make a new position for him, and Elon will then have some clout over all the other cabinet secretaries.  Tsla 2T cap by 2026.; PYPL; Rddt. Funny how that works out; Nvidia. Reddit has a visceral hatred towards the stock, and for years now the consensus on Reddit was that it was ""overvalued and a bubble"". 

So glad I didn't listen to Reddit, I've done very well with Nvidia.  ; Anything with a high multiple; Things change. Alliances change, loyalties change. This is the real world.; RemindMe! 1 year; According to my quick Google search Tesla had profits of 15b in 2023, a lot of money but very far from 1t. 

In contrast Microsoft had a 146b profit and Aramco* 121b profit in 2023.

I think it's safe to say that Tesla is overvalued in the stockmarket, question is just how much and will the popularity of Elon keep it there.

I suppose one could argue that it's actually Elon that is worth a lot of money.; When does a meme stock stop being a meme and just become the new accepted reality? Where is the cutoff? I mean GME was clearly a meme stock and its fall reflects that. Tesla just keeps going, like BTC.; Let's see. RemindMe! 1 year; https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2024/09/05/business/advertisers-x-withdrawal. That’s just laughably easy to disprove.; You seriously think Trump care? He won he don’t need anyone support from anymore. Plus X not that much beneficial for him since a lot of people hate him and Musk there; Just a slight squeeze to 3 trillion lmao. what a joke; Unlikely to be very smart to short a high volatility stock for two years 🙄; I didn't buy into Tesla until July of this year. I also thought it looked like shit a year ago.; I'm a lead business analyst/software PM with a degree in Finance and management of information systems.; For “someone who couldn’t care less” you post an awful lot about Tesla 😂; It is by far the most successful electric vehicle company. End of story. It is not a scam just because they miss some deadlines. Don't let your hate fo Elon cloud your entire judgment.; This time is absolutely different. Neural nets and the rise of accelerated compute is a game changer. Either way, I don't really care if I convince you.; And when did Trump ever start making logical decisions balancing the pros and cons of his actions?; I wouldn’t be surprised if they come up with some way to merge em. Elon more than once tried to get Trump to “come back” to Twitter.; I am obviously not a stock market guru; otherwise, I would have enough money to stop caring about stocks.; wrong; It's legit Idiocracy and its not even a funny similarity, like it's the literal cabinet from the movie. America is cooked and deserves everything coming to it.; clowns. the whole lot of them.; You still believe that nonsense? Even left-wing media admitted it was a hoax by the Hillary campaign years ago.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/11/23/steele-dossier-igor-danchenko-indictment-scrutiny/; Legal requirement. Well that's if the law matters any more which isn't to clear it does.; I'm pretty sure they have recognized the vast majority of the FSD income if not all.; Nahh, not until they storm to Capitol to “save” democracy.; Yeah man, Tesla jumped $80 since November 5th because ...reasons.  It might just be vibes, but you're already hearing stories about Elon screwing with Taiwan because he's likely trying to trade favors with China.; Point to the action taken this past week that is corruption. You otherwise making a conjecture about the future.

Hundreds of thousands of people are using FSD every day.; Again, what corruption has happened?; Very specifically, point to how this is different than any other Democrat administration before.; He is probably asking for a government contract where all new vehicles bought by the federal government must be electric. Made in the US, more specifically by a company headquartered in Texas.
Something substantial like that.; Again, what corruption has happened?

How is this different than financiers and vote getters for Biden getting posts and favorable treatment?; [removed]; No, Biden administration absolutely abused its power to go after Musk.

I say that as someone that voted for Biden and voted for Harris.

But I am not a blind follower as quite a few others are out there.; You do know that both parties have massive funding in the millions from individual donors. SuperPACs don’t need to disclose their funding.

So, how exactly is Musk different here? Seems it’s only because you don’t like him that you find particular fault, when the game has been played this way for decades.; I am invested in FSLR…

Previously, the U.S. solar module manufacturers were devastated. But that ship has sailed. The vast revenue and workforce leaders in the U.S. solar industry are the installers and investors, and they were hurt bad by Biden’s solar tariffs. If climate change is an urgent existential risk, then why choke off the primary supply of the cheapest top tier solar modules? Domestic production will take years to bring online, and even when they do, the prices per watt will increase, which means less solar installed per $. If climate change action is so important, why do this?; Tesla dropped from 350€ to almost a 100€....at some point even TSLA had to catch up with reality and crashed much harder than other stocks.; I'm again waiting for some whales to jump in.... right now I think there is too much room left to climb.

When people to start get delusional about it, which will probaly come and fundamental dont change, thats the entry point.; He sided with trump to remove regulations around the red tape the government imposes on his endeavors. Can’t hate the player, hate the game.; ✍️; if reddit created a good search engine, and did some data science work... I'd be hella bullish; 300%; Next you're going to say DJT is such a great businessman because he's able to get a company with $1M in revenue and $20M in expenses to a $7B market cap. That's the market rewarding great leadership, not obviously manipulation and corruption; Tesla is a growth stock. MSFT has been in business for 40 years.; As long as it's still the Elon ETF. How much do you think it would drop if he decided to resign or if he passed away tomorrow? 50, 60, 70% maybe?; At this point it brought Elon political influence. Which is bigger than valuations. Especially with his net worth. I’ve talked to conservatives and they believe Elon buying X saved the Republican Party from the liberal mainstream media. 

Whether that’s true or not matters less than what people believe. And the influence gained could help Tesla and space x enough to more than offset any losses from the actual X platform; Trump is very egotistical. He wants to go down as the best president of all time. That won’t happen with an unfriendly media. 

He also probably wants long term success of republicans. And X is valuable for that; [https://imgur.com/a/hD6M2Uq](https://imgur.com/a/hD6M2Uq)

RemindMe! 2 years; Thanks for your comments. The day I see Tesla bears put their money where their mouth is, is the day I sell. But in the meantime, as long as they’re still scared, I still hold!; Well there ya go

Your wording made it sound like you originally bought years ago

Congrats on the gains; Ok then explain me, this whole marcet cap is based that tesla solves self driving and robotics, if they dont do this they are a car company, so lets look at self driving according to musk it should have come 2016 and it doesnt look like they will beat waymo anytime soon, when they are not level 4 quite anytime also they faked videos about their self driving, so why would we belive a word they say, now about robotics their robots are legit guys in a costume dancing and now in the last presentation it were inters talking with the guest with a mic XD, my old mindstome roboter was more usefull; Why cant you give counter points to my stances ? and instead write emojis in a subreddit about stocks less feelings more facts please; I hope it works out. I m not touching it at 150 PE, unless its a short; I think you are too much in your ""Trump is **obviously** a moron"" reddit bubble. The guy is definitely not stupid when it comes to interpersonal relationships. He maintained good relationships with a lot of his former enemies, once that benefitted him.; If there’s one thing Trump does, it’s abide by the law!; Elon isn't going to be a member of Trump's cabinet. He'll be in some unofficial made up role.; I don’t think relinquishing *ownership* is a legal requirement considering Trump didn’t have to do it in his first term, nor do cabinet secretaries. Even congress can still own stock, they just have more restrictions than the White House. 

He probably won’t stay CEO though, but he can just put a puppet in who does what he says. Same shit Trump did with his kids.; Are you people not aware stuff like this has been happening for decades if not longer?; The government has been on top of Musk's companies for a while now, the fact that's not gonna be a risk for 4 years is obviously pushing it's value up.; The *market* is making that conjecture.; Keep your head buried in the sand and let your new corporate overlord to plow you.; Okay then you agree it is corruption, don’t know why you had a hard time understanding it.

Tell me one person in Biden’s cabinet who donated millions and got a cabinet role?; So if Biden has some electric vehicle purchase mandates… that’s corruption?

They bought UAW built EVs.; >No, Biden administration absolutely abused its power to go after Musk.

No, they didn't, and you'll never find one example they did.

>I say that as someone that voted for Biden and voted for Harris.

Doesn't seem to make you any less of an idiot.

>But I am not a blind follower as quite a few others are out there.

Just saying it doesn't make it so, an obvious truth you seem to struggle with.; [deleted]; Meta dropped more than Tesla did and so did Netflix.

Again, this was not a Tesla phenomenon.; Well im praying it backfires and tesla proves it self to be just another car company. And all the people holding longs up here get screwed.; Trump derangement syndrome detected.; One of the top 10 highest valued companies in the fucking world just needs to grow. Why is Tesla valued as highly as companies that has grown? The 2 I looked at roughly 9x Teslas profit too.

Toyota had a profit of 45b if you want a car company for comparison.; Just goes to show how important good leadership is ;); You’re 100% right. Republicans don't realize that they are the mainstream now. If you look at the charts they have all of the top podcasts and youtube channels now. Theo Von and Joe Rogan got hundreds of millions of viewers interviewing Trump while tossing him absolute softballs. It’s embarrassing that voters are so easily influenced by social media today but there’s nothing anyone can do about it I guess.; Ah I see that i failed to mention it in my original comment. No, I agree that it looked like shit years ago. I didn't want to touch it then.; I'm aware of Musk's overly optimistic bs he has said in the past. I never bought into that. What I did buy into is that they will achieve these goals with their new neural net approach. (Thanks to the Nvidia/ChatGPT Revolution)

Waymo is fine but considering it costs them 300k to make a single vehicle, and they have a much worse supply chain, they will be crushed by Tesla's ability to scale.

Take emotion and your personal thoughts of Musk's timelines out of the equation and it really is fairly clear.

But, again, the fact that you are under this false impression is why this is an opportunity and the most undervalued AI play in the market.; Why the fuck would I have to provide counter arguments. I like the company, I like the cars, I like robots, I like the ambition. As you can literally see, nobody invests in Tesla based on their current fundamentals, but other than literally every other car manufacturer out there they have a vision, ambition, Ai, willingness to fail, a ceo who doesn’t give a fuck, they’re thinking out of the box with shit like the cybertruck. That’s what I value and not the 17th facelift model of a same Audi A5 \ bmw 1. What can expect from ford or Mercedes? The only thing I hear about them is 50 LinkedIn posts a day sucking each others dicks because the new c-class comes with a slightly different front now.; Well it's fun to hold it either way. Exciting times!; I mean, three quarters of his last cabinet hate is guts. I'm gonna guess the ratio won't be that much different this time.; There was a whole stink about his business when it did happen last time. I'm pretty sure he even had to relinquish control and put his business in a blind trust. Think his son ran it.; Can you name a specific historical example that reminds you of this?; The market is short covering.; So you have nothing.

To go with your flow, did you enjoy getting plowed by the UAW?

When GM, Ford, and Stellantis go under and lay off thousands (which has started already) due to structural uncompetitiveness due to UAW labor contracts, remember Biden.; Musk has been appointed to a cabinet role?

And since PAC funding is mostly secret, how would you know wrt Biden’s cabinet?

Again, corruption has a very specific meaning.; It's not, I was being sarcastic. It becomes corruption if the government creates a rule that all bought vehicles satisfy a condition that only Teslas meet.
BTW, fuck UAW.; It seems you don’t have the proper history. But then again, I would be surprised if you did. It’s all out there, but you let others frame things for you rather than use your own brain.; Biden orchestrated the pulling of the rural broadband subsides to SpaceX.

Biden pushed UAW allies onto the NRLB that made ridiculous rulings. Note only GM, Ford, and Stellantis had UAW organized factories for most of Biden’s term.

Biden raised the tariffs on EV and solar parts to over 100%. 

Biden’s appointed a NASA administrator that was anti-commercial space and preferred the boondoggle that is SLS, soaking up huge amounts of taxpayer money for nearly zero use. He continued with weaponizing the FAA with delays that end up making zero actual changes, just paperwork and delays.

Biden’s is close allies with the Delaware judge that went after Musk’s compensation package in a ridiculous ruling that made a mockery of the judicial process and shareholder’s rights. Shareholders voted to affirm the original vote again. Her premise for ruling is so deeply flawed, but you won’t hear the full story because the media has a vested interest to not tell you. Plus, you likely won’t want to hear it anyways.

Biden, at every turn, attempted to promote UAW related interests, which includes passing a IRA tax credit that pushes PHEVs over BEVs because of the UAW. The UAW has been anti-BEVs because their workforce doesn’t make many BEVs… Those companies and UAW workforce want to have a slower EV transition.. hence, the shift in product plans in the past 2 years.

There’s much more.; I gave examples… and the history is there to be examined by anyone curious enough.; 27 P/E vs 81 P/E, the latter of which is been juiced heavily in the past week in large part because of sentiment from the election.

It's a Tesla phenomenon, and it won't last.; Got 4 years to know.  If it ends with Elon landing a rocket on mars with a Tesla driving around on the surface while trump is president all the “suffering” people have won’t matter during this period.; Tesla semi fsd will get deregulated and it’ll be hilarious when the trucking industry gets dismantled; Me too but I can't see it crashing in the near term. 

He's positioned himself shoulder to shoulder with Trump to influence government legislation to benefit himself, not even counting the efficiency role which I'm sure will direct more power and wealth into his pocket.  

Unfortunately, the US population may be guinea pigs for his daft ideas; People have been praying and coping about buying twitter backfiring as well. That was probably the smartest move Elon has made maybe ever.; I mean if that's what you want to call people with functioning brains, sure; I wouldn't say good leadership is becoming a cult like figure that does and says completely random shit.

Improving your company is good leadership. Is having slow or no growth at all, making empty promises over and over again and putting out very few new, actually good products in years improving the company?

A goofy ass truck and a bus but way worse being the long awaited robotaxi is just a hilarious output for a 1T company in the last few years. Only thing of real value is the developments in the energy and battery side of the business; You actually dont have a clue about what you are talking about, every company that develops self driving has some maschine lerning approach and that has not a lot to do with ChatGPT or nivida revolution besides computing power besides there is no way they will ever catch up to waymo if they dont have sensors. Your second point is actually a fair point but if they archive full self driving, they could just license it to established car companies because at that point its just small changes and adding a few more sensors and cameras that is easy to do. If i take emotions out of my timeline it seems even worse because they are not even level 4 quite jet; So you just invest because of feelings that is your god giving right but then dont fucking talk like you would understand anything technical about this company.; It was his first time in office and he hired a bunch of neo con douche bags. Once he realized they sucked at their job, he fired them. Then they got butt hurt and made up a bunch on nonsense lies.

Kamala's staff absolutely hates her but they can't go to 99% of the media because it would be against their own interests to report anything negative about the Biden/Harris admin. 

Trump has incredible friends for decades. I hate to break it to you but a lot of people like the man and he likes people. Not everywhere is reddit. Trump won the popular vote and the electoral college. You should wonder why.; Biden’s Secretary of Defense was a Raytheon board member, to provide one example. There are countless examples of this across defense, pharmaceuticals and the financial sector.; I’ll also add that the example I provided is a substantially worse conflict of interest than Elon. One has an incentive to get us into wars, and the other has an incentive to subsidize electric cars.; Of what? So far, as far as we know at least, nothing Redditors are scaring themselves into thinking has happened. Trump isn’t president yet. Musk could be an advisor or the Fed chairman for all we know. The “revolving door” has been around for a century though. 

Our current defense secretary was on the board of Raytheon of all companies lmao.; TSLA Short Interest % Float is 2.84%.

This rally is not driven by short covering.; The GM CEO got paid 30 million last year…. Keep blaming the labour unions and ignore the real problems…. Im sure Elon musk is going to fix everything for you. Give him exclusive control over everything and he’ll save you! Like how protecting HD by giving them exclusive markets saved Harley Davidson from the Japanese dominating the industry. 

Your delusion and complete dissociation from reality just goes to show that Americans truly deserve whatever comes to them in the long run…
 
I don’t have any dogs in this , good luck to you.; You are truly an a brainwashed idiot.

>Biden orchestrated the pulling of the rural broadband subsides to SpaceX.

[During the COVID-19 pandemic, federal lawmakers launched the Affordable Connectivity Program with the goal of connecting more people to their jobs, schools, and doctors. More than 23 million low-income households, including Broncho’s, eventually signed on. The program provided $30 monthly subsidies for internet bills, or $75 discounts in tribal or high-cost areas like Broncho’s.](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/06/03/nx-s1-4978902/affordable-connectivity-program-broadband-rural-telehealth)

He didn't orchestrate anything you dope.

>Biden pushed UAW allies onto the NRLB that made ridiculous rulings. Note only GM, Ford, and Stellantis had UAW organized factories for most of Biden’s term.

Not one single ""ridiculous"" ruling you can cite that's intended to punish Elon.

>Biden raised the tariffs on EV and solar parts to over 100%.

While extending EV credits and subsidizing solar panel manufacturing while extending tax credits to solar panels buyers.

>Biden’s appointed a NASA administrator that was anti-commercial space and preferred the boondoggle that is SLS, soaking up huge amounts of taxpayer money for nearly zero use. He continued with weaponizing the FAA with delays that end up making zero actual changes, just paperwork and delays.

The same NASA that's spending more money than ever on SpaceX? NASA is so dependent on SpaceX it's become a national security concern. They literally had no backup plan for when Falcon 9 was grounded temporarily.

>Biden’s is close allies with the Delaware judge that went after Musk’s compensation package in a ridiculous ruling that made a mockery of the judicial process and shareholder’s rights.

Literally none of that is true. Musk's own emails mentioned he was negotiating with himself"" to get that package because the BOD were all his hand picked creatures. She was appointed by the Governor of Delaware you halfwit.

>Shareholders voted to affirm the original vote again. Her premise for ruling is so deeply flawed, but you won’t hear the full story because the media has a vested interest to not tell you. Plus, you likely won’t want to hear it anyways.

You won't hear it because it doesn't exist, except as a figment of your imagination. The media didn't invent Elon's emails.

>There’s much more.

Much more bullshit from another bullshit artist. You clearly have to be drinking some potent chemicals to think the world's richest man is a victim.; ""It"" being its price right now? Sure.

I'm just talking about the 2022 drop the previous guy mentioned.; yep he was able to control the stupidity of the mob and bend them to his will. elon wins.; I made money today on TSLA.  Did you?  Who is the dumb one?; Well I placed my bets and I'm quite confident. Check back in a decade later.; Your “technical understanding” missed out on becoming a millionaire investing into Tesla. I’ll take my gut feeling any day lmao.; lol this guy proved you wrong and you double down on “hurr durr it’s Reddit”; That data is always dated… and it doesn’t reflect the options OI and the resulting delta hedging shift.; Ah, what does CEO pay have to do with this? Do you have any idea how much GM’s payroll is overall?

Tesla is fine without protections… it’s Biden that has been adding protectionism. Tesla is competing worldwide with few home grown protections… unlike Chinese companies in China for instance. Or how Germany helps German automakers with public policy in the EU and the fact that some are partially government owned. Even the way most vehicles in Germany are bought on fleet contracts that favor German companies is not replicated for Tesla. And Tesla gets zero favoritism in the U.S., it just plays by the rules.

If Democrats can’t wake up to reality, they will continue to lose elections.; Bro this is the average American voter you're dealing with. Even one supposedly on the Democrat side, they just hear some blurb they FEEL is right or read some headline and roll with that as if it were 100% fact. Then someone like you, who values truth and accuracy, uses references to explain why the original view is wrong, and all you'll get is silence. That guy won't come away from this discussion having learned anything, and this is a voter from the more educated party? I used to wonder how Americans fell for the shit they did and now I have no questions about it. Proud ignorance is this country's baseline, we are just finally seeing how widespread and endemic it is.; Then that's neither here nor there, since the point is Tesla's price is juiced right now.; Best business decision for him ever. I think it's best to stop praying something happens that tanks shares due to your own bias. Like NVDA bears coping and seething too, they just missed the boat and did not see nor believed the vision the CEO had in mind.; It’s easy to make money in the market, it’s hard to keep it.; Nah it will rise a lot because musk sits in the white house, that doesnt change the fact that its not a ""good company""; yeah you could also have become a millionaire investing in gamestop doesnt mean its logical ???"
"r/Stocks Daily Discussion & Fundamentals Friday Nov 08, 2024","This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on fundamentals, but if fundamentals aren't your thing then just ignore the theme.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Lmaooo; If you want a stock that goes down 5% everyday, buy ENPH 👍; Tbh i kinda find it disgusting that tesla is only going up this much bc it’s expected for elon to get the government to essentially rig the game for them. 

Ah well it is what it is, congrats to all the people making money.; There’s a great deal of chasing going on right now. I’m staying away from it. There are some companies that are okay value but most of this is euphoria at this point

I’m not selling anything, but I am Building a cash position through saving; Why do I waste my time diversifying internationally? America is insane, they just keep winning somehow.; Still think of the best things I read from this sub was a few years ago when someone was talking about how HVAC stocks are some of the best investments, just due to global warming. 

It's pretty insane how well you could be doing just by owning some names in the space, like the 1Y return is pretty incredible: 

TT - 83%

LMB -  217%

CARR - 51%

AAON - 123%

FIX - 142%

MOD - 200%

Crazy thing is that with data centers, these business are still seeing a ton of growth. Like AAON report the other day:  


>Net sales rose by 10.4% year-over-year to $313.6 million, gross profit increased by 20.3% to $113.1 million, and diluted earnings per share grew by 12.7% year-over-year to $0.62. Furthermore, the company's backlog reached a record $650 million, marking a 23.5% increase year-over-year.

>In addition to these financial highlights, AAON has secured orders worth approximately $174.5 million from a data center customer, further cementing its position in the data center cooling market.; We have reached 6000. I repeat, we have reached 6000.🚀; Treasury pays 4% a year, SPY pays 5% a week.; Sold BTC at $69k.

Sold UPST on a bounce to break even on stock I've been down bad on since acquiring due to CSP's I had sold.

Sold my ARK shit last week to offset BTC gains and I'm tired of looking at red.

Used proceeds from UPST sale to open position in RIVN and lower cost basis on ENPH.

Without the free ride i.e. Chinese luxury growth, all the luxury brands now have to actually win customers. Consumers are not buying into the large price hikes, no innovation and lower quality of their goods. This is not good for EU market as the home of luxury goods companies (France, Italy, Switzerland); Anybody watching SEZL? Shits insane; It's so wild, up like 16% this month. Crazy how just holding and doing nothing really is a great way to invest.; Presuming the likely consolidation for a couple of weeks doesn't bring the S&P down by much, the 2013 record on gains really is at risk of going down.

You know the reasons.; Why is vital farms dumping?; $SQ with the huge drop, I feel like sentiment is at a low point for it's services. For me, someone who believes in it long term, I picked up a small amount more. It's growth isn't quite at projections (barely off I feel like)  but Bitcoin surges help SQ immensely, and cashapp is a product I use everyday and has done well for me. Finnancial companies are set to see growth almost across the board, while fintech is slightly different I see deregulation (or whatever trump ends up doing)as a positive for them; Even weirder is that some the states don't even do daylight savings, like Arizona. Really hope we get rid of it in the future.; all green energy down since Trump has opposite idea ya know? invest in guns and ammo; Well US is an oligarchy so its to be expected; That's how I feel. I'm happy with what I own and glad I bought the last few years. However, I'm in no rush and will wait for things to open up. There will always be new opportunities. 

I just hate that it's boring now. Like I actually enjoy researching and finding new companies and just really nothing new is showing up in my screeners.; Thing can’t have the most basic pullback. No profit taking to be had. It just goes up and up and up and up ; Same. I'm being very cautious. Trimmed my portfolio a little bit before the tech crash yesterday and took some profits. I'm planning to DCA slowly over the next 6-12 months because I'm worried of instability.; Just buy US big tech forever, infinite money glitch; I think about that too. I've held ex-US for like a decade now and it has barely gone anywhere.; There have been a bunch of reports lately about US equities under performing international over the next decade; yep. Better gradually learn to all in . MSTR APP SEZL; HVAC and grid/power solution companies should be goated because of climate change and AI ramp up (we are cooking this planet but at least we will make money out of it). 

My only doubt would be that Trump is going to follow the market directions, which means MAG7 directions, so M&A and near monopolies may squeeze out the small and up-and-coming companies.; what should i look for when analyzing an HVAC company to invest in?; Chill, vegeta; Absolutely insane. I'm a bull and even I'm worried for this bubble at this point.; recently goldman or jpmorgan was just saying SPY would have single digit yearly gains going forward.; thank , just pick up UPST today!; I think we should let C grade winners run, and cut back on A grade. I'm talking UPST and ABNB respectively; Ive said this before but if the market ever lets me get a run at special purpose acquisition trading again I think I could retire early. I did like +400% in one year knowing almost nothing but got a feel for it pretty fast, with the amount of knowledge I gained from then till now it would be like shooting fish in a barrel; Where would the household liquidity that powered that bubble come from?; Pltr and tsla and arm are all meme bubbles; mstr coin hood the trio; Idk about special purpose acquisition companies being included, but there's a very real alternate world from what I think could happen (something that's 2018 esque) where basically everything that's 2020 themed runs like crazy for at least a year and a half.; It’s been a big topic (and probably a large driver in RTO) for a while now, based on that report it seems like the next 3 years or so are going to be the most vulnerable time for the overall economy. I guess everyone is counting on asset inflation outpacing interest rates to keep the extend and pretend party going.; If you don't mind me asking, what do you for a living? You know so much about business and markets, it's really cool!; Costar has commentary on the real estate market in all their calls, and is worth checking out even if you don't own the company.

They see CRE bottoming and activity picking up soon.; for the next 4 year's; Yep; I don't own it but the obliteration of ENPH is impressive. I'm almost considering buying some just from a technically oversold perspective.; in the short term, maybe; Just insane. I want to short it since it's massively overvalued, but this market is delusional right now; I panic sold in the summer, sad to see that was right; We had dips last april and last summer. It will dip eventualy. Just buy more when it does!; I guess even if Trump tries to crash the market with his ignorant shit there's still ZIRP to bail him out...; This is more a seasonal pattern than euphoria. Costco always moves higher between November 2nd and November 19th. This is when institutions and pension funds start cycling it into their holdings.; Not PLTR being up 45% in a week after showing 30% Rev growth YoY and now having almost 45 PS ratio lmaooo; it's looking more and more like what Goldman Sachs said is true...  

money managers are chasing end of year performance. Their jobs are on the line.

they are indiscriminately buying all the dogshit; The only fundamental you need is vibes; That's a wild ride.; this must be the top. The more I wait, the more I have to pay. damnit; yessir!!; sure fucking seems like it.

i have high suspicion of a new years rug pull. 

This stinks of the 2021 ponzi; What 2013 record are you referring to?; plenty of room for more players in the robotaxi industry.

What happened?; Mag 7 is the answer for majority of the questions on sub.  For non Mag 7 stocks that dont get brought up as much PE firms such as KKR, APO, OWL, and BX. 

Also JPM, GS, and MS since there will likely be more mergers and acquisitions and they are the picks and shovels of that were you benefit no matter which company gets bought out.; Defense is a good shout as always every time there is a republican trifecta.

Schedule F being enacted and govt jobs going to contractors will be a huge boon to the MIC.; I wonder if EDR would see anything, since Dana White has close connections with the new admin.; My porftolio has dropped 2% since trump was declared the winner - I have international exposure and healthcare exposure. the drop was enough to outweigh the increases in my other stocks.; Well I know there was some China news around TSM is stopping some advanced chip production. Also wonder if it could be related to the all the Tarif talks?; International and better-valued stocks are getting killed while meme and overvalued stocks are mooning. It actually makes total sense; Considering the uber leftist (not in the superficial woke leftist US sense) woman who is Mexico’s president…I have my doubts Trump will do much that benefits Mexico.; I know some people have brought up PAC before. I'm also curious, haven't really found any direct Mexico companies, but I've done well with onshoring in the states plays with FLEX and JBL.; [deleted]; Sold when I was up 130% and somehow still regret it. Actually think you might've flagged it right at the start based on some twitter DD which led to me buying.; the time to invest is before earnings....; I think it has the potential to reach $350 from here based on technicals. I'd put a stop loss at $272, and if it breaks $321 I'd move the stop up to $301.; For a long term hold, should be solid, but not sure what Trump will mean for semis as well. One thing to call out, is that not all semi's are the same. A lot of equipment makers as well companies that deal with auto/industrials have seen declining sales for like the past year or so.

That's what would make actually bullish, is that the market will bottom sometime in the future for the weaker sectors.; Yea. PE firms often give you great tips on what to invest in. Blackstone/BX was pounding the table on data centers and even bought out a publicly traded data center REIT in June 2021.

If one took the risk and bought IRM in 2021-2022. You would be up over 100% on your shares.; Seems like most growth names are running, I'm not reading to much into specifics for most things.; maybe when they get 100 PS they will slow down.; Same for IONQ; Negative momentum sine July. I'd forget about it for a while, there are so many other opportunities in this raging bull market.; Might be stagnant but im jumping in at these levels. Im not chasing those raging bulls.; Puts reminds me of a certain cosmic being.; yep been here since 2020; I think next year I'm going to take the plunge and start looking into options. I never messed with derivatives, but really feels like a place where you can make a ton of money.; feels like we shouldn't underestimate the fomo.

some goldman sacks insider just said money managers around the world are underperforming and chasing this shit.

if they don't chase, they get fired after xmas.; It's kind of wild there is like 14M shares on the float.; based on history, within 6 months.

have fun waiting.; All auto semi stocks this year are proof of that ; Redditors will never learn, theyve shilled Intel, Disney, Paypal and now Google, listening to reddit is like burning money in a chimney.; What's that mean?; Sounds more like a coincidence than anything; so go all in; A lot of ANET’s gains have been pulled forward. It’s a great company obviously but I’m just not sure it will provide massive returns the next couple years

Not sure about NET; Yea. Surprised they didnt get an earnings thread on here given that it took place in AH yesterday. So there could have been a discussion if that -17% drop was justified. Like happens with other stocks when they report earnings.

Guess the market gave the answer that a -17% drop was overreaction.; I'm looking through the 10-Q filing and I think the selling is overblown.; $STRL was down like 12% when the market opened yesterday, clawed back up, and now is up 8% today. Not as crazy of a swing, but still wild to see how people/algo are acting on some of these reports.; The initial reporting had them missing EPS so the algos sold it off. Once other reporting came out that they beat on EPS it made their earnings look a bit better than what came out at first.; yup, get out when the stock is at a new 4 year low. 

then buy back in when the company recovers in a year since they arguably sell great products.; buy high, sell low; Most Toyota cars sold in USA are manufactured in USA so I would think tariffs would have little affect.; PS5 brought to you by Donald J. Trump; 599.63

SP500 did cross 6k though; You should be careful around tanker stocks right now. The whole sector is in a severe downturn sentiment-wise, and it will take a while to find the bottom. I'm very bullish on them as a long-term play but the thesis should only start bearing fruit in 2026.; stonk only goes up. They just miss out; You do you, but I would never listen to anything off StockTwits.; LMAP 58 PE for costco.

Cost, TSLA, ARM, PLTR all having a funny competition on who can be the most overvalued stock; The stock market isn't rational.; Yes we go up forever. Have an occasion down day or 2, but that just leads to a very fast V. So basically a forever bull market. ; no, we continue to pump even if earnings arent great.

earnings dont matter. valuations dont matter. nothing matters other than green green green every day until the heat death of the universe; Them superpowers getting neutralized, I can only watch in silence🗣; Load up on it under 200$ tbh, I have been getting some shares between 140-175.; Cheapest mag 7 stock with insane fundamentals, under 200 its bargain; Should soon; Bullshit company, Tesla is way better.; google really have a lot of love in reddit. So, legend say you should inverse reddit. Google is a stagnant business .; I bought $PYPL because I thought it was just ridiculously mispriced (probably because lots of retail dumped it because they got burned). DCF implied something zero to slightly negative fcf growth. Thought buybacks and new management could do quite well for the stock but now it seems like a lot of that has gotten priced in.

If I had more confidence in their moat this could be a longer time hold but I need to do more DD for that. Paytech seems to be really competitive with Adyen, SQ and a bunch of other players eating up some market share.; If you care about TA: looks like volume is nothing special so it's just running with the rest of the market. I think it may face strong resistance at 83.7 and then around $87.7-$89, if it breaks that just let it keep running.; I bought pretty close to the bottom and wasn’t really planning to hold this long, I thought the rebound to this sort of level or higher would be much quicker. Might hold out a couple more months but planning to sell fairly soon.; Hard to know what wallstreet is even pricing in nowadays; What's driving its growth?; Worries about Apple ending their relationship and them losing their Arm license overshadow good earnings I assume; Didn’t the stock gain like 8% off the earnings? People taking profit from a move like that isn’t t that crazy. ; They had quite a run, but I've posted about them here for months. They were super cheap, but great company. The big thing for me that I was sold on was the fact they have higher enrollment now than compared to covid. 

Plus there is kind of the culture wars around education in the US.; No idea, only thing that stands out to me, is the stock is still crazy expensive, even for a SaSS company. Also the guidance isn't good enough for how expensive they are: 

[https://www.barrons.com/articles/datadog-earnings-stock-price-45a50907](https://www.barrons.com/articles/datadog-earnings-stock-price-45a50907)

>That’s partly because the market is forward looking and the company’s forecast was nothing to write home about. DDOG said it expects revenue between $709 million and $713 million for the fourth quarter. The mid-point of this range at $711 million is below the $712 million priced in by Wall Street.; Same as NET, p/s and expectations so high that even with decent news its not enough; Has been since IPO; I have. 

Not sure of all cases, since I have some stocks that are from my employee stock program, since there is double tax, but I usually tax harvest my DSUs. 

However, stock has been on tear, so no longer really have any shares at a loss.; Depends on pricing power. If it's something consumers gotta buy then great for stock. If there's alternatives and people flee the product then bad for stock.; Other factor not mentioned is if cost of production also go up. If costs go up and company raises price in response, margin is the same. Ideally you want to see cost stay the same or fall and price rise. Example: oil company gets better at drilling so their cost of production falls but the price of oil globally rises so they can charge more.; Yes, rebuying doesn't matter for gains it only matters for losses... If you ever sell with gains those gains are now taxed and if you rebuy the cost basis is the price. It's only when realizing losses that cost basis will get adjusted by rebuying within the set period ; Because redditors shill that pos company.; Google has a woke buttermilk culture and unwilling to take risks. See how msft had to be the one to start the ai craze when google been sitting on it for a decade. Also lots of projects they just sorta let die.; The market has been making new highs for 232 years.  One could have asked if it was too high for all of these years and been wrong; Nobody can see the future.; An option is to get in partially like $5k rather than lump sum.; No. Africans can't be president. Are schools no longer teaching the constitution? Same with Arnold that people here on reddit kept claiming would be the next president after he became ruler of CA. He can't because he is European which also isn't allowed.; the actor?!; Any time someone attempts to predict the market ask does this man or woman have a record of being correct and billions of dollars in profits from tradig?; One thing you can do is just find a company you like and see how has the biggest holdings. Like GEO is a private prison, just look up which ETF owns the most: 

[https://www.etf.com/stock/GEO](https://www.etf.com/stock/GEO)

I doubt there will be a prison one specifically, but just keep in mind, when dealing with thematic ETFs, you usually have higher expense ratios.; [Bureau of Prisons (BOP) Awarded Contracts | Federal Compass](https://www.federalcompass.com/federal-government-awarded-contracts/by-gov/Bureau-of-Prisons-(BOP)); It's called SPY; BA BA black sheep; A few of us discussed this a few days ago and said that we expect a rally after the election regardless of who wins. There seemed to be general agreement, a few upvotes, not much arguing the contrary.; Musk is still saying it is going to crash. Look at the posts here on reddit giving him credit for being right.; Also the democrats lost because they didn’t push the Palestine and Trans issues more according to what I have been reading here. Inverse Reddit to make money. After all, this is the birthplace of r/antiwork and limp wrists.; trying and suceeding.

clown market. TSLA at 320 is too fucking hilarious; Both. Twitter/X is very pro-Trump so there's bias. Trump is probably gonna be easier when it comes to regulation and overall business practices which companies like. So for the stock market, it might turn out alright.; A lot of people on Twitter are literally Nazis; No, just look at an sp500 chart and it basically goes up and to the right over the long term no matter who the president is. Don't let fear drive your investments.; It's nonzero that we replay 2018 to an extent, but I don't think it'd be worth it to sell out entirely due to that.


I actually think there's another path where this gets completely absurd and all the stuff from 2020 wakes up and runs like crazy, then Trump holds the bag of the start of the next secular bear market.; MSNBC claiming there’s going to be an insurrection on Jan 6 and fear mongering is ridiculous. Don’t fall for that. ; Because no clever arrangement of bad eggs ever made a good omelet.; haven't touch them since 3 months ago. But might be because of they have to spend money to build factory or something. Mr. Market doesn't see any potential grow in it. 

Vitl is in heavy competitive market. customer can buy eggs from local farmer at dirt cheap with comparable quality .; Huge .92% drop?; Oh the entire US doesn’t do that? That’s interesting.; Or invest in LNG assets.; Funny enough, one of my midcap defense names is up pretty big lol. It’s like 20% the last few days. ; I like the boring. There are more tickers being discussed now than there ever was doing the bear market in 2022.  When the bear market actually happens and stocks are down 20-50% off high this sub becomes hostile about it. Or they become silent about what they are buying. At least now I can collect tickers to put on a watchlist for the next dip.; Agreed. It’s truly just about watching the current companies I own and seeing the gains for now. Not interested in going fishing for anything overpriced; Sounds like a meme but you are correct; but but isn't tech stock always expensive, overpriced for the past 30 years. The bubble can pop any moment, there's always the 2000 2008 risk. I don't wanna buy high and sell higher.; The Trump era will most likely be good for small caps. The Biden era was terrible due to disproportionate regulatory impacts for companies that weren't billion-dollar empires.; That I have no idea about. Personally, I still think it's going to be a lot of tailwinds, just due the those factors. I feel like I've been rewarded as an investor from owning these names the last few years. 

Also started talking about buying companies that deal with Naval and Military Components, like CW and DRS.; I'm a big believer of just using fundamentals. A lot of these names has seen a wild run. However, a company like FIX has been growing pretty rapidly. 

[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FIX&p=d](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FIX&p=d)

While the stock has gone up a ton, the underlining business has gone up with the price. It's still a foward PE of 27, PEG of 1.37, PS 2.4. 

Company has an high ROI of 25% and here their last earnings:

>net income was $146.2 million, or $4.09 per diluted share, as compared to $105.1 million, or $2.93 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $1.81 billion compared to $1.38 billion in 2023. The Company reported operating cash flow of $302.2 million in the current quarter compared to $214.2 million in 2023.

>Brian Lane, Comfort Systems USA’s President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “We are happy to report record earnings and cash flow this quarter, as our employees continue to achieve unmatched execution for our customers. Recently acquired companies exceeded our high expectations, and each of our operating segments excelled in every respect. Quarterly per share earnings were 40% ahead of the same quarter last year, and through nine months our per share earnings were 60% higher than in the same period last year. Cash flow surpassed any previous quarter, and that extraordinary cash flow is both a great base for continued investment and a definite signal of strong underlying trends in our execution, customer relationships, and prospects.”

>Backlog as of September 30, 2024 was $5.68 billion as compared to $5.77 billion as of June 30, 2024 and $4.29 billion as of September 30, 2023. On a same-store basis, backlog increased from $4.29 billion as of September 30, 2023 to $5.17 billion as of September 30, 2024.

I've had the same theory around investing here for years, which is physical data center, HVAC, electrification, companies that have tailwinds with IRA/Infrastructure bill. A lot of these have overlap as well.; Goldman Sachs and Vanguard.; What's special about SPAC trading?; Any dumb fad that starts we should be quick to jump in and leave; Dunno.  Money markets?  Aren't there trillions still there?  Also like 68 trillion in wealth transfer from boomers to millenials over the coming decade.

I'm going by vibes here though.; I mean we’re gonna see more ipos, mergers, and acquisitions.  Plus less regulation - at least in the crypto space. On top of trump pinning his presidential success partly on stocks go up.; I'm a buyside analyst and portfolio manager.; Which subsector? CRE is a broad brush, and some of them are artificially depressed by fear connected to office space.; I'm down 50% fuck; Don't. The technical momentum is massive. It has the potential to get near $400 next year if it breaks through the resistances at $314.5 (did just now), $318.7, $364, $384; Rule #1: Never short TSLA; [deleted]; The what?; Especially as the tariffs and deportations are looking more and more likely, we're in for some ""hardship"".; It does cost a lot (iirc 200k), but it should get cheaper over time (esp if they continue partnerships with car manufacturers. Right now they only have hyundai). 

&nbsp;

But since they're running 150k-200k rides per week, they're still growing pretty quickly. Who's the 2nd automated driving service after waymo? and how many rides do they run per week?; Thank you Redditor, very cool; I'll wait until the earnings report after the EV tax credits are removed; Let me know when those ceos are part of the administration whispering in the presidents ear; Was Bill Gates going to be in her administration?; I don't own Google?; Ferguson, baby.; Yep, looks like those earnings left investors a bit scrambled :)  They are facing headwinds with rising expenses but the drop seems to be an over-reaction. Curious if anyone spotted anything specific that may stand out?; Beginning from last year the company has pivoted to the Power Systems segment of its clientele (data centers, utilities, etc.), which has incredibly high margins and demand. I got in at $9 after seeing the YoY increase in gross margins and their dedication towards manufacturing custom enclosures for the data center space.; Only thing I can think of is maybe mergers. I dont see how the new admin could help WWE and UFC grow revenue. Which would again favor the picks and shovels play I mentioned of JPM, GS, and MS.; Mine is up. Most of what I have is in VTI, but I also hold VEA which has gotten killed. AAPL, META, AMZN, MSFT, and NVDA have all had one good day and two down days.; I hold VEA which is developed markets, but I guess the tariffs aren't just for China. I don't really know.; Tariffs and a lunatic who has shrugged whenever asked if the US will protect Taiwan.  He loves a dictator so lotsa folk worrying China finally gets its wish.  And Putin.; An additional potential tailwind for Mexican airports is the increased traffic if Republicans follow through with their plans to ramp up deportations. Most deportations happen by air and these are paid for by the US government - I believe Trump has said 'no price is too high' for the cost of mass deportations.

Not sure exactly who would stand to benefit though or even if it's a good thesis with any substantial benefit or if its a dumb idea, need to do more research but just something I was thinking about. I already hold some PAC as a reshoring play anyway; Not sure how that changes companies moving into Mexico for manufacturing. I mean a ton of companies have been moving manufacturing there for a while. 

It's also the largest US trading partner:

I suppose it depends on how tough on China Trump wants to be really; [deleted]; [I agree, the time to invest was many earnings ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/183gyxf/rstocks_weekend_discussion_saturday_nov_25_2023/kar6t01/). Most of my position is sold so I'm not really benefiting much from today's price action anyway.; I've basically sold out entirely and just have a lingering position. 4 shares out of original 14. Could have sold much higher than when I did (between $160 and $240) but relative to my cost basis ($110s) I was happy with it.; That’s a good shout I didn’t think about the auto side and what not, I still do some research but might allocate less of my monthly investment until I feel abit more confident; OWL's more invested in private credit these days. But they're very conservative and only work with investment-grade companies with stellar credit quality. Retail investors were acting like they didn't dissect UPST's risk profile and the whole agreement was a big error in judgment.; same for sezl; What do they do?; I've lost track at this point.; No, definitely not. Cosmic is too bullish certain commodities. Puts' alts were around like 2-3 weeks ago but actually recently have disappeared. (I'm usually able to identify instantly); It's so funny think we've like all interacted with each other for years; or lose a ton a money; The profit factor for derivatives can be mind-blowing if you have a proper strategy. It's a whole different ballgame though that requires a different skillset than traditional investing. Fundamentals are irrelevant.; I'm not talking about how high the market will go in the future, only the technical exposure in the SPY for today that limits how far it can reasonably move. The options distribution shifts every trading day.; Average volume: 72k

You get a lot of long term holders with that mindset though. Still the most interesting company, in terms of verticals. Plumbing and hospice care. Which is basically the result of management being opportunistic above all else.; Which in theory is the time we should be buying, if looking longer term.  

Really wild just kind of waiting around but I think I’m going to start moving some capital to work in the space next year. ; TSMC reports revenues monthly per Taiwan law, and the number reached 3xx,xxxM Taiwan dollars for the first time, earlier than I expected.


https://investor.tsmc.com/english/monthly-revenue/2024; Pretty much; Yea that's fair I think. Not sure what to so with my own tbh, valuation makes me concerned but selling great companies on valaution alone usually bites me; Interesting I have to dig deeper. I saw the lowered guidance and it spooked me a bit but haven’t sold; Not sure which companies are there, but isn't there a ton of car makers in Mexico as well?; Don’t know much about the industry but want to learn more. Glad I have a year or so to learn judging by your post lol; For reals, I don't get it. I bought at 400 so I am set basically, an incredibly great move I didn't plan, I just love the store; In theory, aren't you just explaining Buffet's idea of never bet against America? 

Even on top of that, there will be down years in the market, but usually the it takes some black swan that brings about a recession to really kill the market.; Or until our monetary and fiscal policies catch up to us; Then everyone just needs to go long and World poverty is going to be resolved. 
Easy.; The famous stocks we once knew is looking paranoid and now is spiraling 📉; Ngl I'm not a TA guy whatsoever and probably never will be, but appreciate the comment anyway; i can't share the screenshot. You could check out ""sezl eps"" it list its financial for the last 4 quarter. EPS through the roof.

I'm ready for a dip, through. This is insane. Insane than APP yesterday; There’s double tax on DSUs? I assume yes just like RSUs charge an RSU tax and then capital gains if you sell. Im not entirely sure if Im planning to sell my RSU shares yet but I have other losses in personal accounts; I see. So it all depends on whether the company is offering something that's needed for people's daily lives vs. something that they can live without getting said product.

This does not bode well for the techonology sector... Anyway, I appreciate the response!; Ah yes. I had a feeling margin should fall into play somewhere and there it is. Thank you so much!; thanks. i was hoping there was sort of a reverse-wash-rule thing in effect. guess i'll keep holding my PLTR 😁; elon musk, the actor!; Lol it’s Josh Brown. Pretty mixed success rate I would say 😂; Elon musk could eat a literal shit sandwhich and say it tasted better than wagyu and his brain dead cult would start catching their shit and eating it.

Half of that is Warren Buffet's; Makes total sense. It's nice having you here and ty for all your nuggets. I'm such an amateur  with all this stuff, but just love researching companies and what not.; Fanciest term for pyjama trader I've ever heard!; Very true. Here's their exact commentary:

""Finally, I want to touch on the economy and what we're seeing in the real estate economy. The commercial real estate economy has started to show signs of potential improvement from what I think is probably a cycle bottom. Office prices are down 18% over the past year and currently sit 43% below their peak level. It'd be a little worse if we were doing that in real dollars. Multifamily prices are down 11% over the past year and are 25% off from their peak. Industrial and retail prices never saw as big a decline and are down only 5% from their peaks.
The multifamily sector continued its recent trend of better-than-expected renter demand with 174,000 units being absorbed. This puts absorption for the year on pace to be double last year's levels and to be near the record levels last seen in 2021.
But with the wave of new construction that the sector has seen, strong absorption was not enough to match deliveries and vacancies remained at elevated levels currently at 7.9% and would increase a bit. With 720,000 units still under construction, those vacancy rates, I think, will remain at upper levels for quite some time. The office sector hit an all-time high in vacancy this quarter, but I'm becoming somewhat optimistic that we're about to see a turn.
The rate of increase in vacancy is slowing to a crawl. One important lead indicator, sublet vacancy, is now clearly falling. Another leading indicator, total availability is already falling. The spread between vacancy and availability is shrinking usually indication of early signs of recovery.
Leasing volume is back to pre-pandemic levels, though with smaller average lease size, suggesting a larger number of overall leases being signed. New construction underway at 82 million square feet is the lowest level seen since 2013 and not far from the lowest levels ever seen. These low levels will eventually translate into shrinking vacancies and rising rates, rents, back up the truck and load up on quality distressed office buildings on 10x.""

I did see all of Toyota, Honda, and Nissan reported weak earnings due in part to weakness in China. 

 Deere & Co was in the headlines recently w/ Trump for moving some manufacuring to Mexico. There is an argument to be made that Mexico might pick up some of China's manufacturing due to cost & deglobalization.; They are closely aligned with the commodities sphere and engage in similar harmonious cycles with whatever they're transporting.

Our plan takes the low price on the purchase date between this year and last year. Then we get a 15% discount off that price.

Also, I use a CPA who helps out with this stuff. I found an awesome local one on nextdoor app and always suggest talking to a professional with this type of stuff.; What double tax you are referring to?

0 to ""Vest Value"" is added in your income and taxed accordingly.

""Vest Value"" to ""Sell Price"" is capital gain/loss.

I hope you aren't taking cost basis for capital gain as 0, based on your double tax comment.

And yes, you can offset your capital gain/loss on RSUs against other capital loss/gain.; Nope, the government wants you to pay tax basically ASAP lol; > Have an actual physics degree and following whats happening in the physics world today, then seeing Elon talk about colonizing mars makes my head want to explode with how dumb he sounds

Did they give more specific information about that?; Curious if the commentary discusses how valuations of those buildings can be salvaged by the time the maturity wall begins hitting in mid-2025. As much of a bargain the prime areas of real estate are going to be, the loans will assuredly be underwater by the time deal-making is underway. Those millstones will drag the institutional lenders, who were relying on the buildings' mark-to-market values as collateral, down with them.; Issue is, it took waymo a bunch of years to get to this point.

I actually view it as a hobby, so I have fun looking into companies and fundamentals and just learning. 

It's cool, because investing as hobby can be low cost, just depending on what you want to actually mess around with capital wise, but you can make money. Like for fun, I created another account to see how far I take 500 bucks and I'm already up to 650 in like two weeks. It's nothing crazy, but basically just made enough for a nice dinner doing nothing really. 

I think being inquisitive is what makes some of the best investors and it's part of why people like Buffet/Munger (RIP) read so much. They are just really inquisitive people. 

Even though I'm a software engineer, I studied sociology and I think just one my nature abilities is to see macro trends. I also just listen to podcasts and informative videos all day when working.

CMBS delinquency rates remain elevated and office delinquencies have increased notably to 7.7%.

As a result, I believe you will see more transactions on 10x in the year ahead.""; yes the problem with waymo is its part of google and doesnt move the stock really, no way to directly invest in it; If you're in on it; Buy calls then.; What do you estimate the fair value of the stock then?; Makes sense. Yeah, it's one of the industrial sectors that I just never got too into since I was more focused on like grid rather than plumbing. Still love when low volume names with low floats buy back a ton of stock. 

To me, that is usually a marker of a great company.; LMAO what a non sequitor i love it; Look at him; From my experience, most retail investors fall into two categories: 

* They treat the stock market as a casino that requires taking huge risk. They endlessly take moonshots hoping to strike it rich instead of accumulating wealth over time. If you treat it like a casino, it will treat you like a sucker at the card table. 
* They assume the stock market is a bank account on steroids and they are owed gains whenever they buy what is trending. Due diligence is a foreign phrase - after all, hasn't the market already chosen winners and losers by democratic vote? If it's not in the Nasdaq 100 or S&P, it doesn't exist. But these investors only do well when the overall market does well. 

It's really neither. At heart investing is a philosophy of pattern recognition and risk management.

> **Even though I'm a software engineer**, I studied sociology and I think just one my nature abilities is to see macro trends.

That gives you a great advantage.

The market is an emergent system made up of different parts continuously interacting over time.

No job is perfect.; Yeah. I go back to the idea that one thing that is cool about investing, is you can define what you think is a good company. Like some of the best investments I've made have been exactly what you described. Average volume on like IESC is 126,537.; It sucks because 99% of the time, there's no good reason behind it.

Lucky for my dad, he deals with mainly like LPL and bankers, so nothing too crazy with dealing with clients. 

Yeah, I feel like having to have soft skills and communication to deal with clients, especially when they are that needy.; Totally, I think you introduced to the concept of fly over names basically. Hope you've been doing well btw!"
"What's the take on AAPL's future given Trump victory, Tariffs and Elon gaining more power","What do you think will happen to AAPL?  
I have a high exposure to AAPL and it has served me well. With Apple Intelligence and general trend in tech stocks with AI boost, I still saw some upside and was thinking of holding for longer. But now what Trump won and tariffs are coming, I see Apple products becoming more expensive and taking a hit in sales in the US. 

Also, I feel Elon has had a tiff with Apple in the past with them pulling ads from Twitter/X, Elon trying to launch Tesla Phone and some history with Apple refusing to buy Tesla since Elon had put some shitty condition like he wants to be CEO of Apple as part of the deal.

Do you think Apple will likely see more downside with this Administration or will it likely be more or less the same fate as rest of the Tech stocks? Is Trump Victory ultimately agnostic to Apple's future?",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gm1yta/whats_the_take_on_aapls_future_given_trump/,59,"We do not produce any phones in the US. 

Just means everyone will have to buy less phones, because everything will be more expensive.; Realistically, I think any large company will simply get exceptions to tariffs via lobbying.

The real concern for me, especially in regards to Apple and really other tech companies is the possible fate of TSMC. Trump is an isolationist at heart and has not committed to defending Taiwan. Personally, I don't think he will when it comes down to it. In any case, an invasion of Taiwan during the next few years would be absolutely catastrophic to the semiconductor industry. Just food for thought.; AAPL will probably go up unless it doesn’t, in that case it more than likely would go down

Edit: That is of course unless it goes sideways instead; I'm in a similar position and really have not thought about the tariffs situation.  I've been holding up for 12 years. Like another post,  expect chaos.  

Maybe Tim Apple will bow and kiss the ring.; Tim Apple?

Tariffs could harm apple products, making things so much more expensive, on top of things ALREADY getting more expensive, so people will neglect buying upgraded iPhones because they need to buy food. 

I trimmed my position.; I spent the last day or so trying to figure out Trump’s position on EVs, and just came across a bunch of articles regarding Elon. 

Elon has 19 different lawsuits across all of his companies. He regularly interacts with the federal government regarding OSHA, vehicle safety, rocket launches, and recently online communication. He has a ton of government contracts. You can sums up his relationship with the government as “it’s complicated.”

He will likely push and pull regulations in a bunch of different ways, on top of the tariffs. A magic orb might give you better clarity than what anyone online can tell you right now. 

Honestly, the only safe choice right now might be index funds - individual stocks may rise and fall so quickly that getting the average result is preferable in times of uncertainty.; Apple moved some of their production out of China and in Trump's first term he excluded apple from tariffs. 

There isn't going to be a Tesla phone, no Tesla bull believes there will be one at least.

I don't own any Aapl as I don't buy apple products. But I don't see anything that would affect the stock negatively.; Apple still has a 'moat'  because apple users aren't focused on price that much.  They aren't going to android or windows, because it costs 20% more.

At least that's been true for last 20 years.    You don't buy apple to save a dollar.  

maybe they won't be as profitable.  or they onshore some production.

TBH, Mexico should benefit the most from a trade war.; Personally I think elons little ""power boost"" is only temporary, man's still dealing with alot of legal bs and the disaster of the cybertruck is gonna cause tesla to TANK the coming year. Plus theirs the recent stories of him  being here illegally and the stories of his illegal drug use. Trump/Republicans will only be able to protect him for so long before elons little empire falls apart; Expect chaos.; They will keep making money; It's gonna go up when you sell and go down when you buy OP!; Elon has directly stated on Joe Rogan last week that they are not discussing launching a phone and have not discussed it previously with the team at Tesla.; If it comes from or made in  China....sell.....US imports in 2023 were close to 1/2 Trillion $$

A 10% or 20% tarrif would be nuts....if just in China....

Trump was taking 10% across the board 

US imports 2023 were 3.2 Trillion 

Would cause huge inflation across the board .....trigger a recession.....

Stupid, Stupid, Stupid....but then...look who said/wants to do it....; Tariff will probably have all sorts of exceptions, Trump is a transactional dude.; If Apple survived Trump’s first term, why they won’t in his second term; On Joe Rogan, Elon said he had no plan to make phones unless Google and Apple started bullying consumers; Anything that hurts Apple will also hurt elons companies. Elon may actually be a great person to be on the inside. As a true billionaire, trump idolizes him.; Worth pointing out something like a quarter of Apple's revenue now comes from services, not hardware. They've been relying on growth in services revenue to cover for declining hardware sales for years, now - people are keeping their phones and computers for longer. 

Obviously trying to predict what sorts of petty fights Trump will get into, and the kind of damage they could cause, is extremely difficult. But if tariffs gut hardware sales, yeah, Apple will take a hit, like every other hardware company. But Apple's business is diversified enough to ride things out.

I would be shocked if they're not using some of that massive pile of cash to stockpile things, as well. Obviously, that's only a short-term solution, but I'm willing to bet they are going to have way more of those just-announced laptops and Mac minis delivered to their warehouses in America than they normally would.; I think iPhones are about to be $3,000 each if they have to make them in America; Everyone is expecting the tariffs to actually be a thing and I personally think it was just red meat for the base.  Silicone valley will probably benefit tremendously from the de-regulation of the new administration.; Every big company has been red teaming this since the last election, it’s not going to catch anyone by surprise or unprepared. The new reality is government meddling and having to buy off politicians to avoid interference, just like Russia and other quasi-third world countries. It is what it is - free markets and capitalism are out under Trump.; Even if Apple doesn’t grow they’re still printing like $140B in profit each year. Stock buy backs alone will prop the stock up. Any growth is additive to stock appreciation. They’re in a lull at the moment but at some point AI features will be good and fuel an upgrade cycle. They have so much optionality on revenue opps and M&A is now in play.

Cook and Trump also have a great relationship so I’m not too worried about macro risk.; AAPL is one company that you hold forever; I am no expert but all I can say is that Apple is setting itself up to be the next INTC. Insane price tags for their systems. Imagine buying a PC/Laptop these days with 256GB of storage only? in my last 20 years of owning different PC's I have never ever had one with 256GB. Their phones are essentially the same as well. We can clearly see they have no innovation any more.  Unless they do something, I expect them to slowly dip.; Not election related,but Apple has been throwing caution to future sales.

https://m.slashdot.org/story/435099; AI just got a jolt. AAPL will do well; Tesla never tried to launch a phone.  Elon has said they’re not interested in it.  Tim and Elon made up since the scuffle over CEO position.  Last year Tim hosted Elon at Apple HQ; They have more cash than the US; I will buy a new phone soon. It should last 4 years. Or I can just pick up another while I vacation in Thailand.; I see upside to Apple.; I thought APPL was a bank.. is bet 70 billion dollars they can find more revenue; i trimmed my apple position a few days back at $233. it is a range bound this year.; I don’t think Trump will tariff every country and every product and service. I think he’ll target countries with asymmetric tariffs like China. Apple does manufacture in China, but they’ve been working hard to diversify internationally. As long as Trump doesn’t enact tariffs immediately and without warning, Apple should be able to rotate capacity without too many disruptions.; No one in here discusses the other side of the coin. The bigger problem of this stupid tariff is not the US side but the retaliatory tariffs that will be put on US exports to China. Last time, it destroyed US soybean industry, causing more bankruptcy than at any other time in history. What if it's not soybean but iPhone this time, not just tariffs but outright ban iPhone sales in China? I trade with China and, after the last 8 years of trade war, Chinese nationalism is at an all-time high. They are using more and more domestic products (cars, phones, everything). Their BYD is objectively better than Tesla for 1/3rd of the price and Huawei phones are ""3-5 years ahead of Samsung"". 

I don't see any of the rhetoric and trade war is going to help Apple sells more phones in China and/or find any other market to replace it. 

I'm not just selling APPL now, I have a huge Put position based on pure economic outlook. Tell me. If you hold Apple, where is the growth? Where do you make more bucks in this environment? Where are your customers? Right now all I see are downsides.; I think Trump will protect USA companies that aren’t on his black list.; Remember while you argue about tariffs, they are out planning something more nefarious…; Apple is going to be fine. Trump is good for business, not bad. We aren’t going to be tariffing Taiwanese or Vietnamese semiconductors which is their main risk - that would be crazy and Musk isn’t dumb. 

Main issue for Apple is we need AI to drive an upgrade cycle for them. Thus far, the new AI features aren’t cool enough to get everyone upgrading their iPhones. We may get those features next year, announced in June 2025. 

AAPL’s valuation is fine, EPS is growing 15% a year, so expect 15% annual stock returns from Apple until something gets better or worse for them. I think the next step is AI making things better in 2H25.; Don't forget its many american corporations that manufacturer good in china. Trump is not very sophisticated he just says shit to sees what stinks up the whole room .; It's bearish trend now.
Maybe it'll become bullish.
Simple.; it depends what he slaps tariffs on. it isn't a blanket tariff on all imports, or wasn't last time he was president. plus apple has been moving away from china to avoid this already. good chance he just moves completely away from china when this happens.; Now is a good time to unload your AAPL shares - great company but just WAY overvalued. It can't grow revenues fast enough to match that high PE ratio. With AAPL growth rate it should be trading at 12-15 PE.

Then on top of that you have the utter chaos of tRump, with even more power than before. Do you think China will just take a 60% tariff from the USA? No China will place an export Tariff of 60% on products like the Iphone...

Sell high, buy low...; It’ll be great, we’ll assemble phones in America and they’ll cost like, $5 more. People wildly over estimate the assembly costs of electronics. If we have to make all the components here that’ll be tough; Yep. Look at Brazil as an example of tariffs gone wild.; Everyone will go to Mexico to buy phones; Didn't apple build a huge iphone factory in america?; Apple will lose like 50% of its value in the next 4 years if tariffs hit hard.; Or they finally make cheaper phones because most of us don't need $1,000 phones anymore.


[Edit] My point was to lower production costs so they can absorb the tarrifs.; Even if tariffs did increase prices; your $78 monthly phone bill to pay off your new iPhone will now be $89. No one will bat an eye at this unless they’re paying cash for a phone. Yall are blowing this out of proportion

Edit: Make sure to sell off your Apple stock tomorrow morning after downvoting this;  Possible, but not always true. It could also just result in shifts. Phones could get more expensive while tariff income could offset a lower income tax. So in that example people wouldn't spend more. Other taxes would just fall to offset phone tariffs.; > Realistically, I think any large company will simply get exceptions to tariffs via lobbying.

Bingo. Everyone was kissing the ring this week, including Tim Apple.; Isn't that why Biden passed the chip act? Even though I think that Trump will repeal it...; Correct take on what I think will happen with tariffs. I think via exceptions, they are going to be fairly toothless on high value items and might actually become a forcing function to kick start US based manufacturing for smaller, daily items which will help decouple from China.

Dependence on Taiwan is still a major concern for all segments of tech incl Apple. If war breaks out, we'll have bigger things to worry about. 

Whether this works is another story all together but just more perspective over the constant gloom and doom paranoia.; Strongly believe this. One thing Trump won’t fuck with is corporations and their billionaire execs. Those are the people he cares about the most.

Single mother working 2 jobs? Suck on these tariffs.; the worry is that China will retailiate and add there own tariffs and no lobbying is going to help there - essentially and economic war and the consumer pays the price.; Won't Apple get hurt in sales in China? Isn't Tesla already hurting there?; > possible fate of TSMC. 

The fate of TSMC is they will become absorbed by the Chinese communist government.  But China will still ship their ICs (they're not giving up that money), so probably not much will change in that regard.   

Of course the people of Taiwan will be subjugated to cruel Chinese authoritarian rule, but that has nothing to do with investing.; [removed]; found the broker!; Could it go sideways?; This is the kind of deep market analysis I come to Reddit for 👌; I’d never take advice from someone who doesn’t know Apples ticker; He has. He congratulated Trump on his victory.; I’ve been holding for that long and I think my average is like $10 excluding All the dividends over the years .. not selling now lol; Maybe Apple will decide to book several hundred rooms at various Trump hotels.; That's how Trump addressed him in 2019ish.; >Elon has 19 different lawsuits across all of his companies. 

I have a feeling these might be going away sometime in mid January 2025; So when there are 500,000 starlink satellites in the sky and you get signal in every corner of the world you think there wont be a Elon musk cell phone? Its coming for sure.; Maybe so but I think even Apple users are realizing the annual upgrade simply isn't worth it.

You have no way of knowing that without knowing the tariff rates and the reduction in income tax. 

I explained to you one example of how tariffs can be offset. Not making a claim specifically as to what will happen here.... The discussion is not about  deficit spending and debt.

You agree that if we put a 1% tariff on imported cell phones and eliminate income tax, then people will have more money to spend on goods and services correct??; not nothing, some will be swayed to just not buy the stuff; How does your statement relate to my comment? I didn't say that they impact the selling country. That said, you are wrong. They can impact the selling country as the other commenter has explained. That's the whole point in many cases... You can ban imports from X country to negatively impact their economy. It's not always effective and not always good but it does have an impact. The impact could be as small as country X having to black market sales through an intermediary country. Or it can be as large as major economic issues; Well of course people would be less likely to buy Chinese made electronics if the price is marked up something fierce.  ; Actually not true. With the factories moving away many people become unemployed without decent social benefits and thus have no spending power. Coupling with our housing bubble crisis, everything is cheap but workers and businesses are bleeding. And people report not being paid or not being paid on time.; So let's say we eliminate income taxes and impose a 1% tariff on cell phone imports. Will the average person be able to buy more or less phones?; What do you think would happen  if we put a 1% tariff on imported cell phones and eliminate income taxes?; Agreed. I'm not claiming it's a good or quick idea, but it is something he has discussed if I remember correctly.

 I guess he could also attempt similar solutions like student debt relief. He could attempt something like simple debt relief where you are eligible for debt relief proportionally to your income tax debt.

You do realize there are car manufacturing plants already in the U.S., right?  Besides Ford and GM, Japanese and German companies have plants in the U.S.    If trump decides to tax them on cars they don't make in the U.S., they just might pull all their manufacturing out of the U.S., as a retaliatory measure.   What are those workers   going to do then?

Why use a scenario that's probably not going to happen lol?  Wasn't Trump talking about a blanket 20% tariff, and even higher for certain products from China?  I'll use an extreme (but more likely) example to counter your extreme (but unlikely) example.

The reason it's regressive is... imagine you're in rural Florida, you and your married partner are making $29k combined.  Under current tax laws, you're paying zero federal income tax, and paying pretty much no tariffs when compared to Trump's plan.

Now imagine you guys are making the same amount under Trump. He eliminates the federal income tax (which doesn't affect you because your income tax bill was zero before this anyway), and increases tariffs (to a more realistic) 10-20%.  What happens to your purchasing power?  Even at your unrealistic example of 1% tariff, your money would buy you less.

LG & Samsung appliances are mostly made here for example. GE also I believe.; Ummm… there are no tariffs right now?; E bay about to flourish; The original iPhone was $700 when it was released. I don’t hear anyone complaining about todays prices; Not much. I'm giving an exaggerated example to demonstrate the point that it is possible; You don't want to answer because my extreme example demonstrates the point. You would be able to buy more phones...

It could be a 10% tariff on phones and a 10% reduction on income tax. If you spend trice as much on income tax than you do on phones, then you would still be able to buy more phones... Maybe the income tax reduction comes from no more wasteful spending and a reduction of interest rates lowering debt service. Or what example you want...; ""Why use a scenario that's probably not going to happen lol?""

Because using an extreme example makes the point more obvious.  I'm not saying it will happen.  Simply that it is possible. I'm also pretty sure Trump has mentioned Tariffs and elimination on income tax.  Don't think that will happen of course.

  
In response to your example, I agree that sales taxes, tariffs on goods, etc... are generally regressive.  Lower income pay a larger portion relative to their wealth.  Your median US household does pay income tax though.  So your median American still could benefit from lower income tax and tariffs.  

Once again, I'm not suggesting tariffs are always a good thing.  They have a time and place.  I'm not saying they are necessarily the solution here.  Simply- it's possible to raise a tariff on a specific good and still enable consumers to purchase more of it by offsetting the tariff with other tax reductions.; OMG... You are still missing the point. The same levers apply in less extreme examples...; You just don't seem to get it.... You can tax a specific good more and still enable people to purchase more of it by lowering their overall tax burden more. Why don't you understand this?; >car assembly plants. They don’t manufacture, they assemble.  

Semantics.  Assembling piece parts into an entire product is manufacturing.   Ok, regardless, foreign companies pull those assembly plants from the U.S.  I'm sure the people out of work will be comforted to know what you define as manufacturing.

>Yes, i buy a phone every 4 years, i am okay with that.  

Ok. Most Americans are not.  They got used to their cheap Chinese electronics.  Tripling the price on these will cause a revolt, which maybe is a good thing.  And don't say, ""well, we will just make them in the U.S.""  You don't set up a large electronics manufacturing line up overnight.  And there are only a few PCB vendors left in the U.S. High-volume PCB fab is done in China.; I worked for a Toyota plant in the US.


The inputs were American steel in big rolls and cast metal blocks from American foundries. The dimensions for the steel was even in Freedom Units. These were cut and stamped into car parts onsite. The engines were bored out, milled, had some of their gears cut, all onsite (others supplied by usually Japanese companies, but often also actually made in the US).


I worked in the Body Weld department, between stamping and paint. Stamping was where the long steel rolls would stop looking like big rolls of toilet paper and start looking like car doors and wheel wells. In Body Weld the actual parts get assembled and welded by robots into an actual car body. Paint was then where the parts got painted to their final color and to avoid rust. 


After that all the interior fitting out happened, again with usually Japanese companies manufacturing seats, infotainment systems with a mix of origin countries. 


When you start with raw steel and aluminum and end with a car... my friend, I'd say that's bona fide manufacturing (...and then also assembly).; Ok.  Sorry, I'm still trying to read between the lines here.  

So are you saying, in the event China takes over Taiwan, and hence TSMC, companies like ASML will refuse to do business with China?  ASML will take a moral stand over profit, and not provide new equipment or support for old equipment?  

If so, you have a much rosier view of corporate thinking than I do.; Interesting, the news said yesterday he didn’t but clearly he did.; You're right. Trump lies like a fish breathes water. Maybe he'll never enact those tariffs.; So, you think tariffs drive prices down for manufacturers? Gurl, you're not an economics major of any sort (and you also edited your post because you knew how wrong it was and tagged manufacturing in); I’m mostly familiar with fridges and washing machines.; No, you wouldn’t because your money would have to go towards other things. Car maintenance because your roads and highways will be fucked up. Healthcare because you’d have to pay for all your expenses out of pocket.  I don’t think you realize what your income taxes go towards. Oh right and you’d still end up paying more for other goods because of the tariffs too.; >Your median US household does pay income tax though. So your median American still could benefit from lower income tax and tariffs.

The bottom half will probably be paying more if we do get universal tariffs.  With tariffs in the 20% range, even if you make the median household income, you're probably going to pay more.  If you're single and making \~$60k, your effective federal tax rate currently is lower than 10%.  If Trump tariffs are 20%, what he says he wants them at, I have no doubt you're going to be paying more, even if federal taxes get eliminated.

Now, if you're making $500k a year, your effective federal tax rate currently might be somewhere around 28%, and with 20% tariffs and elimination of federal taxes, you could be paying less overall.  But let's be honest, are these the type of people that really need help right now?

Not to mention, the other countries will probably enact their own tariffs in retaliation, as we've seen from the last time he was in office.  Remember when US farmers were struggling because China pulled back from buying US farmed goods, and Trump had to give farmers billions of dollars in aid?  Typically, before Trump tariffs, we gave farmers around $10 billion a year.  In 2019 and 2020, it was \~$23 billion and \~$32 billion respectively.

All I hope is, someone educated will be advising him not to do 10-20% universal tariffs and elimination of federal taxes, because median income earners and below will be worse off, and US debt will balloon.

>Simply- it's possible to raise a tariff on a specific good and still enable consumers to purchase more of it by offsetting the tariff with other tax reductions.

I'm basing what I'm saying on what Trump is saying.  I'm not sure why you keep spinning what he says to fit your narrative.  Where did he say he's only doing tariffs on specific goods?  Personally, I'd be fine with reasonable targeted tariffs, but Trump is saying 10-20% universal tariffs and even higher for specific goods from China.  Biden raised tariffs on Chinese cars in order to protect US automakers/workers.  If it's specific and targeted, I don't have a huge issue with it, but that's not what Trump is saying...; I think you're the one that doesn't get it; That's pretty cool.  But how long ago did you work for this Toyota plant?  Just curious.   

Because with U.S. Steel on the auction block, I wonder about domestically sourced steel.  Maybe the Japanese company that wanted to buy them might keep the steel mills in the U.S. open.  But if that sale gets blocked, unless Trump wants to spend taxpayer money to keep them afloat, they're just going to shutter.    

As for the rest, I'm not surprised that the machining operations were done onsite.  I've seen some pretty impressive machining techniques.  Ironic, though, that a Japanese company would do those operations in the U.S., while U.S. car companies probably do them in Mexico.; They will not sell EUV machines to China now and they are ending supply and maintenance of DUV machines to China when those contracts expire.

Fine. You mistakenly assume that the money is already being spent perfectly efficiency but it's not. The lower tax collections force government to spend it's money more efficiently and we end up with the same service at lower cost. We get rid of bloated contracts. We fire the useless workers.

Or the tariff causes the profitability of domestically manufactured phones to rise. This leads to the production of cheaper US phones and an increase in tax revenue due to additional corporate tax income.

I understand where my income taxes go to. More gos to debt service at a national level than to roads...; >The bottom half will probably be paying more if we do get universal tariffs.

There is no way to know any of this until we know what new tariff and tax policy is. Tariffs are a tool in the toolbox. Sometimes the correct tool, other times not.

What are you talking about? I'm not trying to fit anything Trump says to any narrative. 

I have been saying the same thing over and over- You can raise a tariff on a specific good and still enable the population to purchase more of it by offset the cost elsewhere.  

My point was not about Trump or Biden. I agree targeting tariffs are generally a better policy.; So you believe any time tax on a specific product increases, then you will have to buy less regardless of external factors?

I am genuinely curious - do have some source talking about ASML not selling to China?; The whole point of tariffs is to create a specific economic incentive- to incentivize on-shoring. If that’s a moral good there’s nothing intrinsically wrong with that incentive.

>What are you talking about? I'm not trying to fit anything Trump says to any narrative.

I just didn't understand why you're bringing up **targeted and specific tariffs** in the context of Trump when he proposed **universal 10-20% tariffs**.  That's all.

>President-elect Trump has promised to impose steep new taxes on trade, including a 10-20 percent tariff on all imports, at least a 60 percent tariff on Chinese imports, and a 25-100 percent tariff on Mexican imports.

What you're suggesting is something that might happen in positive in scope in 8 - 10 year time scale. I didn't meme you, I'm challenging your ridiculous assertion.

Can I do my own trading with a rollover IRA?,"I have a 401(k) from a previous employer, and I’ve always been unhappy with its performance. Since I need to roll it over into a new account anyway, I’m curious about doing so in a way where I could do my own trading. If I rolled it over into a Roth IRA, would be able to trade on the stock market with it so long as I didn’t withdraw any before retirement age?

I was looking at Fidelity to do just this, but at first glance it looks like I have to choose one of their plans rather than do the investing myself.

Fidelity absolutely lets you pick your own stocks and ETFs - no need to stick with their pre-made portfolios. Just make sure you understand the tax hit when converting to Roth.

Most people here do a mix of index funds (like VOO or VTI) for the core portfolio, then individual stocks they research themselves. Way better than those cookie-cutter 401k options with high fees.

Qualcomm pops on chipmaker's earnings and revenue beat,"Qualcomm reported fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat Wall Street expectations for earnings and revenue, and the company guided to a strong December quarter.

The shares rose 10% in extended trading at one point before falling to a gain of about 4%.

Here’s how the company did versus Refinitiv consensus expectations for the quarter ending Sept. 29:

Earnings per share: $2.69, adjusted $2.56 expected

Revenue: $10.24 billion versus $9.90 billion expected

Qualcomm said it expects revenue in the current quarter of between $10.5 billion and $11.3 billion, with the midpoint of that range beating LSEG consensus expectations of $10.59 billion.

The company reported $2.92 billion in net income, or $2.59 per share, a sharp jump from last year’s $1.49 billion, or $1.23 per share. Qualcomm reported $33.19 billion in total revenue in its fiscal 2024, a 9% increase from 2023.

Qualcomm’s fortunes have historically been tied to the smartphone industry, where the company provides a range of chips to handset makers, including system-on-a-chip processors, modems, and antennas. The company makes the chip at the heart of most high-end Android devices, and many lower-end phones as well. Qualcomm also sells modems and related chips to Apple for its iPhones, and last year said its contract for 5G chips ran through 2026.

Qualcomm reported a 12% increase in handset chip sales to $6.1 billion, in line with FactSet estimates. Qualcomm introduced its high-end chip for 2025, called Snapdragon 8 Elite, in October.

“In handsets we delivered greater than 20% year-over-year growth in Android revenues,” said Qualcomm CFO Akash Palkhiwala on a call with analysts.

Under CEO Cristiano Amon, the company has diversified away from being a smartphone supplier and has introduced and invested heavily in producing chips for PCs, cars, and industrial machines.

“We will continue to transform Qualcomm from a wireless communications company into a connected computing company for the age of AI,” Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said on the earnings call with analysts.

Qualcomm has also made efforts to brand itself as a leader in AI, having developed smartphone chips with specialized parts for machine learning since 2017. But unlike Nvidia, the company doesn’t produce the kind of graphics processors for data centers that are used for big AI programs like OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

The automotive business grew 86% on an annual basis to $899 million in sales. Qualcomm says it has billions of dollars in business with automakers currently in its development pipeline, and highlighted it was the fifth consecutive quarter of growth. Qualcomm said that it expected automotive sales in the current quarter to rise 50% on an annual basis.

The company’s “internet of things” business includes both chips for industrial purposes as well as the chips Meta uses in its Quest handsets and Ray-Ban Smart Glasses. It also includes the new business selling chips for laptops running Microsoft Windows. The division reported $1.68 billion in revenue, a 22% increase from a year earlier.

Qualcomm’s chip business, including its handset, automotive, and other chips, which together is reported as QCT, saw sales rise 18% during the quarter to $7.37 billion in total. 

The company’s profitable technology licensing business, QTL, reported $1.52 billion in revenue, a 21% increase over the same period last year.

Qualcomm said its board had approved $15 billion in additional buybacks. During the fourth quarter, it repurchased $1.3 billion worth of shares and paid out $947 million in dividends.

Their automotive segment is exploding - 86% growth is insane. Plus that $15B buyback shows management knows the stock is undervalued.

The diversification into AI, IoT, and automotive is exactly what they needed to do. They're not just riding the smartphone wave anymore. That 5G iPhone deal through 2026 is just the foundation now.

The automotive pipeline is the real story here. Five straight quarters of growth. 50% projected growth next quarter. That's where the future growth is coming from.

Nvidia Overtakes Apple to Become World's Largest Company,"
Nvidia stock was rising early Monday, pushing its market capitalization past Apple's to make the chip maker the world's largest company.

Nvidia shares were up 1.4% at $137.35 in early trading. The stock rose 2% on Friday.

That gave Nvidia a market cap of $3.365 trillion, just ahead of Apple's $3.338 trillion, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

Continued high spending from big technology companies on artificial-intelligence infrastructure, including the company's Blackwell processors, look to be a more fundamental driver for Nvidia stock.

""We have further raised our big tech capex forecasts following the quarterly results last week. We now expect their combined spending to grow 50% this year to $222 billion, and another 20% to $267 billion in 2025,"" wrote Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a research note.

Intel shares were down 2.9% in morning trading.

Apple is against growth headwinds. Nvidia seems a one trick pony, albeit a pony that farts sparking rainbows. 

Microsoft is a 10 headed hydra. Soooo many businesses with 10B+ revenue run rate and many new ones being incubated.; Sure, picks and shovels - but construction material never ends up operating the building…. Bubble has formed. There will not be enough energy not enough people to consume the data. One day maybe but not the next 10+ years to sustain this valuation. Heck of a show for them!; Crazy.

Apple has a diversified cash flows, and its brand is a de facto moat.

NVIDIA has no rival, but that could change. Its profit margins are fragile.; When is AI going to start to actually making money from end users?; Wait till it goes down. This is the second dotcom bubble—an AI bubble if you will; why does anyone care about this? seems like a useless metric to me; They’re basically the same with how they move daily. Apple may over take them tomorrow; Nvidia is the Apple of our time. This will also be the first to $10T; Man. Missed opportunity. Jumped in 2023.; ive been looking to make some moves on my nvda / aapl positions... but keep getting fomo due to my loss in TSM; shouldnt the headline be most ""valuable"" company vs. largest?; Jesus Christ.

Clearly I do not know enough about the economics of AI because this seems insane to me. Maybe it's just a perfect storm as they're the only game in town for Crypto mining as well. 

I don't invest in individual stocks at the moment but I don't see how much upside this could possibly have at this valuation especially with a PE of 63.

Seems like another Tesla to me, but I'm thinking I need to jump on whatever the next hyped up bandwagon stock is because they always seem to win, even if for a short while; Good; They also just got the kiss of death from the Dow.

NVDA has been up 3x for me from $1m to $3m. The next 3x to $9m will be much harder!; I remember all the posts saying it was overvalued at $20 and the move to $30 was unsustainable.  Then we had 300 comment threads on a bunch of redditors rallying up to try to short it.

These are the same guys who said the iphone was a flop and no one would drive a tesla when they can drive a gas car.

They all deleted their comments or don't post anymore out of shame.; Wow.; I just want cheap cards man…; Another one for California the failed state.; Hope it hits 500 again; Just to be a bit nitpicky on semantics. Largest and most valuable (by market cap) are two entirely different things. No tech company is even close to being the largest other than maybe Amazon. 

For example, Nvidia employs about 30,000 people

Walmart employs over 2 million. 

Just goes to show how efficient Nvidia's business model is, but in the great big scheme of things they are a relatively small company that is worth a freaking boatload because their profit margins are absurdly high.; This still has a nice 2-3 yr upside run left, while the apples and Microsoft’s are pretty much on autopilot; My gtx 680 is worth 250k.

If I had used that money to buy Nvidia back in 2012........

So my pc is worth 250k.; When 5090?; Nvidia is going to own the world at this rate, or at the very least be able to afford the $7 trillion Sam is asking for to build AGI lol. Selling the shovels for this endless gold-rush while also helping develop gold technology, it's a win-win.; Valuable doesn't necessarily mean largest.... Smh; Nvidia's recent performance is indeed impressive, especially the huge returns on its investment in artificial intelligence infrastructure. With the rapid development of AI technology, companies like Nvidia that focus on graphics processing units (GPUs) and data center processors seem to be leading this wave of technological revolution. In particular, their Blackwell processors may become a key driver of the market in the next few years. However, it is worth noting that although Nvidia's stock price is currently high, it still faces challenges from competitors such as giants such as Apple and Intel. Although Apple has an advantage in hardware design, Nvidia's leading position in AI and graphics processing undoubtedly gives it a place in future technology investments.; Largest? I think that should be measured in employee count. Not market cap. 
But you do you.; Take the W for being honest with yourself though.; At the same time I am perfectly happy to entirely sit out buying any of their stock personally. I missed out on the window of gigantic growth other than my passive investments. I just feel like the risk relative to the reward is not worth it.; same. i went in on TSMC 

under the theory that surely these big techs are gonna get bottlenecked waiting for NVDAs, and follow GOOG in making their own AI chips (also like apple did to intel a few years ago)

which i still believe will happen btw, and will make NVDA severely crash

but it appears i got the timing wrong... and oh boy did i lose out on a lof of freee money.

for those interested though:

-- as per Sam altman on reddit a few days ago, openai is already constrained by chips. they cant launch stuff, and have to deprioritize projects due to limited resources

-- as per MSFT earnings call last week, Azure cant grow their datacenters fast enough to support demand. they will go elsewhere

-- meanwhile GOOG just has *WAY* more compute than everybody. theyre not waiting around in line for NVDA. i mean, they are, but they have their own line too

https://x.com/EpochAIResearch/status/1844050216993136724

this is only going to play out one way. MSFT and META will onboard their new chips (which are already fabbed btw, since 2023) and soon custom silicon will be the way. with TSMC still making all of them. *ALSO* i think GCP is gonna scoop up a lot of these customers who are getting denied by Azure for the simple reason that they have compute and azure is constrainted

either that or gen AI itself crashes.  but thats even harder to time; I think that the thing that works so well for NVIDIA is that their stuff works so well for just about everything; every time there's a new hyped up trend in the tech space, it's massively helpful that NVIDIA hardware is good at doing it from the get go, rather than NVIDIA having to start from square one after the trend starts (like with so many Intel projects).

Like yeah, it works well for AI, just like how it's good at being data center/computer hardware, just like it was good for mining crypto, just like it was good playing games, just like it etc etc.

And then the things that NVIDIA isn't good at, they just don't enter that space in the first place. NVIDIA doesn't have to compete in the CPU space when system integrators are doing Ryzen CPU/NVIDIA GPU builds.; I bought it when crashed during the chipmaker crash ,it was 149$ and thought to myself hey,no way it won't recover back to 250$

I sold it for 450$.....; Yep, I sold out just before the ai hype train arrived thinking it couldn't keep going up. I just always liked their video cards since the original GeForce. ; I bought in a ~$12 back in 2020. Did not fathom it would grow and AI would become such a big deal 2 years later. I thought things like “chat bots” were a decade away or something 😂; If you haven't already, take Chat GPT 4 for a spin you'll start to see the potential power there is for just getting answers in a conversational mode; We might be astonished in a couple of weeks when this happens again; Lope stock will probably rise higher. Unless you were an early investor the dickriding for Nvidia is insane ; It looks like an insane PE, but it's really hard to figure out what kind of multiple a company should have with a moat like theirs.

Not only are they the only game in town, they're going to be very hard to catch in the future because their R+D is ahead and CUDA is more or less providing standardization within the ecosystem they supply.

They have better tech and a head start than other players, plus Apple-like lock-in for their customers. And their customers are companies like MSFT and AMZN and META, lol.; They have similar PE ratios. Tesla's is 67.25; Apple and Microsoft aren’t growing as quickly; Full disclosure I own MSFT but I would counter your argument that a jack of all trades is a master of none. Microsoft if anything has too many fingers in too many pies and while I grant the fact its focus is 90% on winning the AI race its that last 10% difference that may make the difference between victory and defeat.; Just curious what makes you bullish on Microsoft? Copilot seems to have been fairly insignificant so far. They have continued to increase Revenue on the existing lineup of products but haven't produced anything meaningful. Without being OpenAi's cash cow  they would be most likely trading at a lower multiple. Bo6 reviews arent looking too hot either right now; I have been hearing this for years now. I guess people think if they just keep saying it they will eventually be right I guess.; I don't understand why you think their profit margins are fragile. Building and designing GPUs and the software associated with them is an extremely complex and time consuming process. Their closest competitor is AMD and they are nowhere close to being to their level.; no one will rival cuda.; It will not for most of the ai products, thats why sooner than later this bubble will crash. Ai is oversold at the moment and will take decades to reach a state where it matches what most companies are marketing right now.; Businesses are adopting it more and more. Like most products, adoption starts slow, then something else creates that catalyst effect and it takes off from there. It's slowly coming, but there will be a time when someone finds that thing that makes it explode.; The money comes from using it to shrink headcount; It’s a bubble and it will burst; Many businesses are finding AI to help with internal optimization vs customer facing products. If a business can be 10% more efficient, there is a huge cost savings to the company that shows in the bottom line.

We’re already there.; It's gonna take some time. It's essentially a brand new industry that for all intends and purposes didn't exist as a commercial industry until 2 years ago; People have been saying this for years and lost out on so much money; I agree that NVDA just reminds me so much of CSCO, which was also the biggest company in the world at one point. 

For now it's better to have too many rather than too few of their chips, but as soon as demand slows there's going to be a massive glut of chips that will drop NVDA's profits like a rock.; People aren't talking about the illegitimate earnings from multiple tech giants that are propping up the entire stock market... much less the market makers pumping these bags so hard for collateral.

Shit is going to get ugly. I've been saying that for 3 years now but it's only worsened.; You don’t use this as a metric for investing; it’s just quite a big thing to become the worlds biggest market cap stock. This is just news.; yeah why would ANYONE care about what the largest company in the world is?; In the past the largest company has generally outperformed others for about a year following the take over.

But yea it is just news to be made news for the most part, I’d say. It doesn’t *really* matter, but from that perspective most things don’t.; This metric is only useful to prove how deep we are in a bubble.; same reason that people care who the richest person is, or the highest person, or the basketball player with the most championship rings, etc.; This has been my opinion for several years as well. Those that bought Apple 20 years ago are now up about 200x folds. Right now Nvidia might be much more expensive than 7-8 years ago, but I do believe Nvidia still has room to run for years to come.; People saying NVDA is like Cisco are missing the fact that the big GPU buyers will need more compute over time to make their AI better not less. And unless there is a huge loss in cost they can continue doing that for awhile; That's understandable, but what people don't understand is that their GPUs and software are a new form of computing. Neural networks now is to what computers were in the 1980s.; Sooo many and some created new accounts. Shit i bought at $630 pre-split and didn’t think 1k is possible and then here we are!

So, Walmart, Amazon, McDonalds etc.; I did buy it and make some money since I was pretty laser focused on chips in 2022-2023 already, but I sold waaaay too early.; If you own spy, vti, or any other broad market etf, you have exposure to nvda; I'm very bullish on Google for similar reasons. I also agree that there is a big incentive for companies to design their own chips directly with TSM rather than allowing NVDA 60% margins in the middle- that's on the 5-10 year time scale though. I feel as though AMD has a short term opportunity to pick up marketshare in datacenter gpu since they could use their wafer capacity on MI300s to fill where NVDA's undersupplying, but that doesn't seem to be showing in their results.; The reason is that the effectiveness of a gpu/chip for AI is largely dependent on the software and algorithms that other people build. Sure google has their own tpu (which is only available via gcp btw), and amd is trying to create a gpu while supporting rocm, and other big tech companies are creating their own chips, but the largest misunderstanding you're making here is that hardware is the most important thing you need to do ai workloads. In reality, you need the software ecosystem, since the field moves so quickly. In the past 1-2 years, we have gone from the introduction of FlashAttention, to FlashAttention v3, which is optimized specifically for hopper architecture gpus. And by the way, this is just for the transformer layer, it doesn't even account for the hundreds of other layer variations people come up with (which are always optimized for nvidia gpus in the first place because that's what everyone uses). And why would use non-nvidia as a researcher, you would just be making things more difficult for yourself. This is just a single example, and you can see how just having this optimized attention layer will speed up things by a multiple 2 over v2!! And, in the past few years, the software ecosystem for nvidia has only become greater with the release of open source models. Because with open source models, you can guarantee that one company (like google), cannot own the best model, and you can spur open source development, which is best for nvidia because most people operate within their software ecosystem. Guess who is releasing those open source models? Meta (SAM and LLaMa and more). And I have a theory that's probably why meta was such a large customer early on, because they may have been given some sort of incentive to do open source releases for ai models since it ultimately benefits nvidia. By the way, this is why no one uses tensorflow/jax anymore, since google tpus works the best on tf/jax, but nvidia does not want to support them. As such, nvidia supports pytorch more, and thus the entire community mainly uses pytorch. So yeah, ai is not just the hardware, it is the software ecosystem. And ai is not just chatgpt, it is search relevancy, recommender systems, computer vision (object detection, segmentation, ai generation), etc. So many uses cases, so you need the software ecosystem in order to be efficient in AI development.; > meanwhile GOOG just has WAY more compute than everybody. theyre not waiting around in line for NVDA. i mean, they are, but they have their own line too

I’m not knowledgeable about Googles hardware, so I’m genuinely asking this: Is Google positioning itself to be a hardware supplier for other company’s AI ventures? The reason I ask is my understanding is NVDA’s power is that it isn’t heavy in providing AI services/research themselves, but instead they’re the go to hardware provider for those who want to start up/maintain their own AI services. That makes them insulated from the “how do we monetize this/offset the massive research costs associated with AI” because they’re just providing the fundamental tool for others, and then it’s up to others to answer the hard questions/spend the big money, in the same way that the paper company doesn’t need to figure out how to market a book, their money is made the second the paper is sold. Google meanwhile seems to be in a defensive position where they’re looking to leverage AI to protect their already dominant position in search.

So if Google is hoping to position itself as a manufacturer for other companies, then that opens up a brand new revenue stream for Google and puts them in position to potentially eat market share from Nvidia, etc if successful. If Google is just manufacturing enough to supplement their own AI needs (in other words, if they’re prioritizing AI services over hardware development/hardware manufacturing infrastructure), then it’s less of an exciting venture because they’re at the same level of other software companies where they’re pouring lots of money into AI in the hopes of a long-term payday. Not to say that the latter couldn’t be good too, it’s just a question of what strategy I’d be more interested in, and as a layman, my preference isn’t worth much.; [removed];  If Tsmc could produce more, then I think Nvidia would buy more.; GenAI crashes; So, if you look at TSMC, AMD, etc. The difference is that although they manufacture the chips for nvidia, they do not own the software ecosystem. There is no moat, other than the fact that you have an army of hard-working asians working for you.; The issue is their customers are all making their own chips which will be cheaper

The hard part is manufacturing, not design.  And TSMC manufactures them.  That means Microsoft can design their own chip and have TSMC manufacture it.  

(This is, in fact, exactly what they’re doing it.  The concept proven to work as Google did it already.  And Apple did it for their CPU.); A PE of 60 seems like fair valuation tbh; Microsoft is the number 1 or 2 player in a crazy number of sectors though, with many of them being really big sectors.; And as someone who works in the IT space, dealing with microsoft products is heinous 90% of the time. Azure and ADO are probably their best product stacks right now, and even those are often a pain to deal with, tons of deprecated features, outdated documentation, much needed basic feature requests that have been languishing for years, and 10 different locations you have to visit to administer anything.

That's not even getting into Windows and Office which are the software equivalent of an emphysema patient kept alive only because of Microsoft's desire to maintain lock in.; I think that's true if you're trying to be an appliance manufacturer, energy provider and healthcare equipment manufacturer (looking at you GE).  Microsoft definitely has a lot of fingers but they aren't quite as varied.  Xbox is probably their most outlandish position.  Otherwise they're structured more like one company with a bunch of divisions.  Whereas GE is multiple independent companies, with maybe some shared services between them.; They got Excel, bro; As someone that works in IT, the moat around Microsoft is insane tbh. For all the reasons Apple can suck money out of their customers locked into their ecosystem, Microsoft can as well…except their clients are businesses of all sizes around the world.; OpenAI is actually not making any money and MSFT's investment in OpenAI has booked them a loss of $1.5bn. Copilot is still early but they said some 70% of F500 already use it and they adopt it at faster rate than any of Microsoft's new 365 suite. Their AI products are very promising.; big tech simply won't pay billions to a company that designs chips. This is what Intel thought before Apple ate them; For training maybe not, for inference it's hard for GPUs to compete with purpose built inference chips ala Groq, SambaNova or really big chips with fast memory (Cerebras).; Businesses are adopting it because of investor hype and fomo. Those businesses eventually need to *actually* make money of off it. Which means end users need to pay for it in one way or another. Where is that happening and at what scale?

We’re 2 years in and still waiting on a “catalyst” to prove that this is the most valuable technology in human history? Doesn’t seem like a good idea to base an investment on that level of hopium.; It’s me. I’m the guy who lost all the money.; Meanwhile you've missed out on 3 years of gains.; why are the earnings illegitimate? If anything tech giants outside of nvidia and tsmc are pouring billions of capex expense which is actually making their earnings lower.; 😴; Right, why would they? I see the value in knowing companies X and Y are among the largest, what I’m asking is how it’s relevant in any way that X just passed Y by Z amount for the Nth time. This isn’t a sports league, it’s not a race to the top; So how deep are we?; exactly :); People who make this comparison are clueless. GPU design is way more research intensive and proprietary than networking; You've just made me think actually. How does Quantum Computing play into all this? Last I heard there was some genuine progress being made there. I know they're nothing like traditional GPUs but if they become commercially accessible could that shake things up?; Yeah I bought around 150 (pre split) and sold at 912. Should’ve let it ride longer but I was convinced it was at the top.; That's two W's then! Could be worse, some people shorted it lmao.; Same for me, bought October 2022, sold April 2023 lol; Passive investments likely refer to these.; I'm playing the long game investing small and regularly on a  bi weekly basis, this has made my day, cheers dude 👍; TSM burned me during the bust (took me years to break even), but I'm considering buying in again now that their US production seems to be thriving.; What you’re saying is simply copium 

TPU and its software stack have been good enough for Anthropic Claude 3.5 (Reddit widely views this as SOTA) as well as Gemini which has 2M token context, way more than any other model of comparable quality



Sure maybe Meta and Microsoft will take longer to have their own be good but it’s coming; To be clear the nvidia killer would not be TPU — it would be Microsoft and Meta making their own chips.  TPU is just to show that yes it is possible

Look no further than H100 purchase.  Meta and Msft bought 150,000 each, and Google only bought 50,000. 

What would happen to nvidias forecast if their two biggest whales (by a LOT) msft and meta slashed their orders by 2/3?


to answer your question Anthropic and Apple are using TPU.  but that may just be happenstance

Google is competing to be top lab themselves.  Google wants to *USE* their compute not sell it.; I would like that.  The bigger the bubble gets the harder the eventual pop will be but I donno. Somehow it’s eluded all critical thought 

Metas gonna get dinged but it won’t be until G / M get dinged for spend that it might pop.  Given they are printing money in their core business it may be awhile; This is incredibly wrong.  TSMC has an ENOMROUS technological moat.  No one can match their node process nor their scale. 

Look what happened when Qualcomm tried to use Samsung; >The issue is their customers are all making their own chips which will be cheaper

Yes but will they be any good or usable on a large scale?

Microsoft also designed its only mobile operating system but nobody used it and it was eventually discontinued.

Most ML programming languages were designed to work with CUDA and so much of the legacy code is made to work with Nvidia.

These days it's hard for students to complete homework assignments with a PC that doesn't have an Nvidia chip so I can't imagine enterprise systems making the switch.; Yeah ""let's just design our own chips, how hard can it be, right?"" 🤡; Hence their R+D and operating environment being well ahead of everyone else being relevant.; lol; Sure, why not?

Again, most models are not a good fit for NVDA's context.; Fair point; Microsoft's greatest weakness is also greatest strength. All that legacy spaghetti code that they maintain in their OS just so some DOS program created back in 1989 still somehow by an act of god works on a Windows 11 machine. 

You can't say the same for any ancient software created for OSX or Linux without some enthusiast programmer or paying a 3rd party dev company a king's random creates some kind of compatibility layer due to the radically different kernels of when the program was first created to the modern OSX/Linux kernel we have today.; That's not an apples to apples comparison. CPUs and GPUs share many similarities but are built and designed differently. 

If you think that Apple for example is going to start building GPUs, you are going to be waiting a long time.; GPUs will be king again if the main architecture for models changes significantly; ChatGPT has already transformed education. Soooo many students are using it; 2 years is nothing in technology. lol. Its gonna take time but its clear the AI revolution is significant; 2 years and you already start complaining? Lmao some of the AAA game can takes 5-10 years.; Who said I missed out?; no one forces you to read em; Thats what she said.; Deep.

Like the years 1969, 2000, 2021...; I know nothing about quantum, but I imagine it will be a long time. I assume it requires it's own OS. I assume it's not compatible with current software. You probably need to learn an entirely new language to develop for it.; I mean, that's still a 6x! isn't that what stock pickers usually \*hope\* to get out of a 20-year investment? and you did it in two...

if you pulled it after the double-up, I'd say you did good...but you held and stuck to your best estimate and got 3x that, so I'd say you did great!; Yeah that was always a dumb idea to short it. Playing a loser's game there.; Chips made in their US-based plant wouldn’t be subject to Trump’s tariffs, right?; Okay, so the reason for this is because google has a stake in anthropic, and gemini is from google, so for sure they are going to use TPUs. Currently, I agree that claude is probably the best LLM for most use cases, but the field is dynamic and it's hard to know what will be the best a year from now. And yes, the software is there, but there is a reason why most people don't use it. Even if the software is there, it doesn't mean that it is easy to use, or if it is the most efficient as well. Anthropic and Google use it because Google has a stake in anthropic, and will obviously push to use their own product. But what I'm saying is zoom out a little bit, because LLMs are not the only thing that AI does. It's much more than this. And you cannot have one company to compete with the dominant software ecosystem.; Yes, I'm sure they have an advantage as to why they are so successful, I don't deny that. But i'm saying that a rocket-ship like event is unlikely to happen with TSMC, since there are alternatives if there is ever a bottleneck. Nvidia is able to charge such a premium and corner the market due to their software ecosystem. See other post.; antrhopic and deepmind aka 2 of the top 3 AI labs are using custom chips for their frontier models so... yeah?; Not true; I don't know that that's so true anymore. I've had a lot of problems running legacy software in newer windows versions, to the point that running it in WINE on Linux works better in many cases. Especially with older games, a lot simply refuse to launch on windows these days. Fallout 3 for example does not run in windows 11 out of the box. I had to use WINE to run software for a plotter from the 90s that refused to recognize the serial connection in windows 10.

It's also not that big of a benefit. Legacy software is horribly insecure, and most admins will shank you if you try to run it on an internet connected machine. In the business world, the solution is usually to slap a compatible OS version on a VM and airgap it. This is pretty common in my industry where we have a lot of industrial control software for big old machines that would cost hundreds of thousands or even millions to replace. We have VMs and airgapped physical boxes running DOS and NT for example.; Old thread, I know, but FWIW Apple already builds GPUs. The entirety of Apple Intelligence infrastructure runs inference on Apple Silicon. M-series chips have powerful and efficient GPUs.

Apple Silicon happens to cost *far* less per GB of VRAM than Nvidia's chips, almost a tenth of the price per GB.; Folks underestimate how flexible the inference chips are. They are basically just streaming tensor processors. It's unlikely we invent a topology that isn't still fundamentally matrix multiply and moving a bunch of memory around.; lol, in a good way or bad way; People who only consume things have no concept of how long it takes to create things.; Why invest when you expect things to get ugly only for it to worsen? Put your money where your mouth is or don't moan about things getting ugly only for it to happen at some point in the next 10 years so you can claim to be Michael fucking Burry.; He didn't read anything but the headline anyway; 2021?!; And with bonds at 25 year lows, they sure look tasty.; I just remember hearing about some breakthrough a few months ago on r/Science a few months ago. I know very little about it and where in the development cycle they're at, except the fact that the computational power would be magnitudes faster than normal hardware, to the point where if/when they become viable, passwords could be cracked in a matter of seconds or minutes.; Yeah exactly. Took the profits and put it in sp500. Never go broke taking profits. It doesn’t keep me up at night that’s for sure; It depends on what the actual language is. It might not be, but Trump has also suggested that incentives/help for foreign companies to make plants in the US would also be removed, so even if a US-based plant would get around the tariffs, the act of building one might be harder under Trump.

Source: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/28/trump-accuses-taiwan-of-stealing-us-chip-business-on-joe-rogan-podcast.html

Specifically:
 > Trump also suggested foreign companies shouldn’t be able to enter the U.S. and use government money. “That chip deal is so bad,” he said. “We put up billions of dollars for rich companies to come in and borrow the money and build chip companies here. They’re not going to give us the good companies anyway.”; Japanese cars in the 80s killing us automakers, look at history.  Sometimes short term pain is needed for long term gain.; Sorry but you seem to be misunderstanding the entire point here. 

It’s not about Google stealing nvidias market share. It’s that they simply buy way less nvidia chips themselves.  

It’s about meta and Microsoft simply ceasing to buy nvidia. They make up 66% of nvidias sales.  

(G got 50,000 H100s.  Microsoft and Meta cumulatively bought 300,000.  Everyone past that bought negligible amounts except maybe Amazon)

Players outside the mega labs simply don’t matter.  AI spend is highly concentrated in like 3-4 companies.  If these 3-4 companies follow Google and buy way less nvidias when they can, nvidia sales go down, they can’t sell at 10x markup and their 70x PE ratio goes bye bye; I'm not saying I know what will happen but the ability to replicate a technology does not mean it will receive mass adoption.

Nvidia makes chips which are vital for gaming, crypto, and AI.

They have plenty of rivals for each sector but they remain **the** company.; That is not an argument.

If you have one, make it.; If we are going to nitpick, Apple doesn't build standalone discrete GPUs. Apple Silicon is a CPU/GPU/Neural engine all in one chip designed specifically for consumer device usage. It was not designed for training LLMs.

I'm not saying Apple can't build discrete gpus but there is a reason why they aren't just selling their chips to the broad market outside of their devices.; People get so oversensitive about this stuff.

I'm sure during the dotcom bubble people who said it was probably a bubble got yelled at too.

Yelling at people won't prevent you from losing money if it pops, chill out.; Yes, apparently our current standards of encryption would instantly crumble with quantum computing. That's literally all I know about it :D; Thanks for the source-based response! “Not giving us the good companies anyway” when TSM is building a plant in Arizona is a typical Trump lie lol.; Yes, lets break this down.

So first off, regarding the concentration in ai spend. I do agree about this, and this was a point of concern for me a while back as well. So google and microsoft and amazon buy large amounts for sure, but it's also because they have cloud businesses. So in their cloud busiinesses, companies that run on the cloud (which is pretty much most large corporations), need to use nvidia gpus for their ai workloads. So, although it seems that the biggest techs are buying the majority, the demand is still pretty mixed because they buy it for their cloud customers.  Meta is probably the largest individual buyer (they use it for themselves because they don't have a cloud business), but meta is going crazy in AI with all of the different work they're doing (not even LLMs, but outside like recommendations, etc.). So props to them.

So the point of contention here is whether the biggest tech companies will cease to buy nvidia. And that's the point I am also trying to make with the software ecosystem. Because nvidia's software ecosystem is the dominant ecosystem, it is not only more training efficient to use nvidia gpus (faster inference for models, as well as more efficient/faster training), but it is easier to use as a whole, since more people use it, there is better documentation, as well as coverage for different AI use cases. And it is important that not only the mega labs are on nvidia gpus, because a lot of the cutting-edge stuff happens in university research labs as well, such that the most optimized algorithms are built for nvidia first and foremost. So the question is that how much is this software ecosystem worth, is it work the premium that you have to pay for nvidia. I would say that explains why nvidia is able to sell their gpus at such a markup compard to other tpus.

The concept of the software ecosystem is very difficult to understand if you don't work in the space. But it's real and very powerful. Why do you think nvidia's revenue has skyrocketed in the past 1-2 years. TPUs and AMD gpus and meta's inference accelerators have existed DURING the time that these big tech companies ramped up spending. And the fact of the matter is that the largest datacenters right now are built with nvidia gpus. This will only further the software dominance of nvidia. Imagine all the software that goes into parallelizing training/inference workloads.; For AI research there is no such thing as mass adoption.  5 labs use like 90% of the chips. It’s literally about the behavior of a few firms 

And some of them have already switched 

If meta and Microsoft switch it’s basically over

Meta and msft are making their own chips so they will, for sure. Just no one knows *when*; I have a sneaking suspicion that inm808 is an ai bot. Not even joking.; Anthropic and Deepmind (aka the two leading labs aside from OpenAI) use TPU instead of GPU.  And achieve state of set results. 

TPU designed by Google, manufactured by TSMC (who makes gpu)

So clearly other ppl can design chips at a comparable level.; True, but it's highly likely that Apple isn't using typical consumer chips in their datacentere. I wouldn't be surprised if their chips deployed for Private Cloud have been altered to focus more on the GPU side of things.

If you mean that Apple will never sell dGPUs to the public - yeah, I agree with that.; …. But the mega labs aren’t all on nvidia.  This was already disproven 

The top labs are OpenAI Anthropic and Deepmind.  2/3 of those are not using nvidia. 

Cloud customers aren’t doing a lot. Vast majority is simply the mega labs working on their own projects.  

This is reflected in cloud because OpenAI spend is Microsoft azure revenue; Anthropic spend is GCP revenue.  But make no mistake, it’s almost entirely mega lab spending. 

Meta proves this.  They have zero cloud customers and bought the same amount as Microsoft.   It’s all for their mega lab. Pretty strong support for the idea that OpenAI is consuming most of Microsoft’s. 

In summary - spend is concentrated in mega labs, and, it’s a FACT that mega labs *DO NOT NEED GPU* to be on bleeding edge.  given that 2/3 of them are on TPU

FYI OpenAI doesn’t even use CUDA. https://openai.com/index/triton/

Meaning 3/3 of top labs don’t use nvidia software.   No moat; Usage does not equal comparable characteristics.

Some people driving Toyota Corollas and some people driving Bentleys does not mean they are comparable products.

Aside from that, you are not addressing CUDA, which is hugely consequential.; The estimate is 40% of GPU sales are derived from MSFT, GOOG, AAPL, AMZN and META. Tesla, Oracle, Chinese Tech, and Sovereign States are estimated at 60% of the purchases. Don't forget that the US government and other Sovereign States are going to lie back and not be players in the AI space.; Firstly, Triton's language currently only supports nvidia gpus since its built on top of cuda. And as I said, google has a stake in anthropic, and google deepmind is google so obviously they are using TPUs. Outside of this, basically you have research labs across the best universities, globally. I mean most of the ml papers i read on arxiv are implemented all across different university and research labs. Flash attention by tri dao was from princeton btw. Not to mention, meta's lab is very prestigious, and literally every company has internal teams working on ai development (more tailored for industry). Of course, all the big tech companies are working on their own accelerators, but these are not mutually exclusive. There is a reason why nvidia has stayed dominant in the past 2 years despite tpus existing, etc. I guess we may have to agree to disagree here, otherwise we are going to go back and forth all day on reddit. I'm just really passionate about investing so I love talking about companies.

Do not underestimate the cloud customers. Major big companies in different industries still have to tailor AI for their own use cases, and the software that is needed is built on top of nvidia first and foremost. I disagree that spend is concentrated in mega labs, because there is so much value to be made in the industry.; It’s not just “usage” —- they created the *bleeding edge AI models*. 

It literally proves that nvidia chips are **not needed** to make frontier AI research. 

These don’t use CUDA so why is that relevant (other than to show that CUDA as well is not needed); https://www.statista.com/statistics/1446564/nvidia-h100-gpu-shipments-by-customer/; > disagree that spend is concentrated in mega labs

Prove it; also triton is *not* built on top of CUDA. It compiles directly down to llvm-ir (bypassing CUDA entirely). They just don’t support AMD because why would they, their lab uses nvidia

But when they switch to Azure Maia chip, they can easily just change low level triton compiler for the new instruction set; Needed? No, but that was never the argument to begin with.

> These don’t use CUDA so why is that relevant

lol. The mature software suite is in many ways more important than the chips."
"Boeing: Navigating Challenges, Securing Growth—A Resilient Investment Opportunity in Aerospace","**Boeing as a Potential Investment Opportunity**

Boeing stands as one of the most important players in the aerospace industry, with a heavily established brand and legacy that commands trust around the world. Despite recent operational and financial challenges affecting its stock price, Boeing’s intrinsic value and reputation position it as a viable investment. While relatively short-term setbacks have impacted shareholder sentiment, these issues are likely irrelevant in terms of Boeing’s long-term prospects as a leader in aviation. For a company of Boeing’s stature, resilience and success are inevitable, making it a viable investment opportunity amidst doubt in the markets.

**Boeing’s Brand Strength and Market Perception**

Since its founding in 1916, Boeing has had a long-standing reputation for safety and reliability. The company has bolstered its reputation through engineering marvels like the Boeing 747. Although Boeing has recently had many notable incidents, they have focused on being transparent and open with its shareholders. For example, production issues with the 787 Dreamliner, delays in the 777X program, software glitches affecting 737 MAX deliveries, supply chain disruptions, and quality control concerns have been openly handled by the company as they have been in direct communication with the National Transportation Safety Board in order to improve and learn from their mistakes. Another key factor is brand loyalty. Boeing’s brand strength is comparable to companies such as Coca-Cola and Apple. This loyalty and strength has been based on customer trust, market stability, innovation, and collaboration. Ultimately, Boeing’s long-standing reputation allows it to build strong brand loyalty, further bolstering its position in the aerospace industry and ensuring its continued relevance and resilience in the market. 

Boeing has a huge brand name that involves years of experience in the market, which competitors like COMAC and others lack. Boeing also has government contracts on military vehicles, with the V-22 Osprey and Air Force One being two of the most well-known. Three years ago, Chinese airframer COMAC landed on the US government's blacklist of “communist Chinese military companies,” where it could face sanctions and other boycotts. This shone a negative light on COMAC’s reliability. In combination with its long standing history of serving US citizens, Boeing is set far ahead of their competitors.

**Operational Challenges and Financial Setbacks**

Boeing has faced several operational and financial setbacks that have significantly impacted its stock price, including manufacturing delays and supply chain disruptions, particularly in the production of its 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner aircraft. Additionally, protests from employees and labor unions over working conditions have strained internal dynamics, contributing to production slowdowns. Financially, Boeing has struggled with rising costs and has faced accusations of fraud and misleading investors, including a high-profile lawsuit related to the 737 Max crashes. These issues have collectively damaged investor confidence, further pressuring Boeing’s stock performance as it navigates these challenges.

Boeing’s financial strategy has recently centered on a significant $10 billion credit agreement aimed at facilitating recovery in the wake of industry challenges. This move not only addresses immediate liquidity needs but also signals confidence in long-term growth prospects. The funds are expected to support investment in new technologies and production capabilities, enhancing Boeing’s competitive position. 

**Sustained Market Demand for Aircraft**

Boeing’s $400 billion order backlog highlights sustained demand and supports financial stability amid challenges. Orders for key models like the 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner show strong client confidence, positioning Boeing for recovery as it addresses production issues. This pipeline of demand reinforces Boeing’s market position, providing investors a solid foundation for long-term growth. 

The global demand for air travel has received significant growth over recent years, particularly in emerging markets such as China, India, and Southeast Asia. Rising incomes, urbanization, economic growth, and an expanding middle class are driving increased travel in regions like China, India, and Southeast Asia, contributing to a broader shift in air travel trends. These areas are experiencing significant growth in demand, caused by economic expansion and government investments. China is on track to become the world’s largest aviation market by the mid-2030s, with massive infrastructure projects underway. India, supported by initiatives like UDAN, is expected to become the third-largest aviation market within a decade as air travel increasingly replaces other modes of domestic transport. In Southeast Asia, countries like Indonesia, Vietnam, and Thailand are seeing strong growth, with low-cost carriers making flights more accessible. These regions will shape the future of global air travel, where infrastructure and sustainable technologies will be essential.

**Valuation and Investment Prospects**

Since its 52-week high, Boeing has dropped 40%. This fall in share price is due to ongoing production delays, regulatory challenges, weakened defense contract demand, broader economic concerns, and disruptions from recent labor strikes affecting suppliers. In 2019, the stock price was a staggering $430. This peak came before the 737-MAX crises and the COVID-19 Pandemic, Boeing has dropped nearly 65% since then. Through Boeing’s fall over the past 5 years, their competitors, Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, and Northrop Grumman have grown 85%, 75%, and 94%, respectively. Despite this divergence, Boeing still has a 15-20% market share in the Defense and Aerospace Industry domestically, in addition to their 45%-50% stake in Commercial Aviation as they are in a duopoly with Airbus. Additionally, Boeing's extensive order backlog signals strong demand, suggesting a potential path to recovery as global air travel rebounds. While challenges remain, addressing these operational hurdles could enable Boeing to leverage its dominant position in aerospace, driving a potential comeback toward pre-pandemic performance levels.

**Key Risk Factors Impacting Boeing**

Boeing has a number of regulation issues like the recertification of the 737 MAX which was heavily scrutinized by the FAA and other aviation authorities. The aircraft was allowed for flight but Boeing’s continuous oversight and compliance has been a focus since 2021. Boeing has also had production quality issues, specifically with the 787 Dreamliner having damaged parts, unsecured fuel lines, and multiple other issues. Additionally,in 2021, the European Union proposed stricter emissions standards which may affect Boeing’s future production practices. Boeing continues to be under investigation for various issues under the FAA and other global aviation authorities about lying to regulators about the safety of aircrafts and cutting corners.

Boeing's Defense and Space division has struggled with substantial challenges over recent years. Despite its strong foothold in defense, Boeing faces ongoing challenges including production delays and quality control concerns in key programs like the KC-46 Pegasus and P-8 Poseidon. Additionally, the company has struggled with significant cost overruns and navigating a competitive landscape. Despite this, Boeing is committed to innovation and improving efficiency, which is vital for securing future government contracts. On the other hand, marred by years of glitches, Boeing has also faced over $1.6 billion in cost overruns and delays in its space sector. Boeing’s Starliner project has faced many setbacks, while their rival, Elon Musk’s SpaceX, has made 43 visits to the International Space Station since 2019. As a result, Boeing is considering selling this project and stepping away from the space sector after over 60 years in the industry. However, NASA and Boeing are actively working to solve these issues to get Starliner up and running once again, which, if successful, could diminish some concerns associated with the company’s future in the space sector.

**Boeing’s Path to Recovery and Future Outlook**

In conclusion, Boeing’s promising potential for recovery is characterized by two factors: its substantial market share/strong brand image and how harshly the market has reacted to the company's setbacks, ignoring major potential in the company’s extensive order backlogs. Boeing’s major losses, such as the pandemic-incited 737 MAX crisis, allegations of fraud in overstated production goals, federal investigation into regulatory non-compliance, and quality control issues across multiple aircraft models were largely managerial issues that are being priced in too harshly, ignoring the fact that Boeing maintains a notable global presence in the aerospace industry. Approximately 50% of the machine supply in the commercial aircraft market is due to Boeing, the other 50% belonging to Airbus with Boeing also controlling about 20% of the Defense and Aerospace Industry. These statistics emphasize the company’s strong presence, highlighting that the managerials issues of the past can be overcome.

",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gjd018/boeing_navigating_challenges_securing_growtha/,0,"You repeatedly refer to Boeing has having a strong brand image. I disagree with this characterization. In the past it definitely did, however the long string of very public failures (some fatal) have severely tarnished that image. In short, the name Boeing is no longer synonymous with quality engineering, far from it.

There are two things Boeing has going for it. The first is the duopoly with Airbus. There is so much demand for new plans, and only 2 major companies that can provide them. Airbus couldn't take more  market share from Boeing if they tried, they don't have the excess manufacturing capacity. So on some level, airlines have no choice but to keep buying Boeing planes.

The second is US national security policy and it's focus on preventing further US manufacturing decline. This is one of the few items that is bipartisan even in today's polarized political world. Boeing would almost certainly be bailed out if it fails. HOWEVER a bailout won't necessarily be good for shareholders, the GM bailout wiped out shareholders.

In short, I think Boeing may be far from doomed, but it's also far from a slam dunk investment."

So, let's say I buy such a product, 10X on Apple. If Apple crashes 12%, do I lose **more than** my capital? Here, I'm talking about 12% loss in a day, and not 6+6% over two days, which could lower my investments to near-zero but not zero or negative.

If I do end up owing money, how's this any different from buying a future?",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gir2yn/3x_5x_10x_etps_how_do_they_work_during_sharp/,26,"The most you lose is 100% of your capital because you’re not responsible for the debt.; From my experience with ETN's they usually have a clause in the PDS where if the underlying falls a certain amount where the leverage would basically cause an equivalent of a margin call, the whole ETN gets liquidated. Because a lot of these products are structured using futures or options, I believe they operate the same way.

But yes, if it crashes so badly, you essentially lose all the money you used to buy the product. Look at xiv and svxy when volatility exploded back in 2018 for a historical example. Edit; Also, no, you don't lose more than you put in, at least with ETNs, which is the point of the clause.; No, you can’t owe money, only lose your principle investment; There is no 10X ETP as far as I'm aware.    
MAG5.L Fact sheet:

> You cannot lose more than the amount invested, and an intraday rebalance mechanism
is designed to cushion the largest intra-day falls.

Personally I can't wait for a 100x ETP:  
https://testfol.io/?d=eJxNj0FLxEAMhf9LznPoXoQtiIiLePAg6kGRpcROpkazMzUzdlnK%2FHejFewtj%2Ff48t4Mg6RXlDtUPGRoZ8gFtXQeC0EL4ICiX6nFnVCg3ThA%2F95xDIKFU4Q2oGRy0GN%2BC5KO0Db%2FogtKn8Z4JlQ5GUmTCMehO3L0P9mzpjoYk5aQhJNVeZkh4uHvL8eJctnxxN4KmVv0y14pWXeMPV0v9B3yL7xw%2F0G6QJbbzDyeHu8vbs83TWORkbSnWGxHdavQ1eXDzdPa3m7r3oFXHGxP3ddvrTxm0Q%3D%3D; The strongest leverage ETPs you can get are generally 5 fold leverage.

Even at 5 fold they tend to almost go to 0 atleast once a year, for instance Mag7 on 5x daily leverage ETP.

This is because of the affect of compounding.

If you take 100 now remove 10%, its 90%  
Now add 10% back, its 99 instead of 100.

This gets more impactful the more an asset drops within a day.; You only risk the amount you put in. IIRC ~1.7x is the optimal amount of leverage based on the history of the stock market.

I am comfortable holding 2x ETF’s for long positions (QLD, etc.) but 3x and higher I’d only recommend for day or swing trading.; Cool.. then they're excellent for wait n watch situations like US elections.. 


 when you don't want to fully risk your capital (by leaving cash aside), but also have a FoMo in case there's a sharp upward move.; Dang I thought there was a maximum legal allowed amount of leverage capped at 3x but I guess not!; I think there is now, but MAG7.L is an EU product."
Buybacks or IPOs? Which is better as a retail investor?,"My take:

**Advantages of Buybacks**

**1. Boosting Share Value**: Buybacks reduce the number of shares outstanding, which can increase earnings per share (EPS) and can lead to a higher stock price.

Eg: Apple has a series of buybacks for billions of dollars that has benefitted a lot of shareholders.

**2. Boosting Investor Confidence**: Buybacks can boost investor sentiment. Investors interpret it as a sign that the company expects to perform well in the future.  

**Advantages of IPOs**

**1. Growth Potential:** IPOs provide an opportunity to invest in a company at an early stage, potentially reaping substantial rewards as the company grows.

**2. Market Sentiment:** IPOs often attract considerable market attention and investor interest, which can lead to initial price surges.

Example: Paras Defence was listed at a premium of 171% leading to instant gains for buyers in a short time. It does not end here. The share price surged by another 143% within 3 weeks giving more gains to the shareholders.

While buybacks are good for existing shareholders as they can sell their shares above the market price, IPOs provide decent prices for retail investors to accumulate shares in case they are able to get allocation for the applied IPO.

Globalstar and Apple expanded partnership ,"Does anyone have anymore information on Globalstar GSAT and Apple AAPL expanded partnership? Is GSAT a buy after the 40% rise in share price?.

Here is some information I have , but is there anything I should be aware of ? 

The expanded partnership between Globalstar (GSAT) and Apple (APL) could bring significant long-  term benefits to Globalstar's stock, though some challenges may stil lie ahead.  
Potential Positive Impacts  I. Revenue Growth: With Apple prepaying up to $1.1 billion and committing to pay additional  service fees, Globalstar can expect substantial revenue growth. The agreement is projected to  more than double Globalstar's annual revenue compared to 2024 levels, primarily driven by the  new satellite network's capacity and performance milestones  2. Market Confidence: Apple's involvement and the substantial upfront payments provide market  validation for Globalstar, boosting investor confidence. A stronger association with Apple, along  with its 20% equity stake in Globalstar's satellite network, reinforces the viability and demand for  satellite-enabled connectivity, especially in remote and underserved areas
3. Future Expansion Opportunities: The network's design and expanded ground infrastructure  allow Globalstar to potentially explore new revenue streams, including other high-reliability  C  industries (e.g., maritime or government sectors), beyond its arrangement with Apple cOwews  
Potential Risks  
1. High Dependency on Apple: The partners. p heavily ties Globalstar's growth trajectory to zero.
3. Future Expansion Opportunities: The network's design and expanded ground infrastructure  allow Globalstar to potentially explore new revenue streams, including other high-reliability  industries (e.g. maritime or government sectors), beyond its arrangement with Apple.
Potential Risks  
1. High Dependency on Apple: The partnership heavily ties Globalstar's growth trajectory to  Apple's needs and future directions. If Apple shifts its strategic focus away from satellite  communication, Globalstar's revenue and stock could be negatively affected,  
2. Execution Risks: Globalstar must deliver the new MSS network according to Apple's  performance milestones. Failing to meet these milestones could result in reduced or delayed  payments, which would likely impact the stock negatively.
In the near term, Globalstar's stock may experience heightened volatility, as its year-to-date  performance has already been variable. However, if Globalstar manages this partnership successfully.  it could see sustained growth, especially as satelite connectivity becomes increasingly relevant to  tech giants like Apple.

It would be worth checking out how healthy their constellation looks at the moment.


Looks like they may have dropped the ball on their non-apple business. They haven't released a new phone since the GSP1700 came out 10+ years ago and that may be out of production


Their spot messengers are getting a bit dated


Stiff competition from iridium,starlink,inmarsat,Thuraya


ASTS & friends nipping at their heels


Low bandwidth capacity


Asset tracking business quite small; The investment isnt a huge amount for Apple either. Wouldnt surprise me if in 5 years they say phuck it we're using irdm or some other company for satellite services and let gsat die; Look into MDA....the satellite manufacturer they are likely to contract out to

under the radar mostly but it's already starting to move. Still early innings of gains imo.; Poor Globalstar!  Yes, they have the Apple connection and they are trying their hardest to succeed.  At current, $1.38 per share why not be a part of this company as well as the others?  The price is right and when Apple gets serious, they will be a good producer.  I have a low stake 300 shares @ 1.43 so I’m still waiting for them to improve.   Take that as a hold for now, and they have nowhere else to go but up.  Long hold.; Long hold. With money, things and technology can improve; Try r/gsat; My speculation is that this is the first step to Apple cutting out the middlemen.
First, the towers , Verizon, At&T, T-Mobile, etc and they don't want new middlemen like Starlink and Space Mobile so they are getting a 20% stake in GSAT with the goal to eventual buy the entire company once it's been proven to work. They have already booked 80 % of GSATS capacity for the future.; >ASTS & friends nipping at their heels 


And offering a vastly superior product. 35 mbps instead of dialup equivalent speeds, 4g/5g instead of text only, sub millisecond latency instead of seconds, better signal strength and penetration indoors and under cover due to their low bandwidth capabilities which is only an option for ASTS due to the ridiculous size of their satellites."
Brk’s latest portfolio change,"if i read it right, 

significantly up in AXP, minimumly up in Ko, cash

I don't own AAPL but I woudn't cut anything solely because Buffett or others did.

If someone can make a very strong case w/reasoning in a fund letter for selling/buying something I'll certainly consider that, run it through the filter of my own goals/risk management etc and make a decision but doing something just solely based on a headline that someone sold something? No. 

Someone else in this thread said this: ""Otherwise you don't really have a plan, you are just following someone else and hoping on hope it works out."" and completely agree that's not a good approach.

Lastly, I've noticed on Reddit in recent years that people more and more just seem to dump something entirely. What happened to gradually selling a position? People either all in or all out.; > does any one plan to cut Aapl holdings per this? 

No, virtually no one will make an investment decision based on BRK having 300 million shares of AAPL instead of 400 million.; Just buy BRK if you want to follow buffet; It almost sounds like you are trying to run your brokerage by buying and selling the same stuff Buffett does.  I don't know if it needs to be said but it absolutely isn't going to work. For starters, (and there are many, many flaws with the plan)you aren't going to be able to buy for the same prices Buffett did. You'd be a whole hell of a lot better off just buying all Berkshire stock. But to answer your question, no. Nobody with half a brain is going to cut their positions just because Warren Buffett did. His investment thesis is his and yours SHOULD be yours. Otherwise you don't really have a plan, you are just following someone else and hoping on hope it works out.; Aapl has an earnings yield of 2.7%. Assuming slow growth in the future, bonds paying 4.3% is the better investment.; >I  don't own AAPL but I woudn't cut anything solely because Buffett or others did.

This guy ain’t perfect by a long shot. 

If he was gonna sell half of  it at $180 six months ago, why wouldn’t he sell more around $220?

Makes sense to me. ; even buffet isn't buying BRK at these levels lol; Yes. Borrow ideas from others but never outsource your decisions; It’s almost like Berkshire needs to rebalance their portfolio because they have internal limits on how much can be invested in one stock.; how the hell did you derive this conclusion that i run my whole portfolio purely per buffet’s move? some redditors are indeed half brains; Nope; Because you asked if anyone plans to cut their apple BECAUSE Buffett did AND you mentioned you cut loose of bac after holding for 3 years and a 1% gain. The latter question combined with the former makes it sound as if you are trying to copy trade Berkshire but are second guessing yourself. I never said you did or are, I asked if that is the case."

>**It is being widely reported that Berkshire's operating earnings declined 6.2% in the quarter.

Earnings really grew 8.5% in Q3 to $11.2 billion against $10.3 billion and were up 18.0% for the nine months to $33.0 billion from $28.0 billion.

So much speculation from succession, new administration, new tax fears to market being overvalued.

Also Berkshire energy is growing as well.; Imagine having so much cash you could literally set a few million dollars on fire and no one would notice.; With $325B and Berkshire who tries to keep their stakes below 10% for companies in their portfolio, I don't see any other viable replacements for Apple.

They probably wouldn't invest in another big tech company.; I don't understand how he can hold this much cash and not still not be subject to c corp accumulated earnings and profit tax.; And AAPL bought back 95b worth of shares this year; My guess is it’s a mix of Apple no longer aligning with their investment philosophy, Berkshire preparing to pay more tax, insurance float, wanting to be ready for a big acquisition, and perhaps even giving Abel more flexibility when Warren passes. The cash pile makes Berkshire more attractive IMO. It’ll dilute their returns but protect investors on the downside when the market corrects.; out of curiosity, what does owning that much stock in a company mean? Do these companies consult Berkshire? do they have special privileges?

I know about ""activist investors"" and their ability to enact change through votes, but I'm wondering more like, what does this mean for day-to-day? do they call Warren Buffett before making big decisions?

and on the flip side, you can't just sell that much stock at once without consequences, do they generally work with the company to do so? or only when they are friendly?

https://www.currentmarketvaluation.com/models/buffett-indicator.php; He’s planning to bury it on an island and let the world know on his death bed; I didn't read the article, but it sounds like apples?; Buffett has long said that he doesn't let who may or may not win an election influence his investment decisions (as have most super investors), so that's not it.

The new tax fears does seem to be part of it from what he's said about Apple in particular. He's basically said that in his opinion taxes can only stay at today's historic lows for so long when the deficit is so massive and voters concerns about the government's long term financial health are growing. And that when push comes to shove he thinks that higher taxes will ultimately win out over massive spending cuts (or that we'll get both). Hence why taking some profits now is preferable.

But Apple's valuation, and very low growth over the last few years definitely have to also be playing a part in this as well. Earnings growth determines a stocks long term performance, and if you don't have much growth but have a very high PE ratio than the room for out performance is definitely much lower.; Berkshire tax rate is in 20%. They do pay fair share of taxes because of their equity portfolio and domestic businesses. I don’t think a new tax code would be detrimental for them considering they have been through it all from 60s to now.

My two cents are simply insurance coverage is expensive, and no matter how much cost they pass into you, they need better capitalization than ever. And honestly, I rather overpay for insurance that is going to reimburse me than underpay and get screwed.

When it comes to cash, TBills pay over 4%, and realistically, there ain’t many cheap opportunities at Berkshire size or even value for them. The S&P is trading at around 30x.

All and all, Berkshire is in essence insurance company. That Cash belongs to Geico. And other businesses like Energy and railroad are capital intensive especially now. It would be more alarming if Berkshire doesn’t carry a sizable amount of cash. Insurance companies usually carry 60-80% of float in Fixed Income not Equities; Berkshire's portofolio is only normal because it is Berkshire

Capital allocation is art not science, and Berkshire benefits largely from the fuck you attitude towards analysts and funds.

I think it suits Berkshire better than Apple; He could buy Chrysler from Stellantis and save Jeep/Ram/Dodge/Chrysler from the French.; I’m sure he’s got enough lawyers and CPAs to handle this nuance.; Isn’t this a consolidated GAAP basis & not necessarily how tax on the individual holding level works?; In 2007 when the first iPhone came out, their entire market cap was 95 billion. Pretty crazy; Dumb question, but does buying back shares reduce the outstanding shares float?; He’s buying Oklo stock ; I'd love to know the answers to these questions too; https://www.worldoil.com/news/2023/12/1/occidental-jet-visits-warren-buffett-s-hometown-amidst-potential-10-billion-shale-deal/; Probably very little, I think the market already suspected he was continuing to sell. I don’t think the market is irrational as most people.; They just did the biggest buyback ever this year?; anyone with an ounce of business knowledge knew Apple is fool’s gold. Their products cycle less frequently, their innovation stagnated. Their entire growth was based on an amazing cash pile and solid earnings. They are losing market share in the consumer electronics market. Very bullish on Meta.; >It is being widely reported that Berkshire's operating earnings declined 6.2% in the quarter. No. The reported figures include unrealized currency losses in 2024 and gains in 2023 on BRK's debt denominated in foreign currencies, largely yen. Earnings really grew 8.5% in Q3 to $11.2 billion against $10.3 billion and were up 18.0% for the nine months to $33.0 billion from $28.0 billion. Just as short-term movements in equity prices can distort the reporting of operating profits, so to do currency swings on debt outstanding. Both should be excluded from an analysis of operating and economic profit.

Per Christopher Bloomstran on X; Can someone explain that?  Who listens to radio anymore?; If he's still alive until the next recession that is; Yep that’s usually been his MO for the past 70 years. Sell due to a short term concern like being dead.; its been priced in; That's why I buy it. Something more, at least what I think, stable than a couple of my ETFs.; That thought process checks out with me. Shouldn’t crash ~AS MUCH; ""The closing price for Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) in 2008 was $64.28, on December 31, 2008. It was down 32.2% for the year""

https://www.statmuse.com/money/ask/berkshire-hathaway-stock-price-in-2008; They’re very defensive. All the major ETFs and mutual funds hold them. Apple isn’t growing but keep printing cash and buying back stock. I think they’ll be a boring money printing machine moving forward that gives you 20% cagr with little downside risk. They haven’t grown in over 2 years and keep appreciating.; 1% of it; Bunkers in Hawaii don't forget. It's pretty hard for the majority of people to get to that island. 

If if they are preparing for civil unrest, zombies, a comet etc, they will be on an island with others like them so it'll just be like the rest of us, but with more money which may not matter. And in the end, everyone dies one way or another. Once Zuckerbergs battery drains and the last solar panel can't charge him, he too will power down or his ship will collect him.

Also, if a comet is going to hit earth, I'm not sure Hawaii is the best spot. Or maybe it is, what do I know lol; They bought apple in 2016. Apples market cap during that time fluctuated around $550B

https://companiesmarketcap.com/apple/marketcap/; likely mostly in short term Treasury Bills; under the mattress; He sells when stocks are overvalued and buys when they are undervalued. As should any investor with any sense.; So..full port into INTC??; Never; And the price of goods will magically stay the same. 🪄🧙‍♀️; You're getting downvoted, but I'm not totally anti-China, so I'm curious what Chinese companies you invest in?

I like their non-military industrial complex approach global expansion. I think they're in a position to expand while the US footprint shrinks.; Because the dude bought everything 20-50 years ago lol It’s called time in the market; Because he doesnt know when. With options you can be right but timing can be wrong; He doesn't need to buy puts.

Berkshire can just buy the whole elephant.; Imagine Warren buying 0DTEs; Because he's not smart like you and doesn't realize that you should always bet on a specific up or down direction.; It would only be impressive if it's larger than Blackrock's AUM

Berkshire has 6x market cap of Blackrock; That’s not how AUM works. Most of that goes where clients direct it.; Stop I can only get so hard; 🤣; You want my treasure? Find it!; That would be Goated 😂; More like there will be a WSJ article remembering his legacy and we'll hit ATH.; That would honestly be the most badass death ever.

Only way it could get better is if Benjamin Graham came back from the dead and said “tech stocks have no ceiling, just time it right”; Did he not say that he is expecting taxes to go up sooner rather than later. So he is cashing in now; Not really.

He just has not enough investment cases right now.
Because his investment options are fairly limited to certain companies which all have high valuations right now.

He would never be as presumptuous as to claim he would know when a crash would happen with certainty. Predicting crashes is not part of his investment strategy/philosophy anyway.; He is not trying to time the market. He is selling those positions as he said they are no longer aligned with the objectives of Berk’s investing strategy. It’s easy to reinvest millions of dollars, it’s not so easy to do it with billions.; He's said that he thinks that cap gains tax will increase in the future due to the national debt.; Buffett says repeatedly he doesn’t predict macro when making investment decisions because it’s unpredictable; He just thinks Apple got expensive and took profits.  Out of the large caps that he can invest billions into, none of them are at fair prices in his view.  So it looks like he’s timing the market, but he’s just valuing stocks the same way he would if the market was cheap.; They also need to hold pretty significant liquidity for their insurance businesses, especially as natural disasters are ramping up; Not necessarily a buy strategy, but making more in treasuries; What happened to “time in the market beats timing the market”?; 1. Sell stocks to buy bonds.
2. When recession hits and rates go down, bonds gain value.
3. Sell bonds at a huge gain and start buying stocks again.; People always want to believe that it's ""due to a coming recession"". That just fits their internal narrative. Ample cash reserves are necessary in the insurance business and in the past decade insurance companies have been caught with more devastating payouts.; I doubt it. SP500 is as over priced as everything else. Earnings growth of around 5 to 6 percent and PE ratio not far from 30. ; and Ajit Jain sold most of his BRKA at all time high prices, in the 450-470 range.  that says a lot for a guy who has been with BRK since the mid 80s; He doesn't do that. He analyses business models, governance and valuations.

He's not Michael Burry.; He was betting on a recession 2024 that never came now he has to wait a few more years with his cash horde while missing more gains in 2025 likely.; Buffet has spoken many many times that he does not waste his time predicting the market.

He looks at individual stocks and whether they have the growth characteristics he looks for at the right price.; > Buffett has long said that he doesn't let who may or may not win an election influence his investment decisions (as have most super investors), so that's not it.

There hasn't been a presidential candidate running on a tariff platform before.; Oh wow, you're right.  Apple's income has pretty much stayed flat since 2022, even though the stock continues to go up; [removed]; Best response right here. He would notice 10 000 being burned; He’s got a Benjamin-sense; You could do it with $100 bills and still not run out of money ever.; Imagine issuing a fine that’s greater than all the money ever produced in the world combined; Buffet can’t invest in Microsoft because he and Bill gates are pals. Buying Microsoft is a conflict of interest for him; It's interesting that Berkshire bought into IBM like a decade ago and Buffet said it was because when he looks at the large expenses for their other holdings they're all paying a bunch of money to IBM.  I would expect the same is true, and even far *more* true for Microsoft and has been for a long time.; He’s gonna go for google; I mean Berkshire Hathaway, not Warren Buffett personally; Yes that’s the point; Usually but sometimes companies issue tons of stock based compensation, i.e., dilution, so total float may actually not change very much or increase.; Yes. Thereby having a positive impact on EPS.; Yeah, Apple gets a lot of bull options flow, if the Nasdaq holds up/pushes further, it's probably ultimately going to $250+.

Does it make fundamental sense, no, but it's possible it doesn't matter for a little while longer.; Would they need the cash to insure a massive yen carry trade?; I do, SXM subscriber.. lets me listen to boomers talk about politics, or PGA radio.. hour of driving to work every day; My personal experience with SXM- got a few months free with my new car so i tried it out. I mostly listen to electronic music and there are 2-3 channels for it. I don’t remember which one i listened for a month but damn almost every 15mins a song would repeat. It felt like they had 15-20 songs at most playing on loop. I will never ever pay for such mediocre service.; Thanks for confirming 👍 I am not the only one to think this.; How do they achieve 20% cagr without growth? They’re paying out something like 90% of free cash flow through buy backs and dividends already. Without topline growth how do they achieve anything above top line growth rate sustainably? They’re also very expensive. At 35x earnings. So where’s the 20% cagr coming from?
They can financial engineer it, like what all mature companies do, rack up a trillion in debt and maybe they can maintain 10% returns for a few years. But without real topline growth there’s no sustainable outperformance going forward.; Would you not built a bunker just for the fun of it, if you had the money? I certainly would and I'm neither a pepper nor a doomer. Personal bunkers are just awesome!; Mount Everest is the only safe haven. Didnt you watch 2012? Do you think all those sherpas are just carrying the stuff for those rich tourists? Half of their load is building materials for the secret bunkers up there. They are probably already deep into the construction of the billionaire ship ""Buffet Enterprise"" that will withstand a huge flood and have enough resource for them to stay afloat till a new empire can be built.; So when someone else sits on cash waiting for stocks to go down, they are timing the market. When Buffet does it he is an investor with sense.; He’s also spoken out strongly against options trading. Charlie even more so.; It goes without saying that a company whose cash position is 2x another company’s market cap, also has a higher market cap. The, “it would only be impressive if it beat their AUM” comment is flatly absurd.; What? He could literally buy blackrock in its entirety, and have $180 billion left.; Username checks out; Yes - this. He throughly explained the selling, yet people who do not research (even a little) continue to jump to doomsday conclusions 🤦‍♂️; Yes, but that doesn't explain why he is not reinvesting the money, not even repurchasing BRK shares.; Lack of investment opportunity doesn't explain the selling, especially for a guy who's time horizon is forever; Fair enough, then it must’ve been just rumors I’ve been told.

But then what is his strategy behind all the selling?; It may not have been before but things change over time. If he believes there are stronger signs now, he could reevaluate his decision.; So his alternative is to...sit on cash? Surely cash isn't going to gain value, so why not just keep it entirely in assets? Unless you/he is expecting a pullback...; Yes he is, based on valuation.; It’s very easy to buy SPY.; Billions would be easy lol he has 300 billion in cash… lol the only game in town is treasuries and a few select sp500 companies… or countries….; Anyone else thinks he's cashing out to cover possible insurance due to 2 hurricanes ?; Well, thats a very good point there, and a prudent move actually especially since we're not talking pocket change.  Take the win and regroup.  ; What? buffet seems to talk a lot about ""not finding any good deals"" and then when a downturn like 2009 hits he invests heavily.; It's different,  Buffet owns the watch.; They have been saying this for decades; [deleted]; And then buys at the time when the valuation make  sense to him not just blindly and consistently. Aka timing the market; And honestly. How much time u think he has left.; Also completely missed loading up on covid; Trump did back in 2016 and he passed tariffs, yet the impact on the economy was minimal; [removed]; He'd feel it in his bones.; his granddaughter ask for a loan..not a give away and he said no...YES he would notice if a sip was taken from his diet coke; especially when it's earning a cool 4.4% in treasuries.. ; That's why we do $9,999 at a time, just like the bank deposits to avoid FinCEN; Bill isn’t involved with MSFT anymore.; why do you think so?; Not trying to be a dickhead or anything but how old are you? Im mid 20's. I use youtube premium for podcasts and whatever else i'm feeling on my 45 min work commute. Most people I know do the same or have Spotify. I cant think of anyone I know using SXM. I might be in a bubble. Is it popular?; Does it still crap out every time you go under a long bridge?; Same; Investors are front running it now by assuming AI features will eventually lead to a major upgrade cycle. I’m not saying I agree or disagree, just an observation; Some will call that ""timing the market"", I'll call it waiting for value.; Yeah i've always found it weird that people say blackrock controls the financial markets and so on.

Sure they have immense AUM but they are literally just portfolio managers, not more not less. Everyone with some money can go to them and if people stop doing that, they will start having trouble; Lmao; And You believe that? Come on, if his thinking is so easily understood, he would not be among the richest. He needed an excuse for what he did to cover his real intention.; He’s waiting for kumdumblah to tank the economy so he can scoop up single family homes for cheep!!!! /s. Also in all seriousness, I wonder why he’s not a target of right wing ire like soros; They have gone on record about share buybacks for BRK.  Only at what they think its below fair value.   With them not buying back, they dont think it is trading at higher than their view of fair value for the stock; Apple traders at 35x earnings, that’s just too much for him.; So it's never a good time to take profits?; Why bother with stocks when you get 5% risk free when you just park your money.; I'm invested in stock A. I now think stock A is overpriced and decide to sell.; Taking profits I imagine; Portfolio balance; Treasuries; Selling now… helps his companies realize gains at now values… PE of 35 he is basically pulling 35 years of forward value to todays  as profit…. it can be that next year or for the next 20 years the companies are doing fine and moving well above his buy or sell price… he is hoping and thinking that he can deploy the cash better now… his bets have proven ok or poorly depending on when you look in his 60+ years of investing… the key is not losing it all or not losing so much… with interest higher now than the last 20 years… he is doing fine… he is older now…. And Brk is much bigger now than ever… 1 trillion dollar evaluation…. In the realm of things I think he is working on all cylinders…. Apple still makes up like 13% of his equity portfolio…; Nah, he puts a cash pile aside at all times to hedge. Then when there is a downturn he will buy back shares and identify good opportunities to buy low or lend money. But he isn’t a market or macro timer and has consistently cautioned against it.; Haha I guess that’s true; Not really; ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy); Charlie Munger died at 99. Most of us hope to live that long.; Tbf we have had record inflation since those tariffs kicked in, and they were targeted. If you dealt in tariffed products you noticed even back then.; Buffett was obviously referring to capital gains taxes (and probably income taxes to). Rising tariffs aren't a reason to consider taking profits now on a stock, since the taxes you paid on the gains are still the same.; Stock market dive in 2018 was directly fueled by the trade war with China.; It would piss munger off so much he’d come back as a ghost; Is this real? I mean wtf he denied his granddaughter a loan? Haha; Cherry coke.; It’s still the reason why buffet won’t do it. Gates is still a large stakeholder even if he isn’t involved in the day to day.; Check the pe of mag 7 and then realize google is best positioned to benefit from ai use in search. It’s the safest tech bet from the mega caps; 
Hahaha no worries, I get it!

I’m 36, mainly a subscriber because the package I got from GMC allowed my truck to be connected to the app so I can control the command start or lock/unlock from my phone.. peak laziness haha.

I live in Canada so the winter command start is huge, I’m also heavily invested in American politics so listen to the msnbc type of stations quite a bit. Otherwise it’s PGA radio. When I’m working I have headphones on and listen to Bob does sports/ foreplay podcasts usually.; Probably all the boomers that signed up for it years ago and forgot they are still paying for it.  I used to have sxm, mainly to listen to Stern but he sucks now.  I just use podcast addict for free and autodown loads all my podcasts that I listen through out the day.; I’m also mid-20’s and I signed up for Sirius last year.  At first I was skeptical, but paying the 10ish bucks a month to listen to sports play-by-play while I’m driving / doing housework / cooking is more than worth it.  

As an investment, I don’t see it as a growth business, but rather a good business with strong moat and purpose for existing.  I could see Berkshire buying them outright honestly.; I’m older and i listen to YouTube and podcasts during my commute. I love music but pop stations talk too much and play the same 10 songs over and over while ‘classic’ stations only play about 200 songs. There’s a lot of streaming cruft but at least I’m getting something out of it.; I’m older but not a dinosaur.  I had the free from Benz for a year each lease and then 5$/mo and I liked Eminem’s channel plus a couple others. Great deejays on shade 45 and fun music. But the sound quality is the lowest of any format I have ever heard and I don’t miss it enough to pay real money. RIP; Isn’t the control they mention the ability to direct investments by creating the various investment vehicles? I.e, they create a fund for small/micro caps and your company can be included if X; Yeah, the lack of understanding around that is vast and multifaceted.; A ton of investors and fund managers are doing exactly this though. It's just not news when a wealth management specialist at a local office of a national bank does it.; > if his thinking is so easily understood, he would not be among the richest

This seems like a strawman, because nobody said the totality of his investment strategy thinking is transparent and easily understood, they just said that this particular batch of selling is due to a fairly straightforward reasoning. The two are not mutually inclusive. 

A genius can make obvious moves sometimes.; In investing being a genius doesnt mean you are going to be richer than a person that just has patience. So that thinking is just bad.; Some of the plays are really that obvious especially when we are talking about billions of dollars. At that scale it's almost always better to take the guaranteed advantage rather than speculate.; When you watch tv, do you feel like the shows are speaking directly to you?; Because he's not Jewish.; When a honda civic is 100k, you will sell too; As it always has been since he started buying it…; You can do that if you want the bare minimum. It really doesn’t make you much, if any, money when you take into account the inflation/taxes. It just doesn’t lose you any money like a typical savings, again, when taking into consideration inflation. For short term goals, saving is fine, but for long term goals, you really want to put it in an investment to accumulate wealth.; 😂; Exactly.; Inflation averaged less than 2% for the duration of Trump's term. that is below the historical average of over 3.5%.; That is not relevant to the inflation we have been experiencing; Yeah it's real, he's a greedy monster; McDonalds; While I understand why you listen to SXM, I can’t believe we have to have SXM subscription to even access our car’s basic functions. The ability to remote start, lock/unlock, and check on the “health” of your car should not be tied to a mandatory subscription to radio, what a crock of shit.; Not only that, but I believe they can vote all those shares under management that are being held through index funds and the like. They do have a lot of power, which is different from being the most valuable company.; This might be a dumb question, but doesn't Vanguard and Fidelity do the same thing? Why does Blackrock get all the heat?; The people saying that dont even know this/think so far. But yes that's also really impactful for small companies; Because he doesn't push DEI; Look the PE up when he started buying in 2016; Stop arguing in bad faith. You already know it's well established that economic policy results trail in the wake of a presidency. Modern presidents by and large inherit the economies they serve under from the previous administration.

You might think you're talking about Trump's term, but what you're talking about is Obama's economy.; do you lie on purpose?; I’m don’t mean to defend billionaires and I’m sure buffet, like the rest of us, has made some shitty decisions. I think you’re painting him with far too broad a stroke though. 

There is a story about him buying a new car. The dealer was so excited he offered to give him the car so the dealer would get some PR. Buffer insisted he pay full price.

Buffet has been going to the same diner in Omaha for decades. A waiter there regular provides service and knows him. She has said he’s kind and leaves great tips. 

He’s given 10s of billions to the gates foundation and has pledged to give away 99% of his wealth. It’s actually hard to give away that much wealth. It sounds easy and giving away money is. But finding charities that do good work or projects to fund is hard. And you can’t just write a bigger and bigger check. If a organization is still doing R&D and only needs say $50 million to figure out if their moonshot idea can work you don’t just add another zero unless you want the ten people working there to retire in a beach after they fail. Even hunger and housing charities struggle with this. Writing a big check is great but it doesn’t solve the logistical problems. McKenzie bezos has donated so so much money but is RICHER than when she started because smartly donating is hard work and that money is invested.

As for the grand daughter thing, buffet has always been clear that his family won’t be inheriting his wealth. His has publicly said that he will leave his children “enough to do anything but not enough to do nothing”. He was pissed at her specifically because she participated in a movie that went after billionaires. Warren has always avoided this type of attention and valued privacy so it’s not entirely surprising.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-cut-off-granddaughter-152900004.html; Not giving one of your already very well off offspring 40k (!) for kitchen renovation has nothing to do with greed. 

Unless I missed the sarcasm.; No, he said go to the bank for a loan, just like any of us. He's not going to pass his wealth to his family, but he does support them with nonprofit jobs and they make a really good living. 

He's one of the billionaires that's doing it right; These billionaires are just built different. Not a single care fir the world or anything in it. Just money. It's actually quite a case study if people dived unto it.; Sorry I misspoke, it wasn’t a requirement, but for a few extra dollars I was able to get a higher tier package that included XM and I think 20gb of internet through the trucks wifi; I believe that’s the case when the shareholder doesn’t cast their own vote, and so I believe the fund managers have to vote to meet quorum; They just have the most aum, but all the significant brokers do some variation of this; Which was still high at the time and I remember people didn’t think it would go higher; It’s pretty bad faith to talk about inflation and tariffs and not mention Covid stimulus.; https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/pce-price-index-annual-change; [removed]; Yes.; [deleted]; If they were “very well off” why did they need to ask for a 40k loan?; So let me get this right.

My guy is a billionaire, won't pass down his wealth and doesn't donate his money to help societies most down and out? 

Sooo what's the point in having all that money if he isn't doing shit with it?

And this is a good person in your mind? 

Hoarding money just for the hell of it isn't a noble cause that deserves praise.; I hate to say it, but this is generally true, but you can be a ruthless businessman and also a carrying person.   The trick is you have to be able to separate the two.; One-time payment? Or subscription-based to access your truck’s basic functions?; Dude the PE was 13 back then, everyone thought that apple was a slowing business and than he started buying.; Which also majority took place under trump…; yes so go ahead and explain how those checks with Trumps signature helped cause inflation; I would absolutely not serve as some type of private bank for friends and relatives to take cheap loans from. Not only would this be a hassle to manage but also guaranteed to cause issues in the long run a la ""he got so much money, why should I bother paying back my loan"". I mean just look at this case, it made a fuss even without any money being exchanged. 

Imo Buffett did the most reasonable thing, if you want 5 digit sums to beautify your fucking kitchen, you're able to take a loan from a regular bank. 

People treat this as him denying her financial support in a time of need, not shoving a golden spoon even deeper down someone's throat.

The most funny thing is, that all those people who complain about this case, would complain just as much if somebody got 5 digit sums from their billionaire relative to buy expensive furniture.

And people seem to ignore that this ""poor child"" already received a six digit inheritance from Buffetts former wife.; Are you seriously asking why rich people take loans, especially if they expect favourable rates? And this in a stocks themed sub of all things.; #He is giving all of his wealth away through philanthropy:

> My Philanthropic Pledge
> 
> In 2006, I made a commitment to gradually give all of my Berkshire Hathaway stock to philanthropic foundations. I couldn’t be happier with that decision.
> 
> Now, Bill and Melinda Gates and I are asking hundreds of rich Americans to pledge at least 50% of their wealth to charity. So I think it is fitting that I reiterate my intentions and explain the thinking that lies behind them.
> 
> First, my pledge: More than 99% of my wealth will go to philanthropy during my lifetime or at death. Measured by dollars, this commitment is large. In a comparative sense, though, many individuals give more to others every day.
>
>Millions of people who regularly contribute to churches, schools, and other organizations thereby relinquish the use of funds that would otherwise benefit their own families. The dollars these people drop into a collection plate or give to United Way mean forgone movies, dinners out, or other personal pleasures. In contrast, my family and I will give up nothing we need or want by fulfilling this 99% pledge.

#So, yeah, I do think he is a good person. He will have a positive influence on millions of lives:

> “Were we to use more than 1% of my claim checks (Berkshire Hathaway stock certificates) on ourselves, neither our happiness nor our well-being would be enhanced. In contrast, that remaining 99% can have a huge effect on the health and welfare of others.”; No you don’t have it right. He will donate 99% of his wealth to charities when he passes. 1% will go to his wife and kids. And bear in mind 1% of his wealth is still in the billions.; You can be a ruthless businessman who cares about your legacy and reputation, but I'd be hard pressed to call anyone who hoards billions in wealth/power a caring person in a world where children suffer from malnutrition and die of curable diseases; Yes I agree. But the 1% don't seem like that. Seems all that caring Bill gates did was to cover up his many visits to epstein Island. Don't think Elon cares about anything etc. 

Billionaires are becoming more and more so I'm sure u more correct than I am. Just doesn't seem so. 

I sometimes step back and truly wonder if I was in there shoes. What would I do. Would I feel like I need to help the world. Like I do now. Or would my empathy and generosity go away and greed and pride take over. 

I'll never know lol 😆; The latter 😖; Ya and 13 was high in 2016 for Apple stock; I was not specifically talking about Covid checks. They certainly contributed to it, but the main cause was central banks essentially eliminated interest rates, continued quantitative easing, and removal ( TO THIS DAY) of fractional reserve banking requirement. On top of the worldwide supply chain disruption. This was not only happening in the U.S.. People are delusional to point to Trump and blame him solely for inflation. He certainly didn’t help by chastising the Fed to keep rates low leading up to Covid, but he was not the cause of global inflation. It is entirely bad faith to compare inflation to previous administrations without talking about the worldwide response to Covid.; Why wait till he's dead if he ain't doing shit with it now. 

I don't understand that logic.; Have you met a billionaire? Like face to face?

I worked at Microsoft in the mid 2000s and I’ve met both Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer. Not in the limelight, but regular office settings.

I was in a waiting area when Bill walked past me into a conference room. Nobody else was around. He saw me, nodded at me and cracked a little smile and moved on.

I’m a nobody, mind you. There is no reason for him to even pretend that I exist, let alone show a little pleasantry. It was hurried, but he was in a rush as he was walking fast. It’s appreciated nonetheless.

As for Steve, no direct interaction with him, but I was in a conference room and a meeting was about to start and I saw that he was nice to everyone, including staffers helping out. It’s nothing like his iPhone-stomping public persona.; Right, it still sucks that we can’t separate the two. I don’t listen to SXM but I’d love to still be lazy and have access to my car from my phone. Why don’t the car manufacturers charge their own subscription-based model for that and not have it tied to SXM/radio?"

It has a decent PE and I bet if I looked at the 10-k there's likely a lot of decent fundamentals Buffet tends to go for.; He is a big fan of hair nation; Sirius is still heavily used for more than music in aviation, marine and rail. It’s used for data link weather and other data that is instrumental to navigation. They also have a rich fixed asset and licensing.; >In this age of Spotify, and Apple Music what kind of upside does Sirius have?

not to be too snarky, but this is one of these questions: ""Everyone I know uses X, why would anyone possibly use Y or Z?"" As if there's no sensible reason anyone might prefer Y or Z. 

- About 10% of the nation subscribes to Sirius XM. 

- In addition to a zillion niche music chanels Sirius has some exclusive content attractive to certain audiences, such as Howard Stern, sports talk, etc. 

- The stock is pretty cheap by any measure. 

- Some of the margins are weak, but they've been profitable in 10 out of the past 10 years. 

- It's not an exciting or trendy company. Buffett usually prefers boring but well-managed companies, partly because they're more reasonably priced due to limited interest. Everyone's chasing the latest hot trend like cats chasing a laser pointer, and Buffet quietly buys low-debt companies that are gushing cash and growing their customer base.; It’s a value play. Good cash flow, high revenue.; I like Sirius over streaming. It feels like I'm more connected thanks to the DJs and the active rotation plus all the channels you get without having to fiddle with your phone while driving; they told him the telemarketer will call him every day if he sells a single share, that's why; That was a merger arbitrage play. There was a Liberty Sirius XM Group and Sirius XM Holding (+ even one more?), they announced some time ago that they will merge to have only one listing.; 90's on 9, of course!; He’s not just holding he has been buying more.; It’s a cash cow that requires minimal COGS or R&D; Just here to say the amount of content I get from XM for $8 per month is a steal. It’s a good service.; Satellite infrastructure is going to be increasingly important and they have a legal monopoly is some ways (spectrum rights).

That’s a moat sir, even if it’s not radio in the future.; Because the Liberty complex used to be something value investors adored. Berkshire used to own more - owned Liberty Sirius (now just owns SIRI), still owns a bit of FWONK and owned other Liberty entities at times (definitely owned Liberty Broadband at one point and Liberty Global, but appears to no longer own either) along the way.

A lot of the Liberty complex stopped working, then combine that with an absurd spiderweb of various spin-offs and transactions that became I think not worth the mental energy to keep track of, given the returns (not all of them, some have done fine but I think broadly those issues are why Liberty went from something commonly discussed 10-15 years ago to rarely heard about anymore.)

At one point you could primarily own the flagship Liberty Media and maybe there was one or two other things. Then it became, ""where did the Lendingtree stake go? Oh, they... put it with Liberty Broadband?"" and they have reorganized stakes in various entities multiple times in recent years - in 2023, Liberty Sirius and Liberty Formula One spawned Liberty Live.

 IAC another ""hot 10 years ago"" media conglomerate going through somewhat similar problems.

Why is this being downvoted? Buffett has had a constant holding in one or more of the now probably dozen Liberty entities for ages.

Stern is set to retire soon and Sirius is pivoting to podcasts; Not American. Could someone explain to me what exactly does the company do?; 3.85% dividend yield aint shabby; It's possible for good companies to be overvalued and bad companies to be undervalued. 

I'm not saying SiriusXM is a bad company, but your question implies that for a company to be a good investment, it has to have some amazing new groundbreaking technology or promise.; It’s because of paywall podcasts. It was covered in my favorite podcasts last week, The Best One Yet. Unironically, a free podcast. 
[Here’s the segment on Warren Buffet and SiriusXM](https://youtu.be/cZRXgqioJdA?t=707&si=bkDmlXJD1K4R3wiZ); As a wild guess, it probably has good fundamentals.; They also bought Pandora; Is it possible hes just a geezer that thinks Sirius XM is still relevant?; Probably the free cash flow; I use it and love it; Ask Ted and Todd; Waiting for the bag holders to come in so he can dump his shares. Obviously.; I have been holding it long enough with Buffet and have seen its price drop and I’m down 25%+…. I’m not happy with the performance but hold it due to it being a smaller allocation….. for now it stays but I am unhappy with it.; A buyout; Monopoly on satalite radio. Solid balance sheet. Dividend payer.; Data. The answer is usually the data. Gps in every car is beneficial for data gathering. They don't care if you activate or not.; Because he’s serious about his investments.; It’s best not trying to figure out why Warren Buffet has their shares but just do your own home work and if it’s for you then it’s for you. 

Mr Buffet gets those phones calls we don’t.; Their satellites actually have pretty good promise to help in the world of connected vehicle technology with distributing higher latency communications to areas that don't get cellular data.; its an arbitrage play with the LSXMK, LSXMA tickers. you could also lend shares for a while for a significant return; The infrastructure is in place so any new subscribers are easy cash flow. New vehicles come standard with trials and many extend them.; They are starting to acquire big name podcast. It’s all the foresight. They’re coming after Spotify and Apple Music; XM is also also usb for weather data for Garmin etc devices in planes especially GA; I'd presume:

1. He bought into it, and keeps buying into it, when it hits waves of undervaluation
2. He believes in its fundamentals, overall business structure, short and long-term objectives, etc.
3. He's getting a decent influx from the fairly-generous dividend SIRI offers (4.71% as of right now it seems)

Just my two cents!; He probably forgot; Age factor . Decline in cognitive abilities; Probably because they are crooks. I just cancelled my subscription because it was like $27/month and I mainly listen to free Spotify. I had to chat to cancel it. The bot came back with, “what about $7.99/month for one year.” I said no, so then it came back with, “what about $5.99/month for one year.” Still ended up canceling it.; WB is a legend, obvi, but he’s not flawless. I’m wondering how his BIG investment in US rail securities is panning out? Coke is great, McDonald’s, meh.

He also despises BTC, which imo is a poor call. Actually, it’s fine and great to be skeptical of something new and promising- but I don’t think he wants to understand and would prefer where he’s at. 

All good. Learn from him and make your own way. I would consider his Sirius holdings a solid sign for Sirius over 10-25 years. But again, let’s compare Coke and Sirius to BTC in 20 years and I think the difference will be enormous by then.; 376m isn't ""heavily"", it's roughly 0,1% of his stock portfolio; If he knows non-public info, that's called insider trading.; And he has it down to $1.02/month; Underrated comment; It's also heavily used by businesses. If you are in a department store and you hear music, theres a very good chance it's SXM.; There are plenty of dead spots. Ever been listening near a tall building or have a mountain next to you? Or go through a tunnel?; I beg to differ on dead spots. Where I live I can't even go to the grocery store without hitting several dead spots. The internet stream is actually more reliable.; I've experienced dead spots in New England with three different vehicles that have had it.; Hell I love it. Listen to sports radio, politics, music, talk radio, or any other number of things. It’s all I listen to.; Actually you can loose the signal in deep mountain valleys like yosemite.; No dead spots with downloaded music on something more mainstream. And Sirius definitely has dead spots lol; Never any dead spots? Unless you’re driving under trees or alongside a building. At least that’s how it was when I had a trial on my new car in 2013. It was spotty as hell and I never used it again.; In my eye 🎶; Don't blame me; sleeping...; For the pedestrian carrying robotaxis; Anyone know if the spectrum rights can be used for something like satellite to phone transmissions? Interesting; It’s satellite radio licenses - they are not worth anything material. They would need FCC approval to change the licenses to allow them to be used for terrestrial wireless to be worth anything. This is a long process and is not guaranteed (eg see Globalstar, Ligado etc); Aren't those rights temporary and to be payed for every year to keep them ?

In my country i lost my favorite FM station because they wouldn't/couldn't pay for the rights anymore :(; He likes to listen to Madison?; Who isn't; Is Sirius growing its customer base?; They completed that back in September. The price has fallen since then beyond any benefit of the merger play.; [deleted]; Yeah we stay subscribed at that price too, my wife loves the convenience of it in her car even though we have Apple Music family plan. And my car has been getting it for free for 10+ years for some reason it never got shut off.; basically commercial free radio over satellite for cars along with an app with the same stations.; Agreed. I have access to NFL play X play because the team I cheer for is out of state.; He’s been buying more…; The app on my phone is $10 month.  At SIRI current yield of 3.91% a $4000 investment in the stock would provide enough to cover the cost of the service.  My cell ATT bill is also coved by the dividend from ATT (T) stock.I own.; 6$ a month is cheap. How are they crooks for that price.; Since you're knowledgeable about it, what does BTC do exactly? What economic value does it provide and what is it used for?; Not if you're just holding; This is the answer. Retail stores, restaurants, etc. all use satellite radio.; Rockbot is slowly killing that part of it in a vampiric fashion.; To be fair, if you're in some long tunnel you're going to also have problems with Spotify. Unless it's a fancy wired one with repeaters. (I remember how amazing it was in Chicago when we finally got cell service in the subway portions downtown.); Are you in a city with tall buildings?; Same here. I got a trial subscription and there were constant dead spots in my neighborhood. Even with good reception, it’s overpriced compared to other options.; Sounds like hardware issue unless you’re in tunnels. ; Like a diamond in the sky; Satellite to Phone is easy; Phone to Satellite is the hard part.; They are using satellites to transmit the signal to comparable radios in cars.  The sattilies can also transmit data.  But you would need a satellite dish to transmit the data to the sattilies 22,000 miles away.  Without a dish you would need to use satellites in low earth orbit.  That means iridium satellites or starling sattilies.

The service currently has a monopoly on satttilite radio.  If you want to listen to the your favorite team in the supper boawl  in a boat in the ocean you can do that with XN radio.  The only alternative is starlelink and watch it on your laptop.; When I cancelled they asked if there was anything they could do to convince me to stay and I told them I'd renew on the spot if they fired Madison; Nah. That's a whole different Liberty ticker.; Yeah if you look at where he bought it so far this year he'd be the chief bag holder. At this point I'm convinced they are truly going long.; I agree. To go from $27 to $6 is pretty crazy.; I believe BTC is one of mankind’s greatest inventions. It’s simple on top, but has many layers of complexity underlying it. But most people can use it just like they drive a car or use bank’s ACH without knowing the details.

Also, this topic is taboo on this sub, not trying to break rules here, just reply.

In a nutshell, one can think of BTC as an international bank with its own type of currency. But the innovation is that there is no company behind it, no CEO, no nothing, really. It’s now completely self-sustaining- it’s “run” and maintained by the users themselves, and they are paid (in BTC) handsomely for that service. The incentives are quite strong to keep it as-is. It is essentially unhackable already and the resources needed to “take it down” are already out of reach for any nation-state.

And this is just the setup- so there is a “bank” that anyone can join, and an integral part of the currency is that the supply is absolutely fixed at 21 Million BTC. There is no inflation.

So, if someone in the world is getting devastated by their local fiat currency inflation, it’s possible to opt-out of that by buying BTC. 

We’re in a very interesting time for BTC right now- it’s very likely to explode in value over the next 12 months. Why? Many reasons, but mostly bc of its supply schedule (halving), continued rampant global inflation of fiat currency, corporate acceptance (Blackrock, Fidelity, Microstrategy, etc) and central bank interest rate cuts in the US and possibly elsewhere.

There’s so much to learn and get pumped about imo. BTC is THE best investment over the next decade imo. I hope more people check it out and join the financial revolution! LFG!; not to mention every new vehicle comes with the trial for it.; Rental cars always have it; Why so ? Why is it better than internet based service ?; Why are they using satellite vs streaming?; The service works great on the road between cities were you may not have cell or internet service.; Or places with lots of tall trees lining the roads or narrow roads with taller buildings around. It’s great on open highways, but it has its limitations.; I live in Charlotte and there is 1 dead spot on my way to work.; How I wonder...; Iridium would like to have a word.

Edit: I don't know the frequency bands either of these systems operate at which may be easier for one vs the other.; Maybe, but what's the rate of uptake from that?; Perk of buying a Tesla, no SXM, so no endless letters in the mail and phone calls begging me to sign up.; And then they charge you 3x the monthly subscription price to listen to it for the 3 days you have the car. I’d rather use my phone.; Satellite quality is more compressed so the internet streams are actually better.; Because it's satellite based...; Satellite strung from the moon; Seems to be enough to justify spending to keep their monopoly on it; Loose cell service = no streaming

Been there, done that, sold the Tesla haha; The only places I've lost cell service are underground parking garages where satellite service wouldn't work either."
NVDA To Join Dow Jones Industrial Average,"

Nvidia is replacing rival chipmaker Intel
 in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a shakeup to the blue-chip index that reflects the boom in artificial intelligence and a major shift in the semiconductor industry.  

The switch will take place on Nov. 8. Also, Sherwin Williams will replace Dow Inc
in the index, S&P Dow Jones said in a statement.

Nvidia shares have climbed over 170% so far in 2024 after jumping roughly 240% last year, as investors have rushed to get a piece of the AI chipmaker. Nvidia’s market cap has swelled to $3.3 trillion, second only to Apple.

They keep Intel in it until it's fallen, bringing the DOW down.  Then they put NVIDIA in after it's had a huge run.  Will it go higher?  Maybe, but at $3T valuation it can't go much higher.  If they'd swapped them out a year or two ago, the DOW would be much different.

Plus you're replacing a $100B company with a $3T company.; Neat, but why are you paying attention to the dow?; This seems like such a classic example of buying high and selling low.

I have no idea why Intel wasn't booted years ago. But putting NVDA in now jut seems nuts, especially since the DOW is typically supposed to be safe and relatively stable blue chip stocks, which NVDA isn't.; Grandma is gonna be pissed!; Does it mean AI is not a mere Hype anymore?; Another selling event for Intel! I wonder if least favorite grandson is still holding his Intel boulders.; The Dow Jones is irrelevant ; Intel truly is going to die isn't it?; This like Texas going to the SEC 💀; DOW short LETFs incoming!; It is deserved.; About F\*ing time!; Why do we care that it's joining the boomer index?

... in 2018 🥲; I invested in 2018 and sold it when it started to dip later in the year.; Me. 

I don't think companies will be over investing in ""shovels"" for long. 

FAANG will only keep paying a premium for processors until they can make a better version for cheaper. 

Google TPU will only get better.; [removed]; Had nvda and sold when it was $40. Fortunately to at least in a full US market index fund so still got some of the gains but would have been nice. At least I still have my early Tesla and AMD; That’s why you should invest in VTI; >Plus you're replacing a $100B company with a $3T company.

doesnt matter since for some reason this index is price weighted, not market cap.; Why can’t a $3T company go higher?; >Then they put NVIDIA in after it's had a huge run.

S&P Global does the exact same thing, but the larger number of stocks mute the effects. 

They added Tesla a few years ago after a huge run, then it slipped pretty substantially and was outperformed by AIV, the stock it replaced. 

They added Builder's First Source and Fair Isaac more recently, also after big bull runs for both stocks.

https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/sp-500-stocks-more-than-a-third-get-kicked-out-in-nine-years/; While HFs need Nvidia at these prices as collateral for their moronic derivatives plays, its stock price will be propped up. Just like Tesla before it.; People said that about Apple at $1T; Dow 10,000 💀; If GDP continues to increase there is no upper limit on a companies market cap. It’s arbitrary. At one point 100b was seen as the upper limit, then 500b, then 1 trillion, now we are talking 3 trillion…; Your comment makes it seem like you do not understand what the Dow Jones is supposed to be? And judging by the number of upvotes you received, neither does most of this sub? The index isn’t there to “maximize gains”. It is there to track the market (in their own suboptimal methodology compared to say the S&P 500); DJIA had also added Amazon (to replace Walgreens) “way too late”, and Amazon would have probably fallen into your own assessment of “not a blue chip” based on its multiples. Intel’s fall has been meteoric in the last few years, just like Nvidia’s rise, and I mean the earnings/influence/impact of the companies, not necessarily the stock price. It would probably have been premature to replace Intel with Nvidia say 5 years ago. Lastly, I’m not sure if there is a dictionary definition of “blue chip”, but in my book it just means highly impactful and reliable household names that will not go away any time soon, and by that definition, Nvidia is definitely a blue chip (despite its high multiples), and its forward P/E is honestly “not even that high” compared to the likes of Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon.; The only thing I can say is at least they didn’t add a total scam stock like SMCI which is now included and dragging down the SPX, NDX and RUT indexes. 🤔🤣 Seems like none of it makes a lot of sense.; They are building a chip plant in the usa..  so probably 🤷; I mean like did you 10x in the last 2 years.; Feels bad. I bought in 2011 and never sold. 421x my initial 1k. Bought 3k more in Nov 2018 that went up 23x.

Motley fool may be a scam, but the one thing it taught me early on is if you only sell successful companies you are left with junk in your portfolio.

back in the mid-1800s when the Dow Jones indexes were created they didn't have access to all the data we have today. They didn't know exactly how many shares were in circulation at any given moment. So they weighted stocks by price, which was the most reliable info available.; how does price weighting work?; People think there's only so much money to go around. They don't realize that number continues to grow. Not that long ago a 1T valuation was unfathomable.; Smci is doing well at least ;); TSMC seems to be having success with their us chip fab, Intel just isn't the company that TSMC is.; Those are two different things you are asking.; 710% I bought most of it at 155 pre split. I sold ~25% of it on that first run up to 1000. But after the split I just held because it went to 140 and then settled back down around 120 for a minute. I suspect this is going to make it run even higher since the dow is going to have to buy those shares.; Me too. 
I bought 50 shares in 2000 because I used to play a ton in college. Sometimes you just gotta take the advice of Ron Popeil, ""Set it and forget it."" It also helps that I forgot that I have it in my Roth.; Selling your winners and keeping your losers is like maintaining a garden by trimming your flowers and keeping your weeds.; Wow; [deleted]; 421 k hesus; Except I also have an experience that runs directly contrary to that.

I put 1k into weed stocks in 2015 and sold a couple of years later for 10k. They went up another 6x and everyone was making fun of me saying my continued assertions that it was a bubble was just sour grapes, and they would all 10x again.

If I had held to now instead of selling for 10k, I'd have $500 of weed stocks.

Does it seem obvious now that weed would go down, but that NVDA never could? Of course it does. It always does in these situations.

The real lesson here is just to buy the S&P500, which is what I eventually did after a few early wins but realizing I had just been getting lucky.; When you are spending billions of dollars for chips that aren't optimised for your network at a certain point it flips.

Google has millions of customized servers, they aren't buying Dell servers; they will do the same for AI GPUs.

Google doesn't have a cash shortage that prevents them from investing in more efficient cheaper chips.; just using the price of 1 share. a $100 stock has twice the weight as a $50 stock. i dont know how that works with stock splits and such but thats the gist of it; Originally to figure the Dow, you added the prices of all 30 stocks and divide by 30. The divisor gets changed every time there’s a stock split, spinoff, or company change. 

The current divisor is 0.15221633137872, which means it’s now a multiplier, and every penny price change in a Dow stock equals 0.065696 change in the average.; That was kinda what I was getting at; Oh, if you follow your companies and know they are well managed, etc., you have to hold on to your winners.  That’s how I made real money—msft, nvda, meli, aapl, most recently smci (bought at 50 sold at 770) .  This year so far I am optimistic about rklb (up 140% and rddt, of course). Sell when you lose confidence or company changes fundamentals.  (Or when your own comfort level has been reached if u must).   I learned that from David Gardner at The Fool too.; Depends if you’re investing or trading.

Very different methods and skill sets.; Not being impartial comparing new IPOs with zero profits selling their stocks in a craze to Nvidia or Apple, both cash generating machines. You got lucky gambling on bad businesses that I would never invest in. The criteria is not ""never sell"" - it's never sell just because the stock price went up. You gotta consider why the stock went up and is the underlying business worth keeping or even buying more in some cases because of good earnings.

Also I do not claim NVDA cannot have a stock price drop (I have seen it drop 30% before). I only claim I cannot time the drop and I'm only interested in its valuation today relative to where I see it in 30 years.; We will see about that.; I really hope it isn't as stupid as it sounds, since as you've pointed out the nominal price of a stock, in isolation, is meaningless.; The real cash flow long term isn't made by the people making shovels.

I can buy shovel for $20.

Building Sagrada Familia is much harder. 

The chips are worthless without the knowledge to turn that processing power into dollars.; It is indeed as stupid as it sounds. Apple's split a few years ago knocked it down from the DJIA's largest holding to somewhere in the middle.; Ok bro; Which companies will reap the profits of AI?; The ones that successfully sell subscriptions for it.

BlackRock launches ETF that expands beyond the ‘Magnificent Seven’,"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/31/megacap-tech-gets-new-blackrock-etf.html


> BlackRock’s iShares is trying to appeal to investors who want to diversify beyond from the so-called Magnificent Seven. The firm launched the iShares Top 20 U.S. Stocks ETF (TOPT) this month. It doesn’t just hold the Magnificent Seven — Apple, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. It’s made up of the 20 largest U.S. stocks by market capitalization. “What the iShares build ETFs are designed to do is to deliver a tool kit of simple solutions for investors to be able to capture the growth of some of the largest companies within the U.S. equity market today, but to do so in a broader and more diversified manner,” BlackRock’s Rachel Aguirre told CNBC’s “ETF Edge” on Monday.

> Aguirre, the firm’s head of U.S. iShares product, noted the ETF’s mission is to deliver an easy and accessible way to tap into the innovation of megacaps – “whether that be in the tech-heavy Nasdaq space or, more broadly, within the S&P [500].” The ETF, according to Aguirre, provides a way for investors worried about the concentration of the Magnificent Seven stocks in the S&P 500.

> On Thursday, the Magnificent Seven slid more than 3.5% as a group — losing around $615 billion in market cap. That’s equivalent to the size of JPMorgan Chase. However, the Magnificent Seven is still up about 43% so far year while the S&P 500 is up around 20% “It’s important for clients and investors to remember that there are split views on this topic. There are many investors who believe that the big will get bigger [and] that the winners will continue to win,” Aguirre said. “There’s also another side to this argument. There are many investors who believe that it’s actually a very worrisome time to continue investing in… mega-cap companies because of just their high valuations.”",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gh4zwd/blackrock_launches_etf_that_expands_beyond_the/,149,"Mag 7 still make up 60% of this ETF lol.

AAPL at 5.1%, MSFT at 4.6%.

So if Apple falls out of favor in terms of market cap a different company will replace it? 

Nvidia wouldn’t have been in this ETF 5 years ago but now it is.; I honestly thought that the title must have been a typo, and that Blackrock must already have an ETF that holds just the Magnificent 7 when I saw this article.

I did some research, and while I couldn't find a Blackrock ETF that held just the Magnificent 7, I did find one by Roundhill that tries to keep an equal weighting of just the Magnificent 7.; Wait so what would be the point of this ETF? Wouldn't it essentially mirror VOO?; I’ve hold MAGS in my ROTH. It’s been great. 

There’s also XLG (S&P Top 50). And OEF (top 100).; Why not just do individual stocks at that point?; Use a fidelity custom basket; This expression exists in English, too: it is drawn from Luke 5:37-39.; Down Jones Titan wenn schon. Dow Jones ist nicht so besonders; SPMO is close - it tracks the best momentum stocks in the S&P 500 based on trailing 1 yr risk adjusted returns.  Reconstitutes twice a year.  Stocks are weighted by a combo of marketcap + momentum.; Beyond MAG7, but they forget to actually weigh it beyond the MAG7.  
This is basically 50% XLK and than some other stuff.; Yeah I'd consider an ETF with them kicked out lol.; Yes I agree - either MGK or MGC at less than half the expense.  There's no real need to pay up more $ just to hold the 20 largest companies.; Because this ETF only holds the top 20 stocks.  Although Walmart is the largest company by Revenue, it is ranked #22 by market capitalization.; ask blackrock; Maybe someone can make some ETFs that combine other ETFs...; It is too hard for issuers to compete with Vanguard. The only space for them to compete in are ETFs that don't just track a major index.; Now we need an ETF that is an ETF of the top 100 ETFs.; Signs of excess; If they launch an equal weight Top-20 ETF, I'd consider buying it. The 15th to 20th company by mkt cap are all interesting names like Costco, JnJ, P&G, Visa, MasterCard, Walmart ; No, VOO is S&P500.; I’m not saying this etf has no point, I’m saying the title of the article is stupid af and misleading.; Concentrated investment.

Blackrock has another mouse trap; The point is for a vehicle that has the top 20 stocks by market cap.

If you’re why you would invest in this etf vs VOO that’s purely an opinion; Seems like the baby bear middlegroud option. Less risk than picking individual stocks, more mag 7 juice than VOO; Single stocks are risky, the point of an ETF is to minimize risk, hence the desire to exclude meme stocks like TSLA; What, “same shit, different day?’; Walmart is #14 in market cap. Where did you get 22?; Check out VASGX lol; Avantis already does this lol; A Russel-like 2000 where it is the smallest 2000 of the largest 3000 ETFs, just to be confusing. ; If you want 19 individual stocks and you don’t want the 20th in that category you’re basically stock picking. With fractional shares it’s easy enough to buy 19 individual stocks.; Ah ok so here’s what you’re missing.  Look at the S&P500/VOO/IVV and Total Stock Market/VTI and you will also notice that Walmart is not ranked #16 —- Why?  Because the indexes weigh stocks by *free float* adjusted market cap.  

A stock could have $25B total market cap but its free float market cap could be say $18B - the latter is the real size of the company based on public float shares - that’s what indexes are basing the size on.  

In a nutshell they’re not including private shares - they’re just counting publicly tradable shares.

An equal-weight ETF would hold the same **dollar amount** for each individual holding regardless of how many shares or partial shares that dollar amount represents. If it did that then yes, every company would represent 5% of a 20 company ETF.; Right so this is uncommon and those types of ETFs like RSP rebalance every month.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

TTM OCF increased 57% vs the TTM figure 1 year ago, and TTM FCF +122%. 19% growth in the real money maker AWS.

10-year broke the longstanding 4.35% resistance level and sits at almost 4.39%.; Amazon made its attempt at $200. I'm sure it'll fall back below $190 over the next few days.; After reworking calculations based on recent reports, spurred by reestablished operations at one of their highest-grade mines, Wesdome Gold's current and forward statistics have been revised. 

* FY2024 ROA 17.6% → 20.1% and FY2025 26.4% → 31.7%. 
* FY2024 EPS increased from $0.70 to $0.80. FY2025 EPS is projected at $1.29 instead of $1.06. This lowers current P/E from 15.7 to 12.3. 

Now it’s arguably a top-tier pick in the gold miner hierarchy.; [deleted]; From X, since I can't post a link, and I'm too lazy at this hour to post my own words on the subject:

""After reading the report, I saw what happened to $HWKN this year: it’s mainly due to SG&A expenses, which significantly increased from $3.8M since last Q2 due to the acquisition of a business. Without that increase, EPS growth would have been 14% instead of 5%.

Last fiscal year, $HWKN spent $5.8M on SG&A due to acquisitions, and this year, in just two quarters, it has already spent $7.2M. This is something to keep an eye on, as last year they spent more on acquisitions ($90M) than they have in these two quarters ($30M)""

Basically, EPS suffered because they invested in some large acquisitions. Since they have a good history of bolting on their acquisitions, I'm totally fine with this.; ECG is a new spinoff as of today. The company was spun out of MDU and is their electric construction/repair division.

If stocks and gold are continuing to put in ATH's, US Treasuries are starting to look very appealing.; As I pour through the projected financials, the geological substrate data, and drill results across all projects, I’m becoming unbearably bullish over my #1 junior mining stock. 

The company has everything you want: no debt, low AISC, finalized capex budget, FX arbitrage, high-grade ore for both open pit and underground, permit and acquisition costs at a fraction of net profit. Yet it is being priced as an exploration company with no significant discoveries when it currently produces a higher 1-year FCF than its entire enterprise value, and this will continue for the next 4 years minimum.

At a current P/E of 2x, it would need a 400% gain just to hit double digits and 700% to reach the median junior miner ratio. That would ignore it has a 2024 ROA of ~200% that will go up to ~600% next year once their debt covenant is fully paid at the end of Q4 2024 and the open pit reaches the second layer of higher-grade ore.; TOI.V (TOITF) earnings:

Expectations. INTC expectations are to the point where the bar is easier to step over because it's practically on the floor. The ""AMD could catch up to NVDA"" trade that people seemed to have for a while ended earlier this year, but I think people still expect more than they're giving quarter after quarter. AI is the biggest theme and the last bunch of AMD quarters have been ""good, but..."" or ""okay.""; I want to be clear this is not about me defending intel in anyway, just explaining what sometimes causes the movements you’re describing. Expectations for intel were already rock bottom before earnings and the stock is down over 50% YTD consequently. So the actual surprise from earnings was the guidance. Now will that come to fruition?

How many people's investment playbook is basically ""mag 7""?

The media should have criticized him more for that. ; If they actually have an earnings call next Tuesday afternoon I'm sure that will be entertaining.; Nope; Why did they tank?; People have been saying this about INTC and SEDG for about a year now. If you have skin in the game then I hope you are correct, but otherwise consider moving on.; 2.8M market cap lmao. Could buy a board seat.; You know it was all fraud but you'd still put your money on it? ok big dawg.; What happened to them; Probably won't break it until Bezos stops selling at $200. It has made a run at it several times but immediately sells back off.; Yah aws is legit 100b high margin business; It's not disclosed in full detail, but on the earnings call:

> The majority of that spending will support the growing need for technology infrastructure, primarily relating to the cloud-computing platform Amazon Web Services, as the company puts money into meeting demand for artificial-intelligence services, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on the earnings call Thursday.

And from Jassy:

> The jump in spending is primarily being driven by generative AI investments, Jassy said

They have so many business lines alongside retail, like streaming, gen. AI hardware, AWS, that I don't think retail capex is as dominant anymore.; Q4 2021 is also not a fair comparison, more fair comparison would probably be q4 2021 to q4 2024 which is still TBD.

But just for funsies, I looked at the numbers. EPS was 1.53 that quarter so EPS is +40% since then... GOOG was at $145ish after that earnings report.. so earnings growth has far outpaced share price growth, and this trend will most likely continue until GOOG has a single digit P/E. For reasons I can't quite understand, tbh.; What’s your point? The company underlying has grown too as showed by the last ER. P/E is still too low for a hyperscaler like Google; It has become more difficult to project now, as the easier returns have been made.


The way I'd reason to future market cap is to first guess some future earnings trajectory, and then guess some future multiple that markets might place on those earnings. Let's choose 5 years from now, as I think any investment that you can't see at least a 5 year runway on is not worth thinking about.


Imo, earnings easily double from here on continued hardware alone. And then we will see more come in from service revenues that have barely turned on, which will be even more margin accretive than the hardware business.


But what multiple will the markets bestow? This is very hard. If we assume average multiples don't change (that is, indices in 5 years have a similar average p/e as we see now), we can at least remove baseline effects. 


A conservative estimate is 2x today's market cap in 5 years. On average, S&P doubles every 7 years, so this is only slightly more aggressive than average market returns. No matter what, we are very likely to see 6-7T companies after 5 years if average returns remain average, so the question is who is it gonna be, and I see NVDA as an easy member of that list.


Plus or minus another doubling, which is to say I find it extremely likely that NVDA market cap in 5 years is between here and 4x here, with a breach on either side representing a significant divergence from my expectations.



Given the uncertainty in continued ML advances from top researchers in the field, no one should hold incredibly strong views on what will or won't be possible by then. Although nearly none of them think they won't get better at all, and to find out what's possible they need to continue ramping compute, so I think it is incredibly safe to expect returns to be on the positive side of 0%.


Additional colour: Considering the dollar size of manual labour markets, if someone solves robots on Issac platform (with every leading robotics firm already happy users), the earnings potential is tremendous. NIMs are likely to drive larger earnings than the hardware business in time. Also all the omniverse/digital twin stuff.; I mean yeah it's pretty obvious what's going on. Sucks for the rest of us; We already have a few times and keep selling off when it hits $200.00.; Was looking for 40 personally; First, I'm kinda surprised so many people in these threads are into offshore stuff.

To add to the discussion, consider [the construction of new rigs](https://i.imgur.com/Z4dk64S.jpeg).  There was massive overbuild in the 2010s that caused a huge bust. There has since been [major consolidation/reduction in fleet sizes](https://i.imgur.com/s9eJOKY.jpeg), though granted there has been rising efficiencies. Some of the names here are highly leveraged though so I'm avoiding them. 

In coal in the US, there was also a huge bust in mostly thermal names as US shale + solar / wind + regulatory intervention killed the industry. So over the course of a few years, companies went bust, their assets got bought up/consolidated, and now you have a few big players. Overall leverage is much much lower in these names today, and many are literally swimming in cash, making bankruptcy basically out of the question. Bankruptcy is a good thing for these industries during busts to reduce excess capacity and weed out the bad management.

Nobody (sane) is that bullish on US thermal coal, if they buy thermal coal names it is probably for exposure to Asian or other markets. The margins Peabody get on its US thermal coal is like $1 per ton, versus say $100 for its met / thermal coal abroad (haven't checked the actual numbers, but the order of magnitude is roughly correct). Which is pretty insane--they're both the same kinda rock more or less.; That was a special circumstance brought about by the shale revolution. Many, many E&P oil companies and tankers got crushed when they made enormous capex budgets expecting oil to stay above $100. Roughly half of the mid-tier drillers went bankrupt between 2014 and 2018.  

The future is going to be more akin to the early 2000s. Companies right now are too complacent and unwilling to invest anything in assets, expecting oil to revert back to the $50-60 range.; Right now, the price movement is still unattractive. TDW hasn't found a floor: today, it broke the $60 support level from early January and is still trending below all its MAs. If it can bounce back next week and settle above, I'll consider buying in.; Doesn’t matter. It will break 200 eventually and then keep going up.

I would rather use something like p/ocf instead due to the insane capex amzn is dumping into various projects. On a price to operating cash flow basis its actually quite cheap vs itself historically, being close to WMT price/ocf atm; Good luck cuz that's never happening.; Link broken?; Will break through when he's done selling. It's a massive wall.; It's a micro-cap that will get your post deleted if one says the name.; I mentioned their primary mine to someone else below.; * The gold price has risen 35% since the beginning of the year without a commensurate increase in operating costs. Most gold miners had their margins pressured by rising AISC through H1 2024, but this one has seen AISC estimates fall to $800-900 from $1000-1100. 
* Once they pay off their debt covenant in full at the end of Q4, net profit per quarter will automatically increase 20-25%.
* It has one of the highest ore grades for an open pit in the world. Standard estimates find 0.3-0.5 g/T Au is the cutoff point where operations become economically feasible. This company has an average of 4.05 g/T Au, with the geological layers offering higher concentrations once mining crews get deeper. 2 years in, they've just reached the edge of those more profitable layers while mining deposits with 3.3 or lower.  
* Besides a few exceptions like Jaguar and Galiano, most juniors have not attracted investor inflows so far. The GDXJ/gold ratio is still hovering around all-time lows.

They should do buybacks in the future to reverse the share dilution from earlier in the decade. The valuations are certainly cheap enough to be accretive. Fortunately, the company is not like Coeur Mining - it doesn't need to create more shares for funding purposes. Management is using the FCF to secure interests in other promising sites, seeking to grow into a mid-tier West African producer.; Like all gold stocks, I only consider holding this when the base commodity has bottomed out or when it's on a secular bull cycle.

The flagship Segilola open pit will be exhausted by 2028, but it can be extended to 2031-2033 if all the satellite assays are mined and the underground quartz-pegamatite veins are excavated. During that period the company seeks to open the second, larger Douta mine in Senegal; it just recently purchased 100% interest in the Guitry exploration project from Endeavour Mining, located in Cote D'Ivoire. The angle is to get in early before all three projects are simultaneously running, then have the market rerate the company's value as gold continues to rise. As the company enjoys such a high ROA and IRR from Segilola, they can use their FCF towards expansion instead of debt servicing and depreciation costs.

I don't have a price target right now. I'm waiting for completed drilling samples and geochemical analysis on the Guitry project. That will give a rough idea of what kind of deposits are in the area, which would allow a preliminary NAV calculation of the entire company.; What a weirdly delayed, rude, and remarkably unhelpful comment.

I look at it this way. Right now, with massive capex into several different projects, they are demonstrating strong FCF generation. In 3 years, the gen AI portion of those investments are either a waste or have a high ROI. The end of that capex will boost FCF even more either way, though it not being a waste will be a huge bonus. But if the business is able to thrive today anyway, that tells me it isn't necessary that the ROI is great to still buy a good business at a decent price.

I think AMZN has more moats to it than say META, so for META it's massive R&D capex is a bit more critical to sustaining a future for the business beyond just ads. AMZN on the other hand is a leader in many places, so even if gen AI or whatever is a bust, it's still the leader in cloud, retail, and challenging others in streaming, advertising, payments, etc. No need for chatbots to excel.

They keep attaching the phrase gen AI everywhere, but to me it still sounds like they are spending a lot of money into improving AWS, which is a proven money maker.; ☝️; It wasn't a black swan occurrence. The long-term oscillations in commodity cycles are predictable because every subsector follows the same general pattern.

* Commodity prices are bad. Companies can't get financing. Nobody wants to spend FCF when returns are so bleak. Therefore, capex is slim.
* Prices start to go up when the current sources peak and begin to roll over, or when exogenous demand begins to increase spot prices.
* Everyone waits for confirmation that prices will stay high. It takes years to decades to establish mines or offshore drilling platforms, so no one wants to pony up the capital only to find out the investment was dead weight. Alternatively, new projects are opened except the lag time means it has no impact on current supply.
* Prices remain stable/increase over the next few years. Both companies and outside investors become optimistic. They switch from apprehensive to accommodative and begin to invest in the sector.
* Euphoria. Prices are at an all-time high; companies are raking in the dough. They willingly take on debt for M&As + new projects.
* Prices crash from oversupply. The companies that spend too much fold or take severe hits.
  
The problem is it's easy to be a contrarian investor and impossible to be a contrarian operator. In such capital-intensive, slow supply side industries, companies are always lagging behind and never in position to capitalize off trends.

I also urge you to watch Trump's dueling north carolina speech done the day before. The difference is night and day, seriously. This is without getting into all the reasons Trump's economic policy will be disastrous if enacted.  20% tariff on all imports (60% on all chinese imports rather than targeted like Biden's) and the President taking direct authority over the Federal Reserve's monetary policymaking will lead to a big D- Depression.

I did some conservative back-of-the-envelope calculations (NPV of gold reserves at pessimistic gold prices) and I arrive at about 2x of the current price. Do you know where this big valuation gap comes from? Do they have a history of being less than truthful? Does Nigeria warrant such a big discount?

Like this seems a bit too good to be true :); Understood thanks a lot for the detailed responses.

Do you have any advice or tips on how to get more into the analysis like you did on this company or just general resources you used to become a better investor (books, newspapers, etc)?; Going bankrupt is the end part. It all boils down to greed: as management, how do you retain discipline when the future looks so amazing? As an investor, you want to identify the companies that understand this and expand operations during the initial part of the upswing.

Alternatively, determining exit strategies is no different than in any other bubble.

Are you accounting for the 1.78 million indicated + inferred ounces at the Douta project, as well as the underground reserves + satellite deposits at Segilola?

> Do you know where this big valuation gap comes from?

A combination of market cap size, location, lack of interest in the junior mining sector, and inaccurate financial reporting. 

> Does Nigeria warrant such a big discount?

Companies operating in West Africa are generally treated as a discount due to geopolitical risk. One of the main reasons I'm not overly worried in Nigeria's case is that the federal government has bent over backwards to court outside investment in the mining sector. If this company suffers from interference, it will dampen any enthusiasm from American or Canadian capital as Segilola is the first official mine.  

> Or is it maybe because they haven't returned anything to shareholders yet (history of diluation to finance initial mine I assume) so market is skeptical?

Correct. The CEO has implied they will start buybacks in H1 of next year. Their P/E is so low and net income so high relative to enterprise value, it's one of the best ways they can deploy their cash. However, I'd prefer limited cash allocation in this direction with the main focus remaining on the Douta PFS and Guitry exploration.; For investing or the mining sector specifically?; I have assumed that they can still get gold out of Segilola for the next 3 years. Further assuming an ACIC of $1000 (conservative) and a realized gold price of $2200 (hopefully conservative) and they dig out 80koz/y that gives us a cash flow of ~$100m/y (80000oz/y * $1200/oz). Now I just discount that cash flow by 10% per year for three years, which gives me $306m. Everything else I consider optionalities with value of $0 (again because I have no clue). Anyway, $306m is already more than twice today's market cap.

I saw this report here https://x.com/Smudgedann/status/1843559214041706864 where Hannam & Partners puts C$332m ($237m) on Segilola and C$82m ($58m) on the exploration assets for a total of ~$300m.

They seem to be even more conservative than me or I miscaculated something or I just didn't risk weight things properly. Do you mind sharing your numbers/valuation?; Also the tax issue seems to me more severe than I thought. It seems to be me that Osun state managed to expropriate 5% of the Segilola project according to their government website https://www.osunstate.gov.ng/2024/10/osun-thors-dispute-governor-adeleke-to-get-osun-shares-and-segilola-to-pay-taxes/

Radio silence from Thor Explorations about this issue so far.; Investing. I’m trying to get more into it and become more detailed but don’t know where to start.; >I have assumed that they can still get gold out of Segilola for the next 3 years. Further assuming an ASIC of $1000 (conservative) and a realized gold price of $2200 (hopefully conservative) and they dig out 80koz/y that gives us a cash flow of \~$100m/y (80000oz/y \* $1200/oz).

Anyway, $306m is already more than twice today's market cap.

The ASIC estimate is fine and quite low compared to most large gold companies besides Agnico. I do think 10% discount rate is a little high, although it's standard to assume 10% to formulate a margin of safety. The production levels in your DCF are a little too low. They produced 98k in 2022 and 85k in 2023. The early part of 2024 was hampered by lower recovery rates due to issues at the processing plant; those were fixed. 85-90k would be a fair estimate until the end of mine life. The company believe it will produce 100-105k ounces per year from 2024 onwards.

The gold price...eh...not sure. I'm tempted to say you have to raise it simply because gold rarely retraces when it's shooting up at the rate we're witnessing. It can consolidate or crash after a run-up, but what we're seeing right now is a fundamental change in structural incentives. Gold is reasserting its old role as a store of value and a neutral reserve asset; therefore, international demand will continue to apply upward pressure on price.

>I saw this report here [https://x.com/Smudgedann/status/1843559214041706864](https://x.com/Smudgedann/status/1843559214041706864) where Hannam & Partners puts C$332m ($237m) on Segilola and C$82m ($58m) on the exploration assets for a total of \~$300m.

The problem is that they're using faulty financial statements and a naive structural model. I don't blame them for arriving at these conclusions, but GIGO is sadly a feature of financial analysis.

* Their conclusion ignores that the company is already vastly underpriced. At the current share price of $0.20, it would require a ROA of 17.2% and an EPS of $0.03 to justify what the market is pricing in. Their true estimated ROA in 2024 is 198.4% and EPS is $0.12. Hannam & Partners is assuming the market has already determined its current fair value and extrapolating from there. It's a classic sign of amateur market analysis. First you have to determine whether the embedded expectations make sense.
* Their calculation of AISC for Q3 ignores the optionality of running their stockpile ore through the mill. Management did this in Q1 and Q2 to run down their gold-in-circuit, which lowered their AISC costs to $800-900. If they decided to continue operations through the heavy rains in September, that would substantially raise AISC and negatively affect gross margins and OCF.
* Segilola has never been closed out to depth. It was originally designed to operate profitably at a gold price of $1600, so management never invested in deep exploration below the pit to delineate the full extent of the higher-grade ore. The underground reserves, both inferred and implied, are estimated at 141k for all regions above 2.5 g/t Au. I believe this is on the low end and the true deposits are considerably bigger. Part of this underground deposit can be accessed simply by extending the pit downwards.
* In general, you can't evaluate a gold miner's market worth based on P/NAV or NPV according to a straightforward DCF model. You have to evaluate how efficiently the gold is being extracted, how much of the company's FCF is directed into R&D and expansion instead of asset maintenance and debt servicing, what grade levels the operation is currently reaching, etc. You're not just assessing the value of the gold, but whether the company can capitalize on that value and benefit from it. 

The company released its Q3 operation update two weeks after that Twitter post. They're beaten most of H&P's estimates exactly in the ways I listed out.

>They seem to be even more conservative than me or I miscalculated something or I just didn't risk weight things properly. Do you mind sharing your numbers/valuation?

Your calculations are fine. The company has slightly different estimates on their website, and the CEO claimed back in May they will have cumulative free cash flow over $350 million after taxes (at that point gold was around \~$2250). Their website projections were rangebound with a ceiling of $2000, and since gold prices affect cash flow and IRR linearly, we can easily extrapolate.; |Gold Price|Cash Flow|NPV (5% discount)|IRR|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1400|$272m|$225m|63%|
|1600|$372m|$310m|85%|
|1800|$473m|$404m|107%|
|2000|$575m|$494m|130%|
|2200|$676m|$582m|152%|
|2400|$776m|$668m|174%|
|2600|$877m|$757m|197%|
|2800|$978m|$845m|219%|

These are the company's calculations. They are not exact: there seems to be something extra incorporated in their 1400-2000 range that drags the NPV down. It declines at a steady rate as the gold price goes up, so I tried to account for it.

> Everything else I consider optionalities with value of $0 (again because I have no clue).

You're right. Technically they should count as R&D and be categorized under investments.; That's the same report you sent me before. 

They got a written certificate equivalent to 5% of the share value Tropical Mines Ltd received. That was 103,857,388 shares back when the company acquired 100% ownership of SROL, 40.68% of their total share volume. 5% of that is barely above 2% of total shares. 

Even if tax assessment of 3.25 billion naira is found valid and paid in full, that only equates to $1,966,250. That's less than half of what the company pays every quarter to their senior debt facilitator, Africa Finance Corp.; Some of this information is not publicly available and hard to access, so I don't know if I can offer useful advice. 

I'd say the first step is to avoid data and look at companies through a general lens. The former will be too overwhelming if you don't have a natural affinity for it. Instead, you should think about it in qualitative terms. What does this company's business model, its customer base, its products, its industry sector, its competition, its size, its plans for the future? All of these can be understood comparatively or in simple terms. Then translate concepts like free cash flow, ROA, debt, accounts payable, etc. within the same scope. Once you get a handle on their significance, you'll start to instinctively grasp whether the numbers you see are good or bad. 

As for resources, I use a lot of sources for information on the micro and macro level. For beginners, *The Elements of Investing* and *A Beginning's Guide to the Stock Market* are excellent introductions.; Thanks for the detailed reply! You gave me a couple more things to look at, especially the possible extensions of the Segilola mine and gold price dynamics (I've never been much of a fan of holding gold myself but don't have a problem selling to others ;)

Really seems like the market is getting this one wrong. Even with pessimistic numbers and ignoring all optionalities this seem undervalued by a lot.

Regarding your calculation of RoA do you just count PPE as part of assets for the purpose of your calculation or am I somehow doing this wrong? Total assets seem to be at ~C$370m ($265m).

Also I've been looking at other gold miners you have posted but It really seems like this one has one of the better risk/reward ratios. Do you think this a fair assessment?; Neat thanks for the data. This really makes the safety margin look ridiculously large.; Thanks, last question lol. If it’s not publicly available how do you have access?"
"The S&P 500 And The Nasdaq Composite With Losses Of 1.9% and 2.8%, respectively,Could Be Headed For A Small Correction.","The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were in a free fall today losing 1.9% and 2.8% respectively, - a rout as traders and investors turned their noses up at Meta and Microsoft’s earnings. Even Google has given up its 5% gain from yesterday. Matching the drop, the VIX closed at 23.16, and the 10-year Treasury Yield closed about the same at 4.29%. 

Should Apple and Amazon disappoint post-market today, I think a correction could be on. The main bullish factor countering a volatile election week, a VIX over 23 and high yields of 4.3% is strong earnings, especially from the M-7. Clearly, that doesn’t seem to be happening.

Meta  - Initially, it seemed like a perfunctory one percent drop on a small beat and in-line guidance, but it’s gone a lot further as Meta is down 4% to 570.

**Why the rout?** Analysts and investors panned high Capex plans of $40Bn and costly high-risk bets such as Meta’s Reality Labs unit, (the developer of augmented and virtual reality technologies), which logged a staggering operating loss of $4.4 billion 

Microsoft - (down 6% to $408) is getting clobbered for a different reason. Even as Azure grew 34%, the pace wasn’t enough, and guidance of 31% to 32% in constant currency was lower than expected. However, this is due to supply chain constraints as President Amy Hood noted that the 1 or 2-point deceleration Microsoft has guided is mainly due to some supply pushouts, in terms of AI supply coming online that the company counted on. (Read, not as many Blackwells/Hoppers as they would have liked)

""We expect consumption growth to be stable compared to Q1, and we expect to add more sequential dollars to Azure than any other quarter in history,"" Hood added.

The indomitable Dan Ives of Wedbush remains as bullish as ever…

""We actually disagree with this initial take as the new Azure reporting standards have moved Street numbers all around and a slight deceleration is totally expected by many investors with some supply constraints and reacceleration in 2H25, and we would be strong buyers of MSFT on any weakness this morning,"" Wedbush analysts, led by Daniel Ives, said in a note.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ggp3pm/the_sp_500_and_the_nasdaq_composite_with_losses/,0,"Man one bad day and the bears are declaring the next recession; Didn't we have a correction in August? Nasdaq never hit ATH and we're due another correction; Also could not; ATH tomorow confirmed.; Or maybe because the NASDAQ grew by \~10% in two months.; I'm expecting another leg down due to Iran attack over the weekend and likely chaos from Trump's plans to claim elections stolen again plus overall uncertainty around the election and the impending fomc meeting the next day. After that it's probably going to be a really good end of year. I'm guessing another 2-3% drawdown for the indices is nothing major.; Very possible this winds up being a terrible take since it leans towards what many expect, but the problem with thinking that something might be really cooking is that the election is in a few days.

I'm pretty sure we need to see volatility get crushed first as the election passes before we discuss anything else and that vol crush is going to push the market up.; A correction is far from calling for a recession.  A smaller draw down than a correction seems more probable than a major selloff; These are definitely bots for sure; Not saying it will happen, but considering the valuations of some companies that make up 40% of Nasdaq, it wouldn’t come as a shock if it traded sideways for the next 5 years; I don't see volatility crush being our savior.

Really, unless the SMCI stuff turns disastrous, the bill might not come due on semiconductor stocks acting odd as a group until we flip the page to 2025 because of EoY flows getting in the way.; > Nah, there absolutely is something here in what I’m saying because the S&P floated higher on essentially nothing but vol crush for a couple weeks earlier in the month of October.

Yes, the market moves up when volatility is declining, and post-earnings IV crush is a proven phenomenon. But volatility usually stays elevated for a couple of months after election results, especially in the first 10-14 days.

> I’m telling you, some of what the VIX has done has to be worked off first before we get down to any kind of other business, there’s no choice unless something surprising occurs.

You're being vague. Are we talking about needing the VIX to decline for the indices to break out of their consolidation patterns? Or the opposite?

> Really, unless the SMCI stuff turns disastrous, the bill might not come due on semiconductor stocks acting odd as a group until we flip the page to 2025 because of EoY flows getting in the way.

EoY flows should be positive from late November onwards, but if the market turns dour the day after the election it's going to be a rough couple of weeks. Holistically, the market internals have been telegraphing this for a couple of months. It's just a matter of what the catalyst will be. Anything can serve as an excuse for protracted selling."
"Apple Q4 FY24 Earnings: Meets Targets, Record Install Base, Slight Misses on Services, China","Apple Earnings: https://investor.apple.com/investor-relations/default.aspx

CUPERTINO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple® today announced financial results for its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter ended September 28, 2024. The Company posted quarterly revenue of $94.9 billion, up 6 percent year over year, and quarterly diluted earnings per share of $0.97. Diluted earnings per share was $1.64,1 up 12 percent year over year when excluding the one-time charge recognized during the fourth quarter of 2024 related to the impact of the reversal of the European General Court’s State Aid decision.

“Today Apple is reporting a new September quarter revenue record of $94.9 billion, up 6 percent from a year ago,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “During the quarter, we were excited to announce our best products yet, with the all-new iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, AirPods 4, and remarkable features for hearing health and sleep apnea detection. And this week, we released our first set of features for Apple Intelligence, which sets a new standard for privacy in AI and supercharges our lineup heading into the holiday season.”

“Our record business performance during the September quarter drove nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow, allowing us to return over $29 billion to our shareholders,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO. “We are very pleased that our active installed base of devices reached a new all-time high across all products and all geographic segments, thanks to our high levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty.”

Apple’s board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of the Company’s common stock. The dividend is payable on November 14, 2024 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 11, 2024.

Apple will provide live streaming of its Q4 2024 financial results conference call beginning at 2:00 p.m. PT on October 31, 2024 at apple.com/investor/earnings-call.

I think it sinks.; Tim Ai; Apple benefits from the darling of Wall Street status, it hasn’t the growth the market expects from it yet it’s still valued like a mega growth company. Just looking at meta and Google that are trading at lower P/E with bigger growth rates and they both do buybacks as well; OVERPRICED 

But I ain't shorting; What is amazing is the fact Apple made about half what Google made this quarter, $15B versus $29B for Google.

Yet Apple has a PE that is about 50% higher than Google.  It will be even more after factoring in the current quarter.; Non AI technology mega cap; What a dud. Been saying it for a long time now, how no one see's the writing on the wall to me is just absurd.; Yikes, rest all missed but only iPhone beats?; FAANG will remain flat or down the next few years. Need to invest in new FAANG stocks; Services miss is concerning because it's been slowing down for a while; As a shareholder since 2006, I agree. Thank you Tim for making me wealthy.; You think it will keep on rising?; Apple is not priced for growth. Look at the analysts estimates. Apple is priced for returns and quality. EPS is where analysts focus on, with major stress on expenses since its mature business.  On every earnings call, they hammer on R&D and Infrastructure, and Services, not the top line.  

NO one cares or expects a company with 390B in revenues and 100B in FCF to grow at double digits except the average reddit degen who doesn’t understand how numbers work besides 3/4 KPIs.

Buybacks + Dividends = circled returns + stock movement = total returns. 

Either you think this is expensive or not; its subjective to your own view unless you have a crystal ball that tells you how much a stock price will move; if that is the case, we all should be working for you. Otherwise, value is relative to the buyer aka the market; The gross margins still insane; Initial after-hours market reaction is to drop a bit.; the services miss doesn't bode great either; Maybe right after the earnings but on the long term it ""can‘t“ sink because of the massive buybacks; They need Jobs back to come up with the next big thing. Cook is a very good operations guy but plays it too safe in my opinion.; Taim; Never tell them your next move; To be fair, Apple had to make a one time 14 billion dollar tax payment in the EU. Without that tax payment they would have made a similar profit.; [deleted]; Apple intelligence?; Service was the big letdown; [deleted]; They would very quickly fill into their valuation if they tightened up Capex. Everyone wants to be an investor but no one knows what it takes to be one. Amazon is investing heavily into AWS and and other bets for example; Won’t it drop off a cliff now since the most of that was the money google paid to them which they now have to stop; It’s an everything miss except for iPhones… Apple is stumbling and is about to trip and fall on its face.; lucky fuck; Probably not, the stock is very pricey. I am more of a fan of Google right now than the rest of the big tech companies. However Apple has a moat, huge brand, and it makes mountains of cash so they got that going for them.; 35 PE is priced for growth. If you DONT think a 35 PE is priced for growth, then you don't understand valuations.; 33 FWD PE is priced for growth; Whats the point in holding apple long term from here if your not looking for growth?

If the Apple cult stops culting what happens to the valuation then?; [removed]; > it's subjective to your own view

Yes, which is what we are discussing here. If we just say ""value is relative to the market"" and no other perspective is valued then why do we even have this subreddit?; What does ""priced for returns and quality"" even mean? Cash is cash. They definitely are a high quality company, but that can justify only so much of a premium. At 3.4T market cap and around 100B in profits, they are very clearly priced for growth. Growth that has not occurred for the past 4 years. At this point, you mighty as well buy US treasuries as they are also high quality and have a higher yield.; Business is not the problem, it’s the valuation; Jobs’s tenure was during a time where tech was exponentially improving so it’s easy to say that he was “innovative”. You idiots just don’t understand that consumer tech has matured and plateaued for almost a decade now. Why do you think all tech companies are now rushing to adopt AI as the new gold mine.; Jobs passed away years ago so thats not an option. I don’t get the complaints of Tim Apple either. He has been in charge of the company for over a decade and the company has done exceptionally well under him.; Thanks!  Knew something was a miss.; Didn't they already provision it?; Google and Microsoft is the only company seeing tangible indirect revenue from Ai besides NVDA; Run on OpenAI?; You misspelled Tesla.; But AAPL has grown and is growing.

I'm going off a stock screener here

AAPL revenue growth past 5 years: 10.97%

AAPL EPS p.a. growth past 5 years: 15.55%

AAPL EPS growth next 5 years: 9.29%

Their $1.64 EPS (excluding one-off EU tax) represents 12% growth YoY.

Using 6.75 TTM EPS gives AAPL a PE ratio of 33.

If AAPL grows that EPS by 9.29% per year for 5 years, then that's 10.5 EPS for 21 PE.

So yeah AAPL is priced for growth because they're growing.; lets not make this personal, it's rather simple really 

forward PE of 30 (assumes $7.50 in earnings for 2025) is maybe just a tad stretched 

but let's not forget what Buffett has always taught us: 

""it's much better to buy a great business at a fair price, than it is to buy a fair business at a great price""

Visa and Mastercard (and others) have enjoyed similar multiples for the past decade, and the stocks have performed exceptionally 

if Apple is transitioning into a services company before our very eyes (services grew at 12% YoY with a total disaster in China) then maybe 28, 29, 30x fwd earnings isn't as expensive as you think; Look at costco, Wall street dosent give a fuck so long as they can pump it; No disrespect but your point is kind of clueless since you again stressing on revenue growth, which analysts ain’t expecting to grow. Priced for growth is an ancient term for companies trading at a multiple above the average. The S&P as a total, is concentrated, but trading at around 27-30x depending on the day. Apple is trading at above that, but not significantly.

Returns come in many forms. Either you think it’s expensive or not based on the projected returns, that is different story. 

No one expecting the top line of apple to grow significantly. No one with a brain to be particular; > If the Apple cult stops culting what happens to the valuation then?

I see two options here


1. There's not actually a cult 

2. It becomes a religion


I can't help but feel like those that call it a cult aren't willing to accept that the company just makes excellent products.; What is your point? If revenues expected to grow forever, the price of the business would be infinite. 

As I said, you get returns by buybacks and dividends + appreciation, which is the tricky part since no one knows which way the stock will go.

The advantage of mature businesses is the stability of their earnings. Low Beta, and easier to project the cash coming and out especially when they have high margin


Not gonna argue on AI and innovation since these are the same buzzwords everyone using without understanding; If customers stop being customers for any business then the business suffers. What does your jealousy and anger towards Apple customers have to do with anything?; Aapl applying all their capital to buy back their own EXTREMELY overvalued shares is such a garbage use of capital. And yet the market keeps rewarding them for such a terrible capital allocation. It's fucking bonkers.

Once valuations come back to some sane level, aapl better be punished greatly for buying their low growth turd stock at 35 PE; [removed]; Sure, that is about 3-3.3% yield vs the current yield of treasury of above 4.4% for short term; hence, my point on where the stock will go, which you seemed glanced over because it doesn’t fit your narrative or couldn’t comprehend reading 50 words in full.

Stocks are priced based on where the analysts are projecting them, no analyst is projecting Apple to grow double digits.; No, people will have the option to utilize ChatGPT for requests but it’s not a necessity.; No, it's not.  Apple's AI is mostly on-device models, some cloud-side models run by Apple, and then in some cases the user can opt-in to querying ChatGPT.

Apple is doing the smart thing here - cloud based gen AI execution is very expensive to run and there are very few use cases and users who are willing to pay more for the result than the query cost to execute.  Apple's plan is brilliant - it is leveraging hardware *it sold to users at a profit* to run AI models (when applicable) at *zero cost to Apple* and just a power (and battery life) cost to the user.  The on-device models won't be as good, but the hope is that they're good enough while also being the right price and cost.; Good joke....  Hold on, it's not a joke is it :-)

I just wish Leon wouldn't get so directly involved with the politiks.; >AAPL revenue growth past 5 years: 10.97%

10% over 5 years is good for a PE over 33 company now ?

LOL; Service revenue growth is slowing. 

You just literally also tried to argue it was a growing company while arguing with someone's that its not priced for growth.

Is APPLE priced for growth or value? if its growth why isn't it growing on pace with the likes of MSFT who is growing faster with a similar PE?; Visa and MasterCard are priced the way they are because they are delivering constant double digit revenue growth AND EPS growth. They are also benefiting from long tailwinds related to credit adoption away from cash still.

Apple was priced like a stable consumer tech company not too long ago, and their current earnings are not justifying their valuation. What happens when their valuation drops to something reasonable when they cannot continue growing EPS by more than high single digits? Their revenues are essentially flat YoY.; >if Apple is transitioning into **a services company** before our very eyes (services grew at 12% YoY with a total disaster in China)

Can't even beat lowball expectation

LOL; Works until it doesn't; That just means most stocks in the s&p are priced for growth.; > I can't help but feel like those that call it a cult aren't willing to accept that the company just makes excellent products.

We aren't talking about the price of an iPhone but of a stock here. The product might be great but if the stock doesn't produce more returns than the market, then it's not a good buy.

People too often confuse ""good company"" and ""good investment"". They arent the same.; A nit on what you said: growth forever does not mean infinite price. Every company has a growth and terminal phase accounted for in a DCF. These things do not spit out “infinite” as a price.; What's there to be jealous of from Apple customers?![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thinking_face_hmm); [deleted]; Oh so it's priced for growth now?


Weird. Seems you want to flip back and forth to fit your narrative.; They certainly can run on devices, but that also means it’s very limited. It’s more an automation tool than AI. But they don’t call it “AI”, so no misleading; it's per annum 

I think it's a reasonable and fair price to pay, 10% profit growth for the next 5 years for 33x, big moat with locked in customers; AAPL is spending the least on capex.

TTM figures (nearest billion)

AAPL 

Sales growth 2% (4% ex-China)

Operating cash flow $118B

Capex $9B

Share based compensation $12B

Free cash flow ex sbc = $97B

Additional information: Apple's hardware business is affected by the same cycle as other computer hardware businesses. 

Dell's server business sales increased 80% but consumer sales fell 22%.

HP's overall system sales increased 5% but consumer sales fell 1%.

In the above context, mac sales increasing just 2% is acceptable because outside of business AI spending, personal computers and devices are not booming right now.

MSFT.

Sales growth 16%

Operating cash flow $122B

Capex $49B

Share based compensation $11B

Free cash flow ex sbc = $62B

Therefore, AAPL has lower growth than MSFT but much higher free cash flow because they are spending much less on capex.

You might be thinking that capex can be reduced by MSFT but if we are going to reduce capex, how does that affect MSFT's growth rate?

We cannot separate capex from growth, because one affects the other.

If AAPL spends $50B on capex like MSFT, what would their growth be? If it's 16%, then they're roughly equivalent.; Bingo; No it doesn’t. Excess Money supply and inflation just mean that the money has to go somewhere. No better quality companies to buy than mag 7. Hence PE just expands.; Nah there are limitations.

Terminal value always assumes growth is less than whatever discount rate you are using.

If a company grows forever, i.e. growth rate equal or above discount rate, then the formula doesn't work because price approaches infinity as growth rate approaches discount rate.; Because they get to live rent free in your head.; No I'm not....; You literally proved my point. Apple is priced as if it’s growing yet it isn’t making Capex investments and is basicly riding on the hope of a new upgrade cycle and service revenue (which is now slowing). 

The fact MSFT could flip a switch a become far more profitable is a negative to Apple not a pro. 

Basicly Apple is valued as if it’s a growing company when the numbers actually show the opposite. They unlike MSFT cannot find ways to invest money into the business. That’s a sign of a business that isn’t growing.

Apple can’t spend 50B on capex because it literally wouldn’t be profitable. That shows they have run out of growth run way and are moving to efficiency based improvement. That’s value; Current earnings have the inflation “priced in” so pe ratio should remain unchanged all things being equal. Future inflation forecasts are down back to normal. I guess if there are still fears of inflation then that could cause asset valuations to inflate while demand for bonds decline. I’m not saying mag 7 is a bad investment or that the everything bubble will burst. I’m just saying from a book value perspective these companies are priced as if they are going to be growing quite a bit in the next decade. They could just keep going up though because at the end of the day an asset is worth whatever the next guy is willing to pay.; You have called the last 10 tops, meanwhile the SP is up 25%… must feel bad to loose money in this market.

The ER was great all around, but Apple almost always goes down after ER and then up a few days later.; [deleted]; It's not flipping a switch though.

We don't know how much of their capex is necessary to maintain their current services - it's expensive to run all the data centers. 

Then you don't know how much growth would disappear if they turned off all discretionary capex.

Assuming MSFT is running like any business would, they are not paying the capex if they are not going to get a return on their investment. 

In terms of Apple, growing top line by mid single digits and bottom line by 9-10% is fine.

$97B FCF versus $62B FCF. Their FCF is 56% higher than MSFT's so if MSFT's growth rate is 10% higher than AAPL's, it will take 5 years for them to reach parity. 

So the question is not ""apple is not growing versus msft is growing""

It's Apple grew EPS by 12% this quarter and MSFT grew EPS by 10% this quarter.

While Apple's top line growth is slower, they're tight on costs, allowing their bottom line to grow faster and Microsoft's top line growth is higher, but their costs are growing proportionally faster so their bottom line growth is lower.

It's basically your preference as an investor if you would like a company that focuses on reinvesting for growth or focuses on efficiency and payouts to shareholders.; Dude I'm over over 50% this year, amd literally just threw 30% of my account in EOSE at 3.04 this afternoon. 

I'm doing FINE lmao. And when SPY crashes, I'll make money on the short too. 

AAPL er wasn't great. Services missed. Gross margin missed. Their EPS growth is low teens and PE is 35.; I’m skeptical about healthcare being the next growth driver. The AirPods as hearing aids is brilliant, but is the healthcare device market big enough to grow earnings for a company that sells the most popular consumer device in the world?

They need products that 100 million people will buy, not 10 million. That’s a tall order for growth.; >It’s not flipping a switch though.

>We don’t know how much of their capex is necessary to maintain their current services - it’s expensive to run all the data centers.

This is a fallacy. Your making it two options either they can totally cut Capex to zero or keep it all. You and I both know the Capex required for maintaince is going to be orders of magnitude in difference. If MSFT wanted to they could substantially cut Capex and go total cash flow. If you won’t accept that there is zero reason in continuing the conversation. Listen to one earning call about Capex and you should understand how much money is being spent on projects that will not turn profitable for years. That’s not needed to maintain service.

> Then you don’t know how much growth would disappear if they turned off all discretionary capex.

Irrelevant. If MSFT was cutting Capex like that it wouldn’t be because they wanted to grow. It would be because they are accepting that growth will slow and a value model is best. Kinda like what apples doing.

> Assuming MSFT is running like any business would, they are not paying the capex if they are not going to get a return on their investment.

Yes absolutely which is why Apple isn’t doing Capex and MSFT is. Because one can get a return on that money, while the other is slowing and knows investing money into a business that isn’t growing is waste.

Almost like that’s why apple isn’t spending as much on Capex as MSFt. They don’t have a good investment.

> In terms of Apple, growing top line by mid single digits and bottom line by 9-10% is fine.

Yes which would be fine if it was a value company priced as such. It’s not. It’s a bit cheaper than MSFT which is growing revenue at 16% and cloud investments that are literally seeing triple digit growth.

> $97B FCF versus $62B FCF. Their FCF is 56% higher than MSFT’s so if MSFT’s growth rate is 10% higher than AAPL’s, it will take 5 years for them to reach parity.

Yes thank you for explaining that one is a growing business with many opportunities to make money back on Capex while the other is a slowing business that does not have many opportunities to make money back on Capex. You just explain the difference between value and growth.

> So the question is not “apple is not growing versus msft is growing”

> It’s Apple grew EPS by 12% this quarter and MSFT grew EPS by 10% this quarter.

Auto zone grows its EPS every quarter, it’s not growing. The fact you don’t get it is astounding. Auto one is a good company, but it’s a value play. You buy it because it won’t grow but you’re buying $1 for .90 cents. EPS growth shows your section if the pie, not how big the pie is.; And yet they still beat, those misses were tiny, and in other important ares they beat like IPhone sales. You make it sound like massive growth was expected, but it was not. They beat estimates.
It sounds like you don’t really know how to value a company like Apple.; Autozone is growing? I see consistent top line growth and double digit bottom line growth.

You don't know what growing means.

Single digit growth is growing.

Double digit growth is growing.

AAPL trades at 35x FCF

MSFT trades at 49X FCF

So yes the double digit growth stock is trading at a higher multiple.

If you want to argue what is growth and not then should I just bring in NVDA and say MSFT is not growing because it's not triple digits."
Alphabet Deserves A Better Valuation,"**I had recommended Alphabet (GOOG)** [**as a great long-term buy at $150**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1anr3id/alphabet_goog_150_looks_like_an_excellent_long/), several months ago.

Last evening, Google knocked it out of the park with really stellar results. I bought more shares this morning, and am reiterating a Buy.

I believe analysts’ consensus earnings could be a little conservative and Google should continue to beat estimates with better growth and operating margins.

Google's earnings quality is better than several tech giants for the following reasons.

* It has a near monopoly in Search
* Market leadership in media with YouTube.
* A strong first-mover advantage with Waymo.
* A fast-growing Google Cloud business, third only to and catching up with Azure and AWS.

**Its earnings and growth are sustainable, thus it deserves a better valuation and multiple.**

Let's take a closer look at Q3 earnings.

Q3 GAAP EPS came in at $2.12 per share, beating expectations of $1.85 per share $0.27, or 14% - **This was a substantial beat.**

Revenue of $88.3Bn (+14.9% Y/Y) beat by $2.05B or 3%.

Consolidated Alphabet revenues in Q3 2024 increased 15%, or 16% in constant currency, YoY to $88.3Bn reflecting strong momentum across the business.

Google Services revenues increased 13% to $76.5 billion, led by strength across Google Search & other, Google subscriptions, platforms, and YouTube ads.

**Total operating income increased 34% and operating margin percent jumped a huge 4.5% to 32%.**

Google Cloud revenues grew a whopping 35% to $11.4Bn led by accelerated growth in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) across AI Infrastructure, Generative AI Solutions, and core GCP products, **with record operating margins of 17%** as the cost per AI query decreased by 90% over the past 18 months.

Cloud titans Amazon (AWS) and Microsoft (Azure) have commanded huge valuations for their cloud computing businesses; with Google Cloud growing at 35%, it should continue to narrow the gap over the next 5 years. Also importantly, AWS and Azure have operating margins over 30%, and should Google continue to scale and leverage their existing fixed costs, they can reach the same margins. I also believe as they get better at AI, they should be able to charge more.

Based on consensus analysts’ estimates Alphabet’s EPS should grow to $11.60 in 2027 from $5.80 in 2023 - that’s an annual growth rate of 18%. Comparatively, Apple‘s estimated EPS growth through FY2027 is slower at 14%, and it sports a P/E of 33 compared to Google’s 22. Alphabet’s P/E is closer to the S&P 500’s P/E of 21!

I believe this is too low, and there is a lot of potential for its stock to appreciate on the lower valuation.

Besides the strong EPS, a lot of Google’s expenses are noncash depreciation and amortization and their cash flow margins are strong. They generated operating cash of $31Bn on $88Bn last quarter, or a 35% cash flow margin.

The antitrust regulation will remain a possible negative on Alphabet, but the final decision is still years away as Alphabet vigorously appeals the decision.

**I recommend Alphabet as a buy at $176**",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ggjotg/alphabet_deserves_a_better_valuation/,332,"The down move after earnings is due to market movement as well as OPENai releasing a “search engine”.

Now the question is… in determining if this is a buy opportunity.

1. Does OPENAI have a better LLM than GOOG? A big huge advantage? Or are they coming into alignment as each platform evolves.

2. Does OPENai know how to run a search engine business? Is that their core competency? 

You decide on those two questions and you’ll know the answer.; I think they are the most well positioned, good value AI offering.

Their LM notebook is fucking astonishing with its new podcast feature. If you haven’t tried it, just go and do it now. Take something you wrote (or any large piece of text), whack it in there, wait a minute, then listen to their AI podcast. It’s the best thing I’ve seen yet from any AI system.

That’s just one thing, but their array of assets are also a fucking incredible, diverse and frankly unrivalled data source for their AI development.; Hopefully it stays low so that I can keep buying it lol; Open AI has been available to the public since 2016, and TikTok in 2016 as well. People say that these platforms are taking away Google's search moat, ***but there has been zero evidence of this when Google reports its search revenue.*** Seriously, if these did have a material effect on Google, we would have likely seen a decrease in revenue by now, but Google search revenue continues to be strong, as do all other aspects of the business.  I think anyone who buys the stock today will see above-market-average returns with a high degree of predictability.

  
just my 2 cents as a shareholder; I think a lot of people are reading way too far into today specifically re: OpenAI search engine and the DOJ law suit. At this stage, OpenAI isn't real competition and the DOJ has had an incredibly poor track record of antitrust claims agianst tech companies.

My interpretation of today's drop is simply proft taking - myself and almost everyone I know bought in big when GOOGL was sub $150 in early September (less than 2 months ago). I didn't sell, but I can totally understand wanting to crystalize 10+% gains in less than 2 months, especially before year end / election uncertainty.; Like two weeks ago I had no idea which stocks to buy. After this earnings week I've got like five and not enough cash. Alphabet is one of them.; Regardless of how you look at it , you win as a long term holder.

If the multiple stays depressed. The company can do buybacks and increase the EPS at a cheaper share price and have more capital available for other uses (larger divvies, R&D etc...)

If the multiple expands we see gains on equites. This is why stocks are amazing if you pick the right ones; They’re a great company and I agree a great long term buy at these prices. That said, the market has two huge worries on their mind: antitrust regulation and competition.

As long as regulators have their eyes on Google it makes future growth and acquisitions much harder. Their days of simply buying out any competitors before they can launch search products are probably over. As are the days of just openly bribing Apple and Samsung to make Google search the default cellphone browser. 

Then to top it off we have news today that OpenAI is adding search features to ChatGPT and that Meta is exploring search features in their products as well. 

All of these are massive net negatives to Google. Until we get more clarity on the impact, GOOG isn’t likely to make any big moves up imo; I love that they are integrating google into cars as most cars OS and navigation sucks absolute ass. Rented a Volvo once with google integrated and my next car will definitely have that. Was super convenient and it nullified the need for android auto and apple carplay; > with Google Cloud growing at 35%, it should continue to narrow the gap over the next 5 years

There is a mistrust to Google brand in general due to actions in consumer products and somewhat in cloud products too. You can't change product decisions constantly if you want to have brand confidence.

Ultimately it is not a big barrier but it means they have to work harder to get there.; They apparently need to start offering free lottery tickets on Google search that give you a good chance of winning money.


Seriously, it's just completely pathetic that a $2+ EPS just gets you a gap and fade and likely gap fill very soon just because every single news piece continues to whack the stock. In case y'all are wondering, if I can come up with a good tech alternative I like, I am starting to consider the possibility of closing out the position entirely if the stock can get over $200.; Everyone else has said it already, but the two reasons for Google trading lower is due to the antitrust concerns, and AI competition from Perplexity/OpenAI hurting their Search. 

I think an interesting factor in their latest report is the United States revenue which grew 19% and is the country that had a full quarter with AI overviews. It's just 1 datapoint, but it implies things going well with the AI overviews over Search. 

I guess question 1 is, can Alphabet pivot/update Search to take advantage of AI rather than AI eating their Search? If Yes, then they can do very well! Question 2 is, will AI competitors like openAI/Perplexity get strong enough to hurt Google Search? Well, google having competition is not new... Because I like the idea that, anywhere in the internet where there is a Search bar, is competition for Google Search. That can be Amazon where consumers Search for what they want to buy. Or Gen Z Searching on tik tok instead of Google. Or searching on one of Metas platforms. Using any of these instead of Google Search, is competition for Alphabet. 

So, if google can really improve and capitalize on Gemini and make it sticky with consumers, then even if it is not as good as Chatgpt, then they can still do very well.; . I bought 100 share at 181 and it crashed.. It was a great valuation even then... I still think it's great.. But yeah in the short term, especially with the elections, it's bound to swing wildly; Google is probably the most undervalued out of all the big tech companies. With the way their earnings have been going I wouldn’t be surprised if their Forward P/E is in the mid teens right now. Their growth is insane. Obviously it’s not perfect and these are the reasons why I think the stock remains depreciated compared to its peers.  

1. They just lost their case against the DOJ and have been identified by the government as a monopoly. Nobody knows the consequence’s going forward for this. 

2. In terms of rewarding shareholders they’re probably the worst. A lot of people are probably confused by this point as it looks like Google spends a lot on shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. 

If we look at last year for example Google made about 101 billion dollars in operating cash flow. If we subtract the 22.4 billion in stock based compensation and 32.2 billion in Capex that basically eliminates half their cash flow right there that can spend in buybacks and dividends. 

Now lets compare that its peers for example Apple. Apple did about 110 billion dollars in operating cash flow. About 10.8 billion went to stock based comp and another 10.9 billion went to Capex. That leaves about 90 billion that Apple is going to give back shareholders. Microsoft was in the same situation as Apple a couple of years ago but last year they basically doubled their Capex. Microsoft has also dialed back the buybacks this year as well and to be fair it makes sense considering their stock is extremely overpriced. 

If Google could cut back on the stock based comp and Capex and put more money towards their buybacks as well as continue to grow earnings and their cloud business at the current pace this stock could easily double from here.; !; Google has started putting an AI result at the top of the search results for me. 

Even they admit ""ten blue links"" is over.

And will their LLM be better than everyone else's? 

They have a lot of momentum in search but imo this will break their monopoly.; Stocks don’t seem to make sense; AI searches are stupid, and once you get into specialized terms/names, commonly used terms/names or foreign languages it just fails outright. 

I also I dont need google to spit out 50 results of the same webpage source just page 1 page 2 page 3, hell the summary of the page, the index of the page which is all of the same thing.

Microsoft is also doing the same damn thing too, the search results has been stupid in the last year.; They just got sued for more money in the world. How will they ever financially recover?/s; The monopoly point is precisely why it's not being turbo loaded. I think plenty are worried for a forced breakup. It's happened to companies in the past and had not too bad of an affect. But, still .makes a lot of investors have cold feet.; That is for sure.   Google made almost 2x what Apple made this quarter.  Yet Apple has a PE that is about 50% higher.

Google made $29 billion and Apple $15 billion.; Omg I have read this thread so many times. Ask yourself once what is Alphabet without search? Now factor that risk into the share price and move on with your life; I'm with you on all of the positives, and GOOG is my largest position, but don't overlook the negatives.  Lots of competition and legal issues on the horizon could mute future earnings.  It's recommend to plan for the worst but hope for the best, stay conservative.; 17B in fcf. Could explode if they layoff 50k people which the cfo said might happen; Not sure about being the only search engine in the US. Many countries Google is no longer popular.  Rarely looked at top half page which is all paid advertisements.; OpenAI just launched a competing search engine; I asked Chatgpt to translate a Chinese webpage and it directed me to make use of Google translate. 

Funny. 

Nah, Google is fine. Ultimately they will lose a chunk of their search market share because of the competition, but they have more things going on to offset it.; Nah; I have ChatGPT plus. Changed default search engine to ChatGPT search, following Sam Altman tweet. After using it - it will stay that way.

If I don't find what I'm looking for, I just go to ""google.com"" and search it there.

I no longer see tons of ads on top, mostly unrelated and with a tiny ad disclaimer. Google making lots their money from old people clicking on ads thinking it's a legitimate search result.


That's the main danger for Google. If 100 million people like me switch their default search engine to LLM based solutions, Google will crash.; Valuation matters; knowing what you’re buying can save you a lot of headaches. As Peter Lynch said, “Know what you own and why you own it”. At a surface level, Alphabet sounds like it has excellent potential. 

Understanding a company’s fair value is what sets the noobs and the sharps apart. 

This [valuation investment tool](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/stock_finance_pro/156572510618) offers insights that could help clarify things if you’re curious about assessing Alphabet’s fair value.; /u/Fountainheadusa what do you think of their Gemini AI offering and how it competes with other AIs like openAI, Copilot, and Groq? 

Their search revenue grew 13% this quarter but if they don't keep up with Gemini, could they lose out?; Dude besides ad rev, no one uses Google products besides search and Gmail. Their search is under huge threat via ais that will be embedded into device OS. Their search experience got its first face lift “ai overview” which is bullet points and summaries. Took open ai for them to that?? Lol 

This company hasn’t innovated in years. 

They’re not even a contender in enterprise data solutions, they’re around but be serious.; Wow, down to $171 again. Time to buy!; An average PE or 21 means about a 5% return on investment. (Typically above inflation). 

While growth factors, most people want a 10% return on average. At some point all stocks have to achieve this and thus the average has to approach that. Will large companies sustain that growth over 20 years? Likely not. Simply is not enough market and PE ratios have to average around that 10 mark at some point.; I don't know if you heard but Google is in the hole a decillion. Mother Russia owns it now.; >It has a near monopoly in Search


Being a monopoly isn't a great bragging point when the government wants to break you up. 


>Market leadership in media with YouTube.


This is already part of their valuation.


>A strong first-mover advantage with Waymo.


They aren't a first mover, and there's a lot of competition.


I'm not saying Google isn't a great company, but I'm not seeing why you think they're going to be more profitable than expected.; Alphabet is facing serious antitrust lawsuits.

We see this posted every time. I don't understand reddit obsession with alphabet. Until the antitrust goes away it will have a depressed valuation. That's the entire explanation. They may end up with decades of trials, a judgment against them and then decades of more trials as people sue them for damages after they're found guilty. It could total in the hundreds of billions. 

Professionals understand this. Redditors do not. Research how bad Microsofts antitrust was and what it did to the stock for 20 years.; As a Google consumer they suck the valuation is fair.; Just lol. Everything is valued way too high because of how propped up the entire market is and people are making way more money than they deserve for how dumb they are. When the next correction happens it's going to be a bloodbath for the self proclaimed traders; It doesn't.

It reflects poor management and execution the past decade and little confidence going forward.; Nope, it's a shit stock.; Only time will tell but I believe Google's search is at a big risk. The new AI assistants - the likes of Chatgpt, PerplexityAI, MetaAI, others) - will certainly lessen Google's search market share. To what extent, is hard to quantify at this time but it's downhill for Google from here on.; No it doesn't

They are the next yahoo

Search is going to fundamentally change and their monopoly will be broken

You just aren't thinking long term enough

I use Claude LLM just as much if not more than Google now; So much of their recent products have been crap though. I'd rather invest in something that I feel has growth.; I need to know how many searches on Google are actually questions, because if it’s more than about 25%, I’m not touching it, nor should anyone else who has used ChatGPT.

Also, I feel this company is becoming the next IBM or Intel - instead of innovating, they’re increasing revenues the wrong way by decreasing user experience and demanding payment for what used to be free levels of quality.; They have always lagged the other big tech stocks in valuation. Now with the legal issues pending, AI taking market share from search and no real way to monetize their AI why should GOOGL have a higher valuation?; I sold at $179, and took a $200 profit. TEPID is how I would describe GOOGL; AI Search Engines are known by 90% of the population for nearly 2 years now, yet Google regained market share over the summer. As of now they are just not user intuitive enough, fast enough and dont give the desired results. Google couldn‘t care less if you let ChatGPT explain a math problem to you. But Google does care if you plan to buy a new Car or Make-Up product. And this types of searches are just not done via AI. 

To ad on this, a search via AI costs x10 the amount of elecricity while yielding worse ad revenue. I am quite sure that all AI search engines will be Pay2Use at some point, which greatly reduces their attractiveness.; Many people use Google just as an entry point to other web pages. Why use an LLM for this.; Openai couldn’t even tell me the weather; Also, OpenAI with this Search product will be directly competing with MSFT with Bing. So conflicts going to arise, and maybe MSFT provides less support to OpenAi which might constrict them...very interesting dynamics at play; They need to figure out a way to make it a lot faster if they want to take some share from Google.

It is not just the fact that an LLM is going to be slower. But it is up and down the entire stack with network being a big one.

Google invented new protocols, QUIC, to make faster. They connect directly to the ISPs. Google created their own network processors to lower latency.

People are just to impatient. If they do not get an immediate response they will just go back to Google.

https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/02/09/google_processor/

It will be interesting to see if it gets any traction. Google just reported search numbers and they had double digit growth. So far it does not look like non Google LLMs are taking any share.; Google may very lose the LLM battle, but they are dominating the AI war.

OpenAI's CEO is a venture capitalist, not an AI/ML scientist.

OpenAI is based on open source models that they decided to close source--they privatized other people's work but still call themselves open.

OpenAI is a non-profit that trained their LLM on copyrighted data without permission. Now, they are trying to privatize their company, and monetize an AI trained on people's copyrighted data, and OpenAI's executives and key engineers are leaving en mass.

Microsoft is also increasingly distancing themselves from OpenAI. 

Microsoft also just announced that GitHub Copilot will include Google Gemini 1.5.

ChatGPT has been available to the public for over two years now, and Google Search's dominance has moved from 94% of the market to 90%, and now back to 92%.

gemini.google.com has more than 300 million active users.

And, Google was an early investor in Anthropic (and SpaceX).

But, LLMs represent less than 1% of Google's business.

Last month, Google's NotebookLM usership grew 400% from 500k users to 3 million users.

Google created the original Tensor libraries modern LLMs are based off. Google has been making specialized Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) purpose-built for training AI long before OpenAI even existed. Today's Trillium TPUs are comparable to NVIDIA's H100s and can be produced for a fraction of the cost.

Google has whole datacenters powered by their own chips. 

Google Pixels also run on Google's TPUs and Gemini.

Apple trains its AI on top of Google's TPUs.

Waymo, Google's autonomous driving segment, is absolutely dominating the space, providing 150,000 weekly rides, and just got valued at $45B. OpenAI, by the way, backed their own autonomous driving startup that did not get off the ground.

Google Wing has already made 350,000 drone deliveries for Walmart.

We haven't even begun to mention YouTube, Chrome, Cloud, GMail, Android, Home, Chromecast, Pixel Phones and Watches, Workspace, Drive, Maps, Nest, FitBit, News, PlayStore, Wallet, Chat, Video ... and Google's hundreds of other business segments, all of which have their own dedicated teams of AI engineers and researchers.; Google has been severely underdelivering in terms of LLM quality compared to competition in my view, also the search engine results have progressively gotten worse as time has gone on. I always have to add ""reddit"" to the queries to be able to get something that doesn't seem SEO spam or just AI generated SEO spam.; Can openai keep up with the cost as the traffic scales up for the search engine? i smell billions down the drain to keep up.; None of that is relevant. All shareholders need to know is that Google has huge cash piles and strong growth. Let’s stop finding justification for bs short-term movement; I think if there was ever that big of a threat from OpenAI to Google they would abandon all other investments and do whatever it takes to maintain search market share, maybe even acquire OpenAI. They are not going to simply give up on their competitive advantage / cash cow; I think the important thing to note here is that GOOGL has unlimited runway and openAI has a *ton* to do here to justify its economics. 

> OpenAI’s monthly revenue hit $300 million in August, up 1,700 percent since the beginning of 2023, and the company expects about $3.7 billion in annual sales this year, according to financial documents reviewed by The New York Times. OpenAI estimates that its revenue will balloon to $11.6 billion next year.
> But it expects to lose roughly $5 billion this year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses like employee salaries and office rent, according to an analysis by a financial professional who has also reviewed the documents. Those numbers do not include paying out equity-based compensation to employees, among several large expenses not fully explained in the documents.

 - Source: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/technology/openai-chatgpt-investors-funding.html

So, they are either going to have to massively raise prices (which probably kills growth if not reduces current usage) OR figure out how to manage costs better (reduce compute expense, which means train less? that'd also be a growth killer)? 

As bullish as I am on LLMs in general, so far the lack of accuracy is only solved by the pattern of sending an input, getting a result, and then sending the result back to say - hey double check, was that right? rinse repeat, so you need the economies of scale right now for it to continue to be useful in the way that it is today. 

Because of all that, I'm hesitantly bullish on both but I think openai has ""more to lose"" right now in terms of figuring out the ""economics"" problem while Google just has to keep iterating on its solutions. Search existed before Google but they won that market eventually. 

No positions in either, just how I'm considering the risks on both sides.; Yep. Either way I just bought 210 shares shortly after the market opened today. Prior to this I had only 36 shares.

I had been on the fence about liquidating one of my other positions to buy GOOGL shares for a while, but this earnings report, as well as the lack of much movement from the market despite how good it was, convinced me to pull the trigger today.; **Mixed opinions on Reddit is a strong BUY signal** 


 Same thing happened to PLTR a year ago. Someone even said, I'd rather hold Intel as an A.I. play instead of PLTR 😂


https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/173ge10/comment/k42w43z/
 ; Plus Google can buy back their own shares at great valuations...


Win win; Sorry but comparing 2016 Open AI (or even 2023 Open AI) to what they have now, makes no sense. I think before/after GPT4 is a better cut.; Young people don't search on Google anymore. They do it on tiktok and Instagram ; If you have an apple device and are given the choice to use Google Search or craplexity (a Tl;Dr google search) I think most people are picking the prior.

Regardless, the notion of Alphabet losing revenue from search has been thrown around since OpenAI's conception at this point. Meanwhile, GOOGL just reported their highest ever quarterly revenue (including search lol). They have been diversifying their revenue streams (unlike meta trying to break into hardware) with GCP and services.

This company just innovates like crazy. For example, the use of their in-house build Tensor processing units to bring down the costs of the Google Pixel 9 while outperforming many other flagship phones on the market. They smashed GP9 shipments worldwide.

From a regulatory standpoint, I see google as only having a gain. If TikTok gets banned, Youtube alone could command a 1 trillion dollar valuation based on NFLX multiple. Theres also concerns of how much money Open Ai loses and how many users it will eventually lose when it applies fees or spams ads on its chatbot; Meta might be a bigger threat to search than OpenAI; Yes, but Google and so many others are using AI tools in their domains, for example, if I get an answer from Google search via their AI button, I may never need to download ChatGPT - I've been using Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude, and Firefly in the past month and often there are few discernible differences so agreed about the competition but it will take a gargantuan effort to dislodge googling something.; PLTR. Wait until mid-$30’s for an entry. Stay for at least 3 years.; There’s a reddit trend lately to discount Google’s cashflow for their recent very increased CapEx, but you’re not giving them credit for increased returns in the future on that CapEx.

Google have purposefully increased their CapEx more than necessary in order to become the compute leader. This is not merely defensive maintenance CapEx to maintain current earnings. You don’t just cut CapEx and grow the cloud like you’re suggesting… this is how you get the cloud growth.; None of this matters because search in 5 years won't be the same as now and Google won't hold a monopoly

And you don't know what the % margin on ai ads will be compared to Traditional search

You are using historical financials to project the future for a sea change in the industry, incorrect thinking imo; I thought Claude was slightly better than Gemini in my limited usage. 13% growth in search is good, given how big the company is. Like all the other Gen AI aspirants, they will have to work harder. The interesting thing about Google is the huge data advantage and ability to lower costs by scaling - AI tokens and retrieval are expensive, I believe Google is getting advantages of scale by continuously lowering this variable cost of AI data retrieval - that is a bit of a competitive advantage over the likes of OpenAI.; With regards to Waymo, I do think they are first movers and leaders by a long shot.  I am curious what company you consider is and what is your rationale for it?; You couldn't be more wrong about Waymo not being a first mover. Waymo has been having cars drive around San Francisco for YEARS, and for over a year now they have been taking people on rides. You can download an app and order one just like an uber. What other company is even close to that?; Government has been wanting to break up MSFT and APPL as well, having a monopoly in search is not equivalent to being a monopoly. There are tons of competitors who are out there but the google branding is too strong. The worst case scenario out of this would be government saying google can’t pay apple 20 billion to make it default which would help their financials more than anything.

In what world is Waymo not a first mover and please list their competition; [deleted]; I spend a lot of time on the self driving cars subreddit, and the vast majority of opinions there is that waymo is very far ahead of Cruz and Tesla. There was one post where the top voted comment said they were likely several years ahead.; or they may be forced to spawn out into multiple companies, which will make the value of each individual branch be recognized by the market and generate a huge profit for those who owned GOOG before the split. I'm not into stock picking, but I still recognize the potential of GOOG at these prices. Only time can tell.; This.

Those lawsuits are a dark cloud above them. Could go different ways.; I use chatgpt for search; Lol; Google isn't growing enough for you?; but there search revenue is growing?; To add to that.   Search and prompting AI are not the same thing.   To effectively search with an LLM you need to ask the right question, but often times you don't know the right question to ask.  

While it's useful to have a ""dialog"" with an LLM, Google still holds the reins to getting you the information you want quickly.  Plus it has a proven search monetization strategy which will continue to grow.  

Finally, while yes the proverbial 2 people in a garage can technically disrupt an industry, Google has so much of a head start and data it'll be hard to imagine that Google will be replaced overnight.  Which then begs the question, do you believe Google leadership will identify potential technology threats and improve their product offering.; [deleted]; Assuming we're discussing the long term, I'd argue google definitely cares if your go to explainer of math (or whatever) problems becomes chatgpt. This behavior change definitely has the potential to have a $$ impact for the long term.; There are also so many creative thoughts out there, which is often what people want to read when they Google items. AI is practical. ; It took me almost 2 years to try Perplexity for the first time, but even though it's not easy to set it up to be the default search engine I rarely ever use Google anymore. I'm a techie, others will be even slower, but non-AI search engines are clearly going away.; Did you try with OpenAI search? It was definitely able to tell me the weather.; [deleted]; Great write up. 

I honestly think Google is the most undervalued stock in the market. It just has negative sentiment dragging it down.; So do you think goog can’t figure out that issue regarding the +reddit thing? 

Do we believe company performance is static? Will they improve or adjust?

The results show otherwise with search doing fine. Everything else up as hell.

But anecdotes are important but it sounds more like it’s important for the agile improvement team than for an investment decision.; The fact that I've been reading everywhere on reddit that GOOGL is undervalued for months makes me feel like it's probably wrong though.

If there's something I've learned after years on investing subs it's that when people all agree they should invest in something they're usually wrong.; That sounds like cherry picking more then anything. I can think of plenty of stocks with mixed opinions where the stock continued to sink, including Intel (for multiple years) and Boeing (prior to the pandemic).; That's not how buybacks work.; When I was searching “rechargeable heated jeacket” today on TikTok, most of the results were girls barely clothed, dancing, showing off their amazing talent. There is no way people use TikTok and Instagram rather than google. Maybe for food or clothing reviews and the like, which is more of a competitor to YouTube; No one does that.; A lot of those numbers are highly misleading.

The biggest issue being how exactly do you define a ""search""? Like if I go to YouTube and search for ""gaming PC"" is that a search? Is it a search if I instead search for the same thing on Google or Amazon.com? Or what if I instead search on YouTube for ""Funny cat video"", or the name of a content creator on YouTube, are those searches?

And if the Amazon and YouTube searches count as ""searches"", am I choosing Amazon or YouTube as my new search engine? Or am I just using different websites for their specific niches?

Point being this isn't a simple black and white thing. People count what a search is differently, which gives wildly different results to things like if Google search is losing relevance or not.; When you say young, you mean 10-15 year olds? I literally know nobody searching tik tok for other than reviews on a product. Then they go search it in google for more info. You are talking about a competitor for review websites, not google search.; > If TikTok gets banned, Youtube alone could command a 1 trillion dollar valuation based on NFLX multiple.

YT is already worth more than Netflix straight up IMO even if that doesn’t happen. 70 billion shorts watched per day and growing. Probably 9/10 people reading this comment watch YT much more than Netflix.; Google tensor is literally the slowest processor of all flagship phones and by a huge margin too; I think the use cases for traditional search is much different than LLM queries. Ai overview can do what chatGPT does for a majority generic search queries. I see LLMs being used more for analyzing search driven outcomes (Academic reports, work presentations etc..) These are two very different things and actually suggests that LLMs will promote the use of web search further which I believe will be the ultimate case

Then again google owns NoteBook LM which is a more  intensive LLM based application tool which helps things like summarizing a clinical research study that you find on JAMA through a google search.

oddly enough for me , one of the biggest threats IMO to google search that doesnt get talked about enough is Reddit. Reddit search is innately unique and different than google. I see this competing with google search in a impactful way; That Reddit trend seems to be to ignore all the negatives and act like this company is perfect in every way. That seems to be more of the case based on the comments.; The concept of looking at historical numbers to help see the future is part of the game in investing. I am not bearish on the stock and I even own shares but my god the amount of d**k sucking this sub does for this company is off the charts. Like you say one bad thing about this company and people get so emotional about it and they think the company can do no wrong and it’s all great. Yeah I guess none of what I said matters. Yet thats why the stock has underperformed its peers over the last year.; Waymo is hands down the market leader at the moment in autonomous drive (Level 4 or above). It's not even close. Some will argue that their system is ""fenced-in"" but they are taking the smart gradual approach to avoid regulatory scrutiny. Last thing you want to do is create a system that causes the odd injury/death and facing lawsuits/headlines constantly. In the early days, Safety is paramount to get public trust. Waymo has very strong reviews/favorability in their regions they operate. From what I read from a Verge article, Waymo does have Level 5 intentions. [https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24283516/waymo-google-gemini-llm-ai-robotaxi](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24283516/waymo-google-gemini-llm-ai-robotaxi); Not OP, but IMO Google won't be seeing any kind of serious profits from Waymo anytime soon. If anything it'll continue to be a drain on their resources as they pump more into R&D and expanding it.

IMO what Waymo is currently going for is just peanuts compared to the true profit that there will be in self driving vehicles. But the problem is that the other use cases won't really work until Waymo can drive you anywhere from the East coast to anywhere on the West coast. I think that the real profits long term aren't going to be in a robo-taxi business at all, but things like:

* Ditching drivers in semi-trucks and just having robo-trucks haul cargo across the US. This alone could bring in such an absurd amount of money each year.

* Replacing humans in last mile delivery services, so that a robo-van/truck can drive up to someone's else, and a drone can deliver the package to their porch. 

* Selling self driving vehicles to consumers as a convenience and safety feature. (IMO I remain deeply skeptical that robo-taxis can ever replace human drivers. Car culture is just too strong, and I've run the numbers, and I just don't see how a robotaxi could ever be cheaper than car ownership for the average American); Google saves $20Bn and Apple users still prefer Google/Chrome to Safari![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|feels_good_man); No, but them having better self driving than Tesla doesn't give them first mover advantage ; Sure, that's the best case scenario. They'll still have to pay for damages foe all of the businesses they used monopoly power against, which could be an ENORMOUS sum; I use Meta AI search and found to be quite useful. (not a fan of facebook or instagram but they seem to have done a good work on their LLMs).; Through their app or on desktop? Are the search results comparable to Google search engine?; They can grow, I just don't believe in their new products. Therefore I don't want my dollars marching for Google; Revenue is growing at 12% from search, but that could also be driven by price increases. The number of searches will decline over the next few years IMO due to AI searches. But you never know, maybe they figure it out and leverage AI. Personally, I'm not so sure... but that's what makes a market.; When you ask an LLM to do  search, it basically asks an actual search engine and organizes the result for you. The process is called RAG (retrieval augmented generation). It is more expensive, inferior for queries that aren't general knowledge, lack in modalities and real time navigation, but more importantly prone to hallucinations.; >do you believe Google leadership will identify potential technology threats and improve their product offering.

I believe they will identify threats and introduce multiple Solutions competing with themselves. Eventually rebranding some of those Solutions and combining them and getting rid of others entirely. After maybe a couple of years I suspect they will probably cancel everything all together and then maybe replace it all with something else again and with less functionality than they started with the very beginning.

I have held GOOG for about 9 years though and don't plan to sell it anytime soon.; >but will simply lose a noticeable market share

DOJ in it's lawsuit against Alphabet quoted Google's internal findings that the firm wouldn't lose search market share even if the quality of their Google search significantly drops.; They arent. ChatGPTs market share declined over summer, while Google gained market share. 

Furthermore ad-relevant search requests just dont need AI. Yes, when I have a knowledge question during my studies, I also like to have ChatGPT explain it to me. But if I’m looking for the nearest restaurant or a mobile phone for my mum, I’ll always use Google. Because it’s far too complicated to make a sensible enquiry to AI systems and the answer is usually not what I’m looking for. Less tech-savvy people are even slower at this sort of thing. Change may happen, but over the span of generation. Look at PayPal, its also not dead, although there are clearly better solutions. And for Google that isnt even the case.

At the moment, all AI engines are gimmicks that are difficult to monetise.; Yep. The first thing I did. Weather in nyc. Said you need a plugin; It does, but it detracts from bing ad revenue; The most searched term on Bing is Google 😂; I'm just seeing their products stagnating and not keeping up with competition, that's it.; Regardless of if Google goes up or down people are going to say ""reddit was wrong"", because there's people expressing opinions on both sides in these threads.

IMO a lot of the ""reddit was wrong"" sentiment is often revisionist history in this way where the sizeable number of people with counter opinions are just ignored. Also keep in mind not everyone giving their opinions that stocks XYZ is a great/terrible buy has done a deep dive into it and read the 10K's/etc. I freely admit I do this all the time at reddit (but not for Google, I did the research there), and I know I'm not the only one.; I bought some when Hitler was light skin Vietnamese and most users here hated it. Now I’m definitely going to hold back.; Ummm...yes it abso-fucking-lutely is. What are you talking about?; Honestly this is exactly what I’m thinking anything that you can type text into a spit out answer is a search engine.; Waymo is also something that gets completely shrugged off. Waymo just had a financing round last week and the autonomous driving unit  was valued at more than $45B. The idea of having A.i Robotaxis is massive for so many different applications (driveway delivery, enterprise level logistic needs, personal taxi services, google Maps infrastructure autonomy and OPex expansion) . Waymo reached 1 million miles traveled. Im extremely bullish on this segment. I dont think competition is a concern here (Tesla , for example) since this space has a massive TAM. Regulatory approval is the only issue and Waymo going city by city is a much better approach than how TSLA FSD is doing their mass rollout

[https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/technology/2024/10/31/alphabets-waymo-valued-at-more-than-45-billion-after-funding/](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/technology/2024/10/31/alphabets-waymo-valued-at-more-than-45-billion-after-funding/)

Verily by alphabet also uses true Ai based applications designed by Deepmind (alphaFold) to  determine the 3-D sequences of proteins to design biological and small molecules inhibitors for a variety of diseases. It currently generates around half a billion in revenue in their other bets segment and has massive potential in the biotech space. It's truly an incredible piece of technology and someone at Deepmind received a noble prize for it this year. Its going to cure alot of diseases

Netflix is closer to 38B in revenue. Margins are likely similar but I think Netflix has more operating leverage moving forward given they own the content and don’t have to share a % with creators; Because the financials are still top notch. Plus the argument that Search is getting sidelined is also complete nonsense. I see regards here all the time talking about how they use Craplexity or ChatGPT, when in reality, Reddit is a niche group of tech-savvy people (ish). Your avarage Joe Schmoe is still going to be using for years to come, simply because it's just part of our lives now. Plus DOJ is literally a joke, as a law student I can tell you that the arguments they have are literally just that Google is too good. It's a no brainer investment and honestly I'm debating going all in.; Lol, my comment was bearish on the stock, I thought you were bullish; [deleted]; Alphabet could pay the historically largest anti trust fine 150 times over with current cash.; Nice.  Will check it out; You don't use Google search? You'd be the first guy I know who doesn't; [deleted]; People care about convenience and ease...Google is easy and familiar..people might go try perplexity or chatgpt once then go back to Google...; I asked for an obscure city where I live and I got a response with 10 sources on the right, and main content being the exact weather at current time, and even including future weather with icons. Are you sure it's enabled for you?

""Weather in nyc"" gives me also an answer similar. It even related one of the days to NYC marathon.

I got - and the response was really quick:

Please note that a Red Flag Warning is in effect from 8:00 AM to 7:00 PM EDT on Friday, November 1, due to expected strong winds and low humidity, which can lead to rapid fire spread.; Yea; But if Bing gets similar cut from it using its APIs it doesn't matter.; So the LLM answers in addition to search results aren’t keeping up? Google podcast tool isn’t keeping up? 

Waymo isn’t keeping up? 

Idk, I feel like a deep dive without bias would help you gather a bit more of the reality of Google vs the competition.; It is just an alternative way to pay a dividend. They aren't ""investing"" in google.; Many areas of proven growth and more emerging areas of future possible growth at a sub 20 pe ratio. Unbelievable.; TSLA hasn't actually even begun the regulartory approval process for driverless cars.; I don’t think that’s true of Netflix. They either pay huge licensing fees (which get renegotiated upwards every time revenue increases because of them, holding the margin) or development costs. They’re successfully moving more of the mix towards developing, but I constantly wonder if they’ll develop something that gets them cancelled by the USA cancel culture.

Meanwhile, Google pays a lot less for shorts views than they do for old youtube videos, and meanwhile CapEx scaling and TPU development are bringing their costs down on the other end.

Another point: Netflix pays money up front to develop something that may not air for years, whether it is successful or not. YouTube pays its creators a piece of the pie only when the video succeeds. And the creators buy their own CapEx (often iPhones now). Very cashflow friendly.

I would choose Youtube straight up between the two. I’d be mortified if you told me I could never use YouTube again. Netflix I can take or leave.; 1. I never once said anything about their search engine. Their search engine is actually one of my bullish arguments so you’re kind of just yapping at air on that one.

2. The DOJ won their case. If they didn’t have an argument they wouldn’t have won so I don’t know what you’re talking about. This isn’t another Microsoft/Apple cause both Microsoft and Apple won theirs. Google lost so clearly they had a case.; I interpreted you saying Google won’t hold a monopoly in 5 years as a bullish statement.; In the ""We got there first"" funding from investors and government sense? Definitely Tesla.; The fine isn't the issue, it's the 10,000 lawsuits from every business, individual, and ambulance chasing lawyer after you're found guilty.

In Microsoft case this was multiple $100million, $10million and $1 million lawsuits (those were 20 years ago, so multiple the numbers for today's values. Would not be surprised to see the first billion dollar judgments here) that they did have to settle, because they were indeed guilty.

Furthermore at least in Microsofts case the trials continued for about 15 years after the verdict until they just stopped fighting it and settled everything without a fight. It is an enormous distraction for the company, it makes regulators continue scrutinizing them, and it forces them to keep an army of lawyers more than they otherwise would on their payroll.; Hardly- I haven’t touched google search in years. Originally switched to DuckDuckGo, as part of some general effort to improve privacy, decrease tracking, etc. Gave up on that eventually, but kept using Duck because the search results honestly seem better. Google search is just populated by ads and SEO’d articles - you’ve pretty much gotta add “Reddit” to the end to get real, human generated results.; I see it as a declining asset. I don't use it nearly as much as I used to.; I agree - goes to show you that consumer do not have much choice; Exactly. All Perplexity (or ChatGPT/Anthropic) needs to do is come out with something convenient, with no login required, and Google is going to suffer.; I’m not sure we’re using the same search bar. I used the new OpenAI search bar and it didn’t work. I will try again; No clue why you're getting downvoted.

People probably still don't understand what ""chatgpt search"" is; I know how buybacks work. Buybacks done at cheaper valuations yield more shareholder value than buybacks at more expensive valuations.


$GOOG buying shares here at 22x is more accretive to shareholder value than if they were buying at 38x or 40x.; Elon already hinted at the overall rollout paradigm. He stated TSLA plans to use a FSD completion --.> model 3 (supervised) ---> model 3 (unsupervised) + Robocar rollout. The supervision part is where TSLA is able to leverage the ""car company"" portion of their moat to speed run the approval process. Waymo obviously cant do this.

But im not concerned I own both stocks and I think developments by both companies ultimately help each other. Both Waymo and Tesla FSD (preliminary) data showed that autonomous driving is safe and even safer than human drivers. As long as they continue to demonstrate that then I dont see the incentive for governments to block the rollout.; Yea and when Waymo finally conquers Phoenix in 10 years, Tesla will be autonomously driving on Mars. I'm sure Reddit will say it wasn't fair though and ""Elon didn't technically achieve it even though Tesla won the battle...AND IF HE HAD ONLY JUST VOTED FOR KAMALA LIKE I WANTED HIM TO! WAHHHH!"" :); Gmail? Google drive? Google maps? Yt?; No they don't that is not how that works. It has a fixed cash value. They can either pay out $1B or buy back $1B, the only difference is that the buy back increases the share price.  

This is the thing most redditors get obnoxiously wrong and can never explain why it isn't the same as a dividend.; Supervised -> Unsupervised is by far the hardest part of the whole process. Additionally, Tesla relying on a completely different sensor suite means the approval process will likely be very different, as regulatory bodies will be concerned about deficiencies of camera only systems. This is a long discussed topic, but a quick reason is single sensor platforms are naturally less reliable as they lack redundancy and risk single sources of failure.; Waymo robotaxi's are already available in SF as well! Highly recommend giving it a try, it's super cool. Took it multiple times a few weeks ago with no issue :D; Yea but its better when they buy it at a cheaper price meaning they can buy more shares which also means that eps will rise because there are less shares outstanding. A rise in EPS yields a better shareholder value.; I just think it's pointless getting into those tiny nuanced details. So far both SF and phoenix have been very welcoming to WAYMO. the main point is that the TAM of this market segment is massive and that both services will do very well. Just think of how it will connect people, goods & services 

  
[https://www.phoenix.gov/newsroom/aviation/2548](https://www.phoenix.gov/newsroom/aviation/2548); I honestly am excited about both! I'm annoyed by the irrational Tesla hate because it kept me from driving one for a long time and they're absolutely amazing, especially FSD.; [removed]; For sure, but I don't think it is a minor nuance - I think it actually is the biggest blockers of the whole project. If it can't get regulatory approval (which likely won't be sped up by waymos precedence due to different sensor paradigms), then the whole effort is DoA.; We were promised self driving by the next year - in 2016... Elon is a great engineer and I'm certain our kids will be reading about him in the history books, but the Tesla is filled with problems. Priced like a tech stock, with a growth no where near that. It's pure hopium; Man, you’re stubborn. The price of a stock can be expensive or cheap. Just look at KO, which trades at a 27 P/E but has a -7% earnings growth rate. That means KO is relatively more expensive than GOOGL, which has a 23 P/E and a 30% earnings growth rate. People are willing to pay more for KO stock because of its relatively safe business and long track record, making it pricier than GOOGL.

You can also check historical P/E ratios to see if a stock is cheaper than its historical value.; [removed]"
Brokerage refusing to update my cost basis after it was received,"Hi - I made an in-kind transfer equities transfer from Etrade to Robinhood in 2022. (Please don't roast me for the choice of Robinhood - long story but it was the right decision at the time for certain reasons, e.g. access to margin at a really low rate, interest on sweep etc.)

Equities were purchased between 2018 and 2021, then transferred in 2022. 

I now sold some of the equities made in that in-kind transfer - and Robinhood sent me a 1099 form with those equities as uncovered lots with a $0 cost basis.

I spent several weeks back and forth between Etrade and Robinhood, trying to ensure that the cost basis transfer was made. It took a lot, but in the end I got confirmation from Robinhood that they have received the cost basis from Etrade.

The cost basis was sent/received in August of this year.

However, all Robinhood say they are able to provide me in terms of a proper cost basis (after receiving it from Etrade) is an Excel CSV export (assume what they received from Etrade). They say I must now take this export to a tax professional to submit my own cost basis along with my uncovered securities 1099.

I know the easy answer is ""this is the treatment you get with a joke of a broker like Robinhood"" - which may very well be the case.

But my understanding is that the receiving brokerage of an in-kind transfer is legally obligated to receive and update the cost basis from the sending brokerage. This is not really a discretionary element.

Robinhood refuse to send me an updated 1099, and say its an industry standard that individuals have to self-report the cost basis on uncovered lots. However, these are only ""uncovered lots"" because Robinhood is not fulfilling their obligation of updating the cost basis they have confirmed that they have received.

Specific questions:  
\- Does anyone know if I can go after them from a legal obligation standpoint on this? I have tried everything in terms of tantrums and explanations over email/phone  
\- In what format could I demand an updated cost basis from Robinhood? Is it an updated 1099 or some other document?  
\- Will I have the same problem as I continue to sell off equities from this in-kind transfer for future tax years? Where Robinhood will never include the cost basis and have them as uncovered lots in my 1099s?

Thanks so much for your help and self-restraing in crucifying me for choosing Robinhood.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ggemby/brokerage_refusing_to_update_my_cost_basis_after/,0,"You have to do this yourself when you do your taxes. It’s not a big deal.; I have had this occur at other brokerages so it is not a Robinhood only issue.  Using your updated cost basis is not a big deal. ; As a person who has done many tax returns my thought is, who gives a shit. You have the basis? Ok, great. Consider getting basis conform from E*trade to make sure it accurate? Sure. Will your return be different I. The end? No, doesn’t make a difference. Gain / loss is the same in the end, just means you need to do some work to track cost basis on sales.; You should keep track of the cost basis in your records.  If/When you do finally sell, you will report the basis that Robinhood has on the 1099 they give you.  You will then report an adjusted basis on the tax form to correct for the incorrect basis on the 1099 that they give you.  You should keep records in case the IRS ever asks you about this (from the previous broker, buy/sell dates, or anything you can use to prove the basis you used).  It is really not a big deal and the IRS sees it all the time.  Pretty much every standard tax software can handle it, and so can your tax preparer if you use one.  Nothing to worry about.; question for a tax filer; You can just self report when you do your taxes. It’s not a big deal at all.; Who cares? YOU tell the IRS what YOUR cost basis is. Not the brokerage. They just provide a simple record but legally YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE and YOU can declare whatever you want as long as YOU HAVE THE RECORDS.; If you at least know the date(s) you bought you can look up the SP on those dates.  Of course if you have statements that show transactions (purchases, sales) that works, too. 

Brokerages do not report cost basis info to the IRS on sales of securities acquired before the date (2012?) when they first became obliged to report basis info. So, as others have said, you provide your own basis info on your tax return.; Lots of people saying this isn't a big deal but seems like a big pain to me if you have more than a few positions. Gotta keep track of dividends, adjust for splits, etc. Maybe there's an easy online resource for that but it's still work; Just go to TurboTax and do it; I think you need to file form 8949 where you will declare your cost basis. Currently dealing with a similar situation. It even says 8949 on my 1099 where the cost basis is listed as N/A. I bet yours will too.; Everyone else has answered. But I’m just hear to remark on the beauty of being too lazy/stubborn/cheap to seek a tax professional while also inquiring about pursuing legal action 🤣.; For legal options, it might be worth mentioning to Robinhood that you'll file a complaint with FINRA or the SEC if they don't update your cost basis properly. But honestly, it’s usually faster to self-report with your tax pro using the CSV they provided.; I tried looking it up online - but how do I do this myself? Am I an idiot for not keeping records of the cost basis myself? Or do I have to request it from Etrade? I dont have the detailed cost basis for those equities...; They don't care; absolute waste of time. Brokerages have no obligation to do your homework.; Yes, you are an idiot. 

Always save at least your December statements so you have a record of cost basis. 

Yes, you should probably be able to get the info from Etrade. You may even be able to log into Etrade now as they usually save online statements for 7 years.

When you file your taxes use your actual cost basis and you are all set.; Your old brokerage will have a cost basis; also if you have a record of WHEN PURCHASED you can just ""ball park it"".

""Well the VWAP was at $this price the time of purchase so lets ball park a $this cost basis and call it good"".

If they IRS accepts your answer great, if not, do whatever they want. It's just a negotiation."
Dropbox - The outsider with a sticky product,"**1.0 Introduction**

Back in 2017, two MIT students (Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi) secured funding from seed accelerator Y Combinator, for what would become Dropbox, one of the first companies to offer **cloud storage and file syncing**.

It had a first-mover advantage, that combined with a simple user-friendly interface, and a freemium model, allowed the company to grow from **1 million** registered users back in April 2009, to over **700 million** in 2021. Although this sounds impressive, I’ll argue this is *a pointless metric*, but I’ll get back to that.

The freemium model attracted many users to test out their product and access a limited amount of storage for free. If they need more storage, then they can opt for various paid plans (Dropbox Plus, Dropbox Business).



**2.0 An incredibly sticky product**

A crucial property to take into account is the **stickiness** of the product**.**

***The perceived risk and effort involved in transferring large volumes of data often outweigh the potential savings of switching services.***

Cloud storage platforms hold critical, often irreplaceable, data that users depend on for continuity and productivity. The migration process can seem risky—not just for the potential of data loss or corruption, but also for the disruption it could cause to established workflows and collaborative setups.

Moreover, the time cost of planning, executing, and verifying a migration is significant for larger organizations.

***Even if a competitor offers a cheaper option, the combined weight of time, complexity, and the fear of potential issues can make the cost savings feel secondary.***

For many users, the existing service might offer just enough value or reliability to make the switch feel unnecessary, reinforcing Dropbox's and similar platforms' stickiness.



**3.0 The pointless metric & what actually matters.**

It is not unusual for companies to have some sort of storytelling element in their disclosures, press releases, or earnings reports. The purpose of these elements is nothing else but to create excitement, even if it is pointless.

You’ll notice, Dropbox chose **registered**, instead of **active**. Given that their base model is free, once someone becomes a user, that person remains a user **forever!** So the number of registered users will always go up.

However, if we take a look at the paid subscribers, historically, that is **\~2.5%** of the registered users. **So, 97.5% of all registered users are freeloaders** ***(including myself)*** **and add no value to the company.**

Don’t get me wrong, having over 18 million paid subscribers is impressive. It is important to focus on this number and acknowledge that the growth days are behind.

The competition is fierce, ranging from Google and Amazon to Microsoft and Apple. What surprised me was that during the pandemic, there was ***no growth acceleration.***



**4.0 The past acquisitions**

The company has engaged in numerous acquisitions:

* **July 2012, TapEngage** \- *a startup that enables advertisers and publishers to collaborate on tablet-optimized advertising.*
* **December 2012, Audiogalaxy** \- *a startup allowing users to store their music files and playlists in the cloud and then stream them to any device.*
* **December 2012, Snapjoy** \- *a company allowing users to ""aggregate, archive and view all of their digital photos from their cameras, phones and popular apps.*
* **July 2013, Endorse** \- *a mobile coupon startup.*
* **April 2014, Loom** \- *a photo-sharing company which would be shut down and integrated with the then-recently announced Carouse*
* **April 2014, Hackpad** \- *a document-sharing startup*
* **May 2014, Bubbli -** *a startup that has built some innovative ways of incorporating 3D technology into 2D views, and packaging it in a mobile app.*
* **January 2015, CloudOn** \- *a company that provided mobile applications for document editing and creation.*
* **January 2019, HelloSign** \- *e-signature company* ***(largest acquisition $230m).***
* **March 2021, DocSend** \- *secure document sharing and analytics product.*
* **October 2021, Command E** \- universal search company
* **November 2022, Boxcryptor** \- *end-to-end zero-knowledge encryption for cloud storage services*
* **December 2022, FormSwift** \- *form management platform*



There have been many studies that acquisitions (on average) tend to destroy shareholders’ value. If you agree with that, then Dropbox should be avoided like the plague given their past activity.



**5.0 The financials**

If you look at the financials, this is impressive, especially given the fact that they’re competing with Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple.

The revenue grew from $845m back in 2016 to $2.5 billion in the last twelve months.

The operating margin improved from **-23%** (-$194m) to **+26%** ($670m).

A lot of focus (especially from the management) goes to FCF and there’s a reason for that. Every company that has high stock-based compensation would like to focus on the free cash flow, as SBC is a non-cash expense.

From 2018 (when the company became public) until H1-2024, the company generated **$3.9 billion** in free cash flow. This might sound impressive, given its market cap is $8.5 billion, however, it incurred **$2.3 billion** in stock-based compensation.

So, where did the $3.9 billion go to? **Share buybacks.** The number of shares outstanding is down \~20% since becoming a public company.

Based on their capital allocation over the last 5 years, it seems as if their capital allocation strategy has changed from **acquiring more companies** to **returning capital to the shareholders via buybacks**.

  
**6.0 The valuation**

How does one value a company of this kind?

It has a sticky product that generates relatively stable cash flow that is returned to the shareholders via buybacks. I’ll argue that it has a lot of similarities with a bond and a **dividend discount model** is an appropriate model to value a company of this kind.

Except, instead of using the dividend, I’ll use **free cash flow** **- SBC.**

Inputs:

Free cash flow - SBC of $450m.

Growth in perpetuity of 4%.

Discount rate of 8%.

Adjusting for cash/debt

The value of the company is $8.8 billion ($27/share), which isn't that far off from today's share price of $26/share.

  
**7.0 My thoughts**

A company with a sticky product that has stable financial performance is expected to be less volatile than the average company out there. This is indeed the case, and the stock price beta is 0.6. Beta is a measure of risk that compares the volatility of the share price vs. an index (in this case, the S&P500). However, low risk goes hand in hand with low return. Therefore, expecting \~8% long-term yield seems fair.

I don’t find this an attractive opportunity, at this price point. However, *if the share price decreases to $20*, then the answer would be different.

The only scenario where I see a significant upside is if Dropbox is being acquired by a giant, such as Salesforce.

Anyone still rather buy Nike over Google?,"A month ago I posted a question asking why anyone would buy Nike when they can buy Google?  

I got a lot of apples and oranges responses.
I understand they are in different industries but a dollar is a dollar and I rather spend it on a stock with better value. Google is a way better company in every metric (even before today's earnings). 

I also got a lot of responses like ChatGpt will destroy search and Lina Khan will smash it into a million pieces.

Anyone still rather buy Nike over Google? 🍿",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gfgki6/anyone_still_rather_buy_nike_over_google/,0,"nike street view or nikeyoutube would not be good; Hard pass; MAFT better; UAA a better stock for the next 3 years..   MMW!; AI search wont replace google search. It's too specific and leave no place for ads.; Forget that they are in different categories. It’s not even the same investment thesis. A value investor would still pick Nike over Google, whiles growth investor might pick Google.; Sold all my Nike clothes 5 years ago. Stopped wearing them.; Nike Page Speed, we’re gonna let this one run 😂; Fellow pc user. my man

Edit. Anyway, been buying google every dip since it was at 80. Hearing about them losing market share for 3 years now and it’s still above 90% for search while cloud, youtube and others are killing it.; You are right; I haven't bought an Apple product in my life but somehow their stock has still soared.; And do you wear Google now?; I don’t drink coke or eat mcds but I still invest in them both because they’re good companies.; Yeah I converted 4 years ago and I now know why. Nike isn’t really in right now. Especially with younger generation.; Nah switched to Apple Watch.; Yeah they good. Unlike Nike. It’s hard to beat Coke’s moat. Their recipe is top notch. McDonald’s is solid too. They getting squeezed by some other fast food but still very popular worldwide.; Nike is very popular with young people in Europe; >9 oct 2024 — Nike is still ranks as the number one footwear brand among Gen Z teens for fall 2024, according to Piper Sandler’s 48th semi-annual “Taking Stock With Teens” survey, the company’s dominance in the demographic may be waning.; Adidas, new balance, reebok, chucks. Nike not as much. May depend on the country?; Eastern Europe here - Nike in 2024 is cringe for us 😂 Funny how consumers are so different based on a region, even though it’s the same company! 🙂; Never heard of piper Sandler. But I can tell you all the teens I work with wear new balance or hokas. Just got back from trip in Asia, all I see is new balance everywhere, hokas, on clouds. Nike needs a whole new vision forward if they want to keep their customers.; They're popular in England (clothing)
Not sure about other countries; 100 year old investment bank and financial services company with 1 billion annual revenue. The do this survey twice a year. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_Sandler_Companies

What you’re explaining is called anecdotal evidence, paired with framing and confirmation bias.; Ya anecdotal but listen to the crowds, listen to ppl around you, and look at their numbers, it’s gonna be stay uglier a lot longer before they get better. Also, surveys don’t mean much anymore. Look at how inaccurate polling is nowadays.; Decker the company owning Hoka made 1.3 billion last quarter. About 40% of that is Hoka. New Balance is not a public company but apparently did 6.5 billion in total in 2023.  
Nike did 11 billion just last quarter and about 65% of that is their footwear business.

You can look at the teen survey, you can look at the numbers. Nike is clearly still way ahead. 

What is inaccurate about the polling? Asking people about their favorite brands is literally listing to ""the crowds""; Young ppl don’t respond to polls nowadays. Depends how the poll is conducted. Via email? Via landline? In person? Too many variables and biases. 

The other companies are gonna eat Nikes lunch. They need new stars, their athletes are aging and not what young ppl want. Their running shoes are lackluster with exception of their elite line alpha and vaporflys. 

Been to so many run clubs around my city. Barely anyone excited about Nikes. 

I’m not a Nike hater, but they really need to change their strategy or do something. There’s a reason why their stock is where it’s at.; That does not apply to surveys that ONLY question teens. 

>The Piper Sandler Taking Stock With Teens® survey is a semi-annual research project that gathers input from 13,515 teens with an average age of 15.8 years. Discretionary spending patterns, fashion trends, technology, brand and media preferences are assessed through surveying a geographically diverse subset of high schools across the U.S. Since the project began in 2001, Piper Sandler has surveyed more than 267,818 teens and collected over 63 million data points on teen spending.​​

Ok so you said to look at the numbers and listen to people, both indicate that Nike is still far ahead. Now all you’re referring to is your personal opinion? You’re constantly pushing the goalposts. I think we can end the conversation here."
Prediction: Apple is grossly priced compared to Microsoft,"Congrats to those that followed my last Costco post. I don’t believe anyone can really predict the ups and downs of the market, and with the current market climbing past ATH’s, the safest bets are going to be balanced long-short positions in specific equities or spread bets. 

**Apple**

* Market cap: 3.6T
* Current P/E: \~36
* Average P/E last 5 years: 28.6
* Historical revenue growth: Flat to single digits
* Earnings growth: Low double digits
* Net Margin: 25%

 **Microsoft**

* Market cap: 3.2T
* Microsoft P/E: \~36
* Average P/E last 5 years: 32.8
* Historical revenue growth: 15%
* Earnings growth: 15-20%
* Net margin: 35%

Last week, Apple had a higher P/E than MSFT, before this narrowed in the last few days Relative to Microsoft. Apple is still at historically high valuations relative to MSFT, despite Microsoft having better margins and growth. And the reasons are silly. Apple is getting a massive boost due to a ""potential supercycle"" with no proof that it’s actually happening (even the most optimistic projections are just slightly better than last year) and mediocre software releases, while Microsoft took a large hit last quarter because it forecasted larger capex and delays in direct GenAI revenue realization.

In my view, the market is pricing in a divergent and fundamental misunderstanding of GenAI and how it makes money. The Apple bull case hypothesis is correct, it’s just applied to the wrong company. The Microsoft supercycle isn’t going to be from direct GenAI subscriptions like Co-pilot, it’s going to be share shift towards Azure and increased utilization.

To me it is hopium to believe that retail consumers will be rushing aggressively to switch or upgrade their phones over a nascent GenAI capability that is inferior to its peers (other than privacy) and unlocks nominal value, while mid-large corporates won’t be doing the exact same for Microsoft for what is widely considered a top-notch set of capabilities and proven effectiveness in several emerging use cases.

Here’s my prediction – regardless of where the market goes, I believe there is going to be a strong and continued divergence between Microsoft & Apple performance in the next few months, with at least another 5% gap between the winner and loser, with Microsoft’s P/E once against comfortably retaking the lead from Apple. Good luck and we'll see!

Tl;dr: Short Apple / Long Microsoft

P.S. Seeing a lot of people triggered by the tl;dr recommendation not having a basic understanding of what long-short position is. A balanced long-short position doesn't mean I believe Apple will go down on nominal terms, just that it will go down relative to Microsoft. Using options or a long-short position is the way to extract value when you see the spread in two equities increase.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gf523l/prediction_apple_is_grossly_priced_compared_to/,355,"I 100% agree with your post. Still I would NEVER short Apple.; Apple goes up because of the constant buybacks it keeps doing, reducing their float.; What you have to remember about AAPL is; 

1. Everyone on the sell side wants to keep you know who happy and will issue horseshit reports to do so.

2. It might not grow much but it still spits out mountains of cash, as a result in the last 12-ish years they've bought back almost half the company, the chances of them buying the whole thing back are not zero.; While I agree, there's a lot more to a stock than just the couple of metrics you showed. For example, how do you value the borderline cult mindset of apples followers? A couple years back and they'd buy a napkin if it had their logo on it. 

For me, it's just easier to stay away from Microsoft and Apple all together; Short Apple?  Sorry, you lost all credibility with that.; Apple does much bigger buybacks.; It’s even more grossly priced compared to Google; Google just blew out their cloud earnings. You see this as positive for MSFT or a sign of rising competition for Azure?; Both apple and Microsoft will be higher in stock price in 12 months. Buy and hold both, its a long term, sum game.; Short it then; Don't forget nancy sold her microsoft shares; I mean u can do the same for TSLA with any megacap. But do u want to short TSLA going into earnings? I don’t think so judging from last week; So buy $445 calls on microsoft?; Now do Tesla; Just a reminder, prior to the close of the Activision Blizzard deal finalizing, AAPL's iPhone Business generated roughly $40B while all of MSFT's businesses together generated $56B.

Here's a secret, buy them *both*. Those are my 2 largest single stock holdings and I still buy to this day.; From a personal standpoint: Apple has a level of consumer trust that is not matched for me by any other tech brand.

Google’s search has gone to shit. Microsoft has started throwing shady ads for its AI on my login screens and comes up with feature like ‘what if we just grabbed screenshots of your PC at random’. Meta is…. well, called *Meta* now despite the utter failure of the Metaverse, and I interact with its products as little as I can. Netflix got its content carved up when everyone else started their own streaming services and then cracked down on account sharing.

Apple… does what I need it to do. I got AirPods for the first time a while ago, and I was blown away by how convenient they were compared to most Bluetooth tech and the noise canceling was surprisingly good. I got a new iPhone recently, and I set it next to my old one and all my settings and info transferred over automatically. The most recent annoyance I’ve had with an Apple product is… removing the headphone jack? So, a complaint from like a decade ago.

Boeing looked good on paper for a long time. Boeing is on fire right now because they weren’t making a quality product. Say what you will about the relative financial side of the companies, or even the price/performance, but I don’t think anyone would say Apple isn’t making quality products.; Lmfao.

Shorting Apple as they are just about to unleash AI.

This is WSB level DD.; Wow I haven’t heard this one before on here; This is the worst analysis Ive seen all day.; You’re right, Apple is priced at roughly double what it should be. P/E ratios across the board are way too high. Not sure this means it won’t continue to outperform.; I remember every analyst screaming that msft will disappear around 2011  and I believe the price was around $25. Now everyone is screaming buy.; Interesting. Missing cash on hand comparison and the fact that while retail cares which genAI is better, the govt doesn’t. Govt will continue to force security compliance which translates to MS products. Govt and companies working govt contracts will elect MS over Apple based on security rather than outperformance; Bought the new AirPods 4 with ANC, absolutely amazing. I'm bullish af; I mean, that’s kind of their whole thing, and it’s working. I wouldn’t short them.; I’m pretty much all in on Apple and have been for years. I don’t see how comparing its financial metrics to Microsoft means that stock may see a hit. Personally dont think either of their AI offerings have much value long term.

Will continue to be all in on Apple until retirement.; I 100% agree. I wouldn't be entirely surprised to see a disappointment in earnings for Microsoft this quarter but I stark turn around across the following few years. The new AI supercycle is in the delivery of value to business, which mircosoft has put itself in position to deliver and the strongest and the most incumbent.; There is no reason not to hold both; apple has better accountants.; You invest in apple. Not trade apple; Apple stock is overvalued by a lot; Hopefully they just sell at least 240M handsets; What does Short Apple mean? I'm assuming long Microsoft is hold the stock; The hypothesis that one is marginally better than the other doesn’t lead to a good l/s setup.
I reckon u can find better co to short msft agst in a l/s setup; Apple’s historical revenue growth is “zero to flat”…? Are we talking about the same Apple?

What’s your definition of “historical”?; I can't cast a video to my smart TVs from a windows 11 pc without problems. I cast the video from the native player with repeat 1 enabled, it rewinds 4 seconds each time. I close the video player, reopen it, the connection gets glitched and does not release until I manually remove the device from bluetooth settings. Getting a new connection to the smart TV requires me to log off and back into my windows account.

Meanwhile, airplay just works. Remote display just works. I am a software developer with 10+ years IT experience. I can troubleshoot the connectivity issues in windows, but I can afford devices that just work at this point. Inexperienced users want their devices to just work by default.

Short MSFT.; Disagree. Long Apple, long Microsoft. Apple has a huge moat. People are locked into its ecosystem. No other company has access to the amount of personal data of individuals like Apple does. This is the goldmine. No matter how much Microsoft spends on AI, even if it permanently has AI 2 years ahead of Apple - it won’t have the personal data that Apple does.; Long GOOG, META  and AMZN

Sell APPL and MSFT  calls (not short); Operating profitability Apple, versus Operating Profitability Microsoft. There you go. Microsoft trades cheaper and is less profitable, Apple trades more expensive and is more profitable.; 

Apple does much bigger buybacks.; Their slow revenue growth isn't new and I'm willing to bet Apple has some crazy shit under their belt they've been working on to reverse the stagnation.; Your simple logic doesn’t apply to companies like apple. Way too many funds and investors just buy apple blindly without giving it a second thought and just buy more as soon as they see a dip. Apple is apple. Way too many eyes on it for it to shoot too much higher or lower than where it needs to be. The only downside there has ever been to apple since forever is that you can’t own enough of it.; Apple is going to own a huge piece of the AI space.  Go ahead and sell, I will continue to buy.; I didn’t listen to you on Costco and ended up watching it trade sideways while everyone and their mother was green.; Apple got left in the dust; Yeah you’re right the extra $100 BILLION in revenue since 2020 is flat to single digits 😂 get the fuck outta here; This should be a topic for r/ETFs considering how stable Apple is; These are interesting points, but I'm not into leveraged guesses. The markets are too finicky short-term and have too many unknowns long-term.; The fact that their P/E ratios are about the same undermines this entire argument.; Can't compare a tech company vs a fashion company.; I’m happy to see: Nvidia, Costco and Microsoft you being bullish on; Apple is grossly over priced compared to oranges; Good analysis. What you missed is that Apple is a semi-cult, similar to Tesla. The valuation of its stock price and PE reflects that - it's how people perceive Apple and their products and not the underlying numbers of their sales that count. 

It's easier to see that from outside US perspective where Apple products are not seen as anything special and many prefer other solutions (PC/Microsoft and Android). With the exception of a few northern countries in the EU that is.; What kind of comparison is that with “Earnings growth”? 15-20% vs “low double digits”? What does that mean? Anything between 10-14% can be said as “low double digits”, it’s not really that far off from 15-20%.; Apple would release the thousandth Iphone and there will still be people buying it; Compare to Google now lol

Apples ""super cycle"" is just like ""AI will kill search"", both are great narratives. But they're just narratives, no data to actually back up these claims.; Compare to Google now lol

Apples ""super cycle"" is just like ""AI will kill search"", both are great narratives. But they're just narratives, no data to actually back up these claims.; Never had Apple (besides indirectly through ETF's) and never will, hate the brand and do not believe in its future.  
Imo it lives off of the fact that too many poor people think buying an Apple makes them look rich which gives it some sort of a luxury status in comparison to Android phones.

I see it as a failed tech luxury brand with a bad quality to price ratio.  
Would I short it?  
Hell no, especially not with a growing middle class in the developing worlds.; While I agree that Apple is lagging severely in innovation, I just don’t see the need to pair trade this with MS.

Microsoft is a completely different animal - mostly B2B vs Apple mostly B2C.

Apple’s flopped a lot recently - failed car, failed headset, underwhelming AI,money losing TV streaming - but  it doesn’t really make a dent in the iPhone cash machine.; Congrats you got killed, I bought Microsoft longs today at 405 tho, so I’m betting on the upside with you; Apple builds amazing products while Microsoft hasn’t built anything meaningful for years.; Both are ridiculously expensive compared to Google.

Google even before the blow out quarter has made more money than Apple and Microsoft.

They are growing faster.   But have a PE that is 33% less than them.

I just finished listening to the call and finally Sundar is being smart.

He suggested that there could be unintentional consequences from the trial in terms of America leading with AI.

I never understood why Google did not play this card harder.  To me it is a winning strategy for them.; MSFT has higher potential than AAPL, I get it. 
Long MSFT and short AAPL, I can’t get it.; A; Just like their products…; TLDR:

Lmao. Gtfo. ; I agree and have for some time wondered what drove the need to update a working phone for one that also works? I do enjoy my iPad and have no hate for apple but is does seem over priced compared to other stocks; Bc it’s not filth. Any other questions?; I think your spot on and I would definitely bet on MSFT long term. As much as I would like love to, i wouldn't bet against Apple long term. I think you are 100% correct but I feel like somehow Apple will release an I-something that will get a pile of overdue features or copy features from other manufacturers and it will somehow be praised  as a revolution rivaling the second coming of Christ and cause share prices to skyrocket.; I see Apple's overall market share steadily shrinking; it lacks the moat that Microsoft does - especially for international expansion. Indonesia just banned the selling of iPhones due to Apple not following the law about how to produce them. China is seeing fast dropping demand - and I don't see them making more inroads in India, Brazil, Japan, South Korea - they just have too much competition and are too caught up in international trade geopolitics.; He's saying doing a pairs trade.   You short 100 shares of aapl at 230 to collect 23k.   You use that to buy msft, roughly 53 shares.   

If msft goes up 5% and aapl 2%, you sell your msft, buy back your aapl and keep the profit.   

The way you lose if aapl goes up higher than msft.; People have iPhones in their pocket; Put; Buybacks also reduce cash on the balance sheet. They’re not magic and the company isn’t doing long-term shareholders any favours by buying back at overvalued levels.; The float reduction has had nominal impact. It's about 3% a year. Adding to that, the equity value is reduced by the cash displaced, so the math isn't quite that simple either.; Why not just own both and don’t trade it? Not having exposure to either or even missing out on exposure via index funds would miss out on big gains.; How’s the $20 display polishing cloth? Pretty close to a napkin. https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MW693AM/A/polishing-cloth; What you are saying is meaningless as the OPs rambling about value based on 4 metrics.

How much did Apple return to their shareholders vs how much MSFT did? 

One returned 3% over the LTM, and one returned less 1% in terms of buybacks and dividends.

If you want to argue that is low returns based on current yields, sure, but your point on cult is utterly moronic since Apple ownership is passive- retail at any level don’t move the needle; nothing moves the needle. Its a 2.5T company that generates 100B+ in FCF. The premium is passive investing plus quality similar to most mega cap; They would walk around with a dildo up their asses if there was their logo on it.; Apple people buy Apple products, but that means very little if their revenue growth is slow. Apple is a wonderful business, but drastically mispriced.; ITT: r/stocks learns about pair trading; A long-short position is a bet in the spread/price changes between two equities. It profits if the spread of positions increases (long gaining value relative to the short) and loses money if vice versa. It is not a bet on the nominal value of Apple or Microsoft individually over time. I should've been more clear. 

The recommendation is not a bet that Apple will go down. It's a bet that Apple will go down relative to Microsoft.; Which is a very bad thing. It means they don't know how to invest in growth; Microsoft's financial/market position is better than Apple's, but Apple has much stability than Google. No wonders here.; Azures only moat is companies moving their aging Windows infrastructure to the cloud.  It's absolutely worthless when docker exists though; managing docker containers dynamically across multiple servers is becoming trivial, so what value does MSFT add outside of sticker shock for what they charge for things like basic storage?; Yeah - post the positions rather than just say iT iS OvERvaLueD and PE and buffet indicator and incoming recession and China invasion and yada yada; Only DD I need to know; Nancy continues to prove why she is the goat; OP should try shorting NVDA and COST which are much higher multiples; Irs going to 500; I think it's a lot harder to price things where the valuation is based on a vision that's so far out and claims by a CEO that can't be verified.; Besides general consensus getting the election wrong (as at this point, Elon's tied deeply with you know who), the only thing that's going to get this company to turn around at this point stock price wise is going to be another bear market by the Nasdaq.

What I described would likely even just be a short term whack.; The Guh dude from WSB needs a sequel. Just gotta make sure to stay within personal risk tolerance!; > about to unleash AI

Oh. This AI thing to phones is new? My phone has auto corrected for years. My phone has auto organized photos by event and location for years. Face ID has worked well for years. It has transcribed voicemails.

 But they real AI unleash is coming y’all; They already released it aaaaand, no one cares.; Apple has been getting a lot of criticism from outlets for their AI offerings being really underwhelming, or just being a more time consuming way of doing things you can already do. Worse yet, a lot of the AI functionality isn't even going to be available on the next iPhone when it starts selling.

I've seen some surveys to on consumers who are planning on buying the next iPhone. Apple's AI promises are barely even mentioned as the reason. The top reason mentioned is better battery life than their old phone.; Guess we'll see, won't we; Outperformed on both top and bottom lines.; There is if you want to remain market neutral with a pair trade; What he explained in other comment is that you make a bet on Microsoft going higher compared to Apple. It’s not the usual short as betting a decline on nominal value.; I don't think the difference is marginal and I think the nice thing is they're tied to opposites sides of the same GenAI coin.; Last 3 years. Fair point.; Apple makes better hardware and a better OS too. Both of those represent a tiny fraction of Microsoft's business.; MSFT isn't really a consumer business outside of Xbox.; For what it's worth, I never asked anyone to short Costco :). I recommended buying put spreads, which had between 50-80% upside for sideways trading. Even spreads simply betting Costco wouldn't go up over 950 had 20% upside.

Those buying naked puts would have been in meh shape too. My specific bet was that Costco would underperform the market by 5% just like here, and it already has!; I was referring to a shorter time horizon. But time for a math lesson. You're right, since June 2020, TTM revenue is up over $100B, from 273B to 385B.

That equates to a growth rate of almost exactly 9% per year. Welcome to the wonderful world of math and compounding!; Huh? Nothing he's talking about is related to an ETF.; Due to compounding a 5-10% growth rate difference is indeed massive. It depends on the year of reference, but you can look up the year or time frame that is most representative to you. With Reddit, you can't win. If I say 3 years, folks will say I'm cherrypicking, why not 5? Safer to provide a range over the last few years!; I opened my position last week. At current after hours pricing, I'm exactly flat as both have declined almost exactly equally, while the market is down 1%. Give it a month and I'll eat my words.; Spoken like a true consumer who has no idea that Microsoft is mostly a B2B company and Azure is one of its greatest products of all time.; Agreed. But the reasons for that premium are due to uncertainty/overhead in the anti-trust rulings and uncertainty about how GenAI will impact Search long term. Both things that are likely being over-emphasized but not the key theme of this analysis.; Why do people buy new cars? They all do the same thing.; Sorry I’m not familiar with this. How does shorting 100 aapl shares get you 23k?; The market can still remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.; People are reading this on thier iPhone, while Apple is getting a piece from every paid app on their phone.   Apples fine.; Here Nokia; Yes perfect time to short apple big investors have been selling over last months only dumb retail money is buying; The CAPEX only matters if they more fit the stock than it’s worth which hasn’t proven to be true yet; A) I do have exposure through index funds. But when I say ""stay away"" I mean I won't put active effort into them. I own plenty of VFV (Canadian version of VOO), but I don't do anything to manage that it just sits there.

B) for the people that don't want to just invest in index funds - sure you could miss out on big gains, but you could also miss out on big losses (or even bigger gains from other stocks). The past has no indication of the future so who is to say if these stocks will go up? If you believe one of them is massively overvalued would you really want exposure to that stock?; Thats all I’ve done for 4 years. I’m up 42%; Some people want alpha I suppose lol; Past performance is no indicator for future performance. Valuation matters and if it doesn't now it will in the future. Always has been like this for every stock on this planet.; >your point on cult is utterly moronic since Apple ownership is passive- retail at any level don’t move the needle; nothing moves the needle. Its a 2.5T company that generates 100B+ in FCF. The premium is passive investing plus quality similar to most mega cap

I'm not talking about the share price, I'm talking about their hoards of people lined up waiting to buy the newest iPhone no matter the lack of innovation. If you're too dense to understand how non-monetary factors like brand work, then don't call people morons. 

I don't give a shit about #s because if I actually tried to find their valuation, I wouldn't be posting it on reddit. All I'm saying is OP can't look at a couple of numbers and conclude God's work from it.; I mean they are the basic valuation metrics. On long-term fundamentals, valuation is just a function of free cash flows projected into the future over the discount rate. And net margin and growth rate are the two simplest proxies for future FCF. 

To call these valuation metrics pointless would be to not have any basis to discuss valuations at all.; it's funny and sad at the same time

not because people don't know (I didn't explicitly), but because OP literally said ""spread bets""... people just can't read; Gotcha.  That makes significantly more sense and I wouldn’t disagree.  Based on fundamentals I would also agree that Microsoft SHOULD outperform Apple but I’m not sure how valid a fundamentals based approach is anymore.; How do you put this position in place? Long 1 share / short 1 share, or long $1 / short $1 ?; Or it means they make a metric fuck load of money and can’t invest all of it; While I’m not a fan of Apple’s scale of buybacks, buybacks are not inherently bad. That said, I completely agree with you in that Apple can be better capitalizing on growth avenues than going for bigger and bigger repurchase programs.; Or they have way too much cash and don’t know what to do with it because they literally cannot invest it all; Finance 101 take; You realize that a while back, Apple didn’t DO buybacks but agreed to only because shareholders demanded it? They’re not throwing 10s of billions at buybacks because they can’t think of anything better to do; they were dragged to the table.; ? Google has the perception of being a volatile business maybe, but if you actually analyzed the business performance over the last few decades, Google has performed way better than AAPL... Grew it's revenues, margin, profit and fcf an order of magnitude more than AAPL in the last 5/10 years. 

Does ""stable"" just mean lower growth to you? Google has very stably been synonymous with the internet for over a decade and I don't see that changing. Assuming you mean the regulation risk?; Yup puts gonna print; 😂; I think and tell people about this all day. Apple does not grow at all and thus does not deserve this high PE. Maybe 25 is more reasonable.; I think your analysis is pretty spot on, except you forgot one big thing. The Google monopoly case could cost Apple over $20 billion of almost pure profit annually, because of the courts ruling that Google paying to be the default search engine was illegal monopolistic behavior that stifles competition in the search market.

That's over 8% of their TTM revenue, and 20% of their TTM net income.

I own shares of AAPL, but I trimmed my position months ago, and have been seriously contemplating trimming it again, or even exiting it entirely.; Is aapl a short agst qqq for you?; Just a joke about how stable apple’s price is considering he’s suggesting to short it; I’ll be looking to get out of some of my calls in the am if I can close up, bought 6k worth looking to close around 8k; Azure is an okay product, making them a lot of money. But in the face of AWS and Google Cloud. It is neither innovative nor competitive.; I think the GenAI search impact one has lesson a lot as people now realize that is ridiculous.

But the other one has grown.   Which is kind of silly because a broken up Google would be worth a lot more.

But there is next to zero chance that happens.

The more likely resolution will hurt Apple a lot and likely help Google.

A screen when you turn on your phone to have you select your search will mean Google no longer pays and gets majority of the users still.; You’re selling 100 shares at 230/share. 

100 * 230 =23,000; I recently heard how companies and apps should pay royalties to Apple because without the iPhone their businesses wouldn’t exist

So yea you can short them but also maybe the market recognizes their true value.

Edit: no one can predict the future, only manage risk. Do as you will; Reading this on my iPhone   while watching apple tv+ on my Apple TV after logging out of my work MacBook that I use while listening to my HomePod while taking meetings with my AirPods. 


I’d never bet against Apple personally. 

Eta: I forgot my Apple watch too. Though it’s a few years old model wise because they removed the oxygen sensor; I’m reading it on my IPAD; I haven’t paid for an app in years. Who even does that anymore.; Idk if he was going at you in bad faith or can't correctly read but your points are clear. I'd say Apple is still a very valuable stock because of your point on branding and how they wield consistency to their advantage. That and they have a closed ecosystem of expensive products that all work hand and hand with one another. Also not to mention all kinds of company deals that have exclusivity on Apple products use in their business which guarantees sales on their products regardless of innovation. That is also not to say Apple doesn't innovate. They take their time on purpose to maximize profit before they take a bigger swing. At the end of the day their business strategy is very sound and I'll keep investing unless something huge changes internally.; Out of all the stocks apple is a wild card. Similar to Tesla in a few respects. Its fan base is cultish and so are investors. You know they’re going to come out with some new ear pod or wearables and tank this plan. Timing will be hard. Plus stock buy backs and god knows what else is cooking.

People have been betting against apple for 30 years now and they always get burned.; Dollar for dollar. If you want leverage and believe in a large gap, there are more creative constructs (buy/sell opposing options or spreads) that have different return curves based on the gap.; Microsoft makes about the same or more? They could do the same?; Yeah. It's basic finance. That's why their growth is slower than say Microsoft which invests more heavily.; \> I don't see that changing.

The risk of that changing is growing. Regulation is a one thing.

The other thing is Microsoft master-stroke to distract Google from lucrative cloud business with OpenAI foray into internet search.

A fair share of Google's profit is coming from iPhone and that deal is not as sure as before.

Push for Waymo earlier than anticipated is a desire of Alphabet to show that they are diversifying, but it's more of a wishful thinking.

As an employee Google is not as attractive as 5/10 years ago (your timeline, but that's fine) and acquiring talent is a big deal.

Hope that makes sense.; I certainly wouldn’t do what he’s suggesting, but he’s really saying he wants to leverage Apple to buy Microsoft more than purely shorting Apple. He could have essentially chose any two companies in the world though, if you were going to do it, not sure why Apple would need to be the comparison.; Yep. All of the hyper-sophisticated procurement teams going with the Microsoft suite are a bunch of morons and you know better.; I was thinking in terms of options. Please disregard my idiocy.; This is hilarious because without Microsoft basically all modern businesses wouldn't exist. Almost all of them run off of windows, outlook and office, and a variety of other windows applications. In comparison iPhones are a slight convenience for most businesses. Some companies run off the Apple ecosystem but Microsoft is by far the bigger player here.; You probably have the watch too?; LMAO; No lie. The new HomePod looks pretty sweet.; Thanks!; Apple has higher R&D costs than MSFT, while MSFT has higher CapEx. Your argument only holds true for fixed assets. You are also comparing a software company and pure service provider to what is essentially a hardware company with software applications and services. Perhaps try to understand what you want to discuss before shooting blindly; I’m not saying that. They are a 3T company still. They make solid products. I just don’t think they are innovative.; Yeah right, but this is still small fragment of Microsoft's impact. Have you ever heard of Azure? Whole factories are working thanks to Microsoft's solutions. Then there are machines like devices in public transport to TVs in McDonald's, guess what is there... Meanwhile Apple makes mobiles and laptops, wow.; Businesses run on Intel as well yet their stock over the past decade is down 30%; Oh fuck I do lmao and I refuse to subscribe to anything that I can’t subscribe to through Apple because I like having a single place to manage them and the easy cancellation.; When you're up against hyper-sophisticated procurement teams and trillion dollar competitors, you have to be innovative, competitive, or cheap. They are not cheap. Look into the latest advancements here.; I am a software engineer that uses the full Microsoft development stack including Visual Studio, .NET, Azure Devops, and Azure. So yeah I am aware. As far as I know Azure has actually overtaken AWS as the leader in cloud. Microsoft owns a big chunk of the video game industry as well, and if they ever figure out how to put a dent into Google's search market share they will literally own the world.; Sounds undervalued OR the stocks above are overvalued. What does your gut and analysis tell you?; Oh, right, I did that for Disney+ also. I absolutely love Apple’s ability to be able to view and cancel the recurring billings, especially from dodgy app developers who try to scam you with a massive $100+ annual subscription after your one week trial is over.; > Azure has overtaken AWS

I don’t think that’s true, where did you hear that; It depends on how you measure it... AWS has slightly higher market share, but Azure has slightly higher revenue. Quarterly revenue for AWS is 26 billion, Azure is 28 billion. I can't find reliable sources on profit though, unfortunately.; No doubt Azure is growing a lot, but it might not be Apples to Apples comparison.

This is quote from an article that also talked about the 28 billion revenue reported by Microsoft:

”It is key to note that Microsoft does not provide exact Azure sales figures to the public. Instead, Microsoft combines Azure, SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio, Nuance, GitHub, Microsoft Partner Network, and enterprise and partner services, all under its Intelligent Cloud umbrella.”"
Apple announces new and smaller Mac Mini with first redesign since 2010,"Apple announced on Tuesday new Mac Mini models, featuring the first major redesign since 2010 that makes the desktop computer significantly smaller.

Aside from a redesign that shrunk the case and reduced the computer’s volume in half, the main upgrade on these new computers is that they include Apple’s latest chip, either the M4, or a more powerful version called the M4 Pro.

The Mac Mini is Apple’s least-expensive Mac, starting at $599, and does not include a display, which is sold separately. When the product line was first introduced in 2008, it was marketed as a computer for people switching from Microsoft Windows who could simply plug their existing keyboard, mouse and monitor into their new silver box.

The Mac Mini is not one of Apple’s highest-volume computers in terms of sales, but it is an important slot in Apple’s lineup, especially for people who make apps for iPhones and other Apple platforms. Many iPhone developers like to run a Mac Mini as a personal development server for coordinating uploads and code.

One improvement in the new design is that all of the ports are USB-C ports, the same more modern offering found on Apple’s laptops. There are three USB-C ports on the rear and two on the front, a new addition that will make it easier to plug or unplug accessories while the computer rests on a desk.

Apple said in a press release that the M4 is a significant improvement over the M2 chip in the previous version released in 2022. Graphics and games are more than twice as fast, and the M4 can support up to 14 CPU cores and 20 GPU cores, an increase over the past generation. Apple first introduced the M4 in May in Apple’s iPad Pro.

Apple is framing the new Mac Minis, like all of its new products announced this year, as built for Apple Intelligence, the company’s artificial intelligence system released this week. Apple has said a forthcoming integration of ChatGPT into writing fields inside apps such as Word will allow users to generate and rewrite text and emails using the system.

However, unlike on the iPhone, where only phones released in the past two years will support Apple Intelligence, all of Apple’s computers with the M1 chip and newer since 2020 can run the company’s AI. 

Apple’s Mac family remains a large business segment even though it is less important to the company than the iPhone. In the June quarter, Apple reported $7 billion in Mac sales, up about 2% on an annual basis.

Apple’s chief marketer previously teased a “week of announcements.” The company unveiled new iMac computers on Monday, so it seems plausible more is coming. This week’s new Macs are likely Apple’s last major hardware announcements for the year.

Bloomberg’s estimates on the big four tech giants ,"The big four tech giants are expected to spend a record $56 billion in total capital expenditures in the third quarter, according to the average estimate of analysts aggregated by Bloomberg. Much of that spending will go to NVIDIA and other AI-related device makers, with further increases expected in the coming quarters.
All signs point to continued strong AI-related spending. From chip device maker Asmax (ASML.US) to TSMC (TSM.US), AI has been a big part of this earnings season.
That backdrop has pushed NVIDIA shares higher, while Chief Executive Jen-Hsun Huang has assured that production of its new Blackwell chips is going well and demand is strong. NVIDIA is the biggest beneficiary of the big investment in artificial intelligence computing devices. The stock hit an all-time high last week and now has a market capitalization of about $3.5 trillion, slightly less than Apple (AAPL.US), which is still the world's most valuable company.
To be sure, there are concerns about the big tech companies' spending on artificial intelligence, as investors believe the billions of dollars these companies are investing are generating relatively little revenue. As such, this will be another focus of attention this week when these companies report earnings.
You have to walk the fine line of investing,“ said Paul Marino, chief revenue officer at Themes ETFs, ‘so that investors understand that you're ’not going too far”.
Nvidia's revenue is expected to more than double this year to $125.6 billion, according to the average forecast of analysts compiled by Bloomberg. Next year, the chipmaker's fiscal year 2026, sales are expected to grow 44 percent to $181 billion.
Of course, there are other companies benefiting from high AI spending, including Broadcom, Ultra Micro Computer and Dell Technologies.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ge79db/bloombergs_estimates_on_the_big_four_tech_giants/,37,"Oh another NVIDIA thread. Fantastic. 

$7 Trillion mc by Christmas.; I wonder which of the big tech companies will slow down spending first. Who will ""blink"" first to slow down.  

I have a feeling it will be amazon 😅; Is AI actually helping end customers? Like Coca-Cola or Wal-Mart

I have seen zero evidence; It’s interesting to see these companies going all-in on AI as the engine for their next growth phase, but the ROI might take a while to materialise and investors are eager for immediate results. 

If AI costs weren’t so high, it wouldn’t be as much of an issue - but the expenditure is insane. Quite the conundrum!! NVIDIA is positioned perfectly to take advantage.; Ultra micro? Do they mean Supermicro?; Isn't this somewhat obvious?... But when will they decide to cut back? That is the question; 4 Trillion seems in the bag, and I wouldn't rule out 5 trilly

Right company. Right place. Right time.; NVDA holders dream  lol; What about OpenAI and Anthropic. How much do they spend on Nvidia hardware compared to Google, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon?

Then, you also have to think about actual nation states. Countries that feel that they need to have their own AI models that keep up with the pace of everybody else, otherwise it could be a huge security risk, for any of their adversaries; [deleted]; Compared to other giants 
Amazon is really different; Maybe it’s just a slogan; Yeah; Maybe; I think openAI uses Azure for their LLMs and don't build out their own data centers. And same with Anthropic and, AWS, I think. So I don't think they build out their own data centers. 

Countries, though. Yeah, they will probably build their own AI models.; I’m not sure on the international market. There are export restrictions on the best AI servers and the European allies don’t like to pay for anything.; Meta is the least likely, it’s fully controlled by Zuck and he’s betting big on AI; Yeah; >And same with Anthropic and, AWS

Open a second account? Not sure If there is a benefit ,"I just hit 100k in my portfolio with 52% in SP500 (all VOO) and now interested in switching to go heavier in dividend stocks. My portfolios other holdings are “safe” TSLA, AMZN, MSFT, AAPL…The two dividend stocks I’m holding are monthly paid dividend all reinvested, (SCM, GLAD) earning me $20 and change a month each and have not lost capital. For some reason my mind is telling me to open a new brokerage account dedicated to only dividend and let my 100k sit dormant, is there any upside to this or is the same as putting money in my current account just reallocate the automatic funds from going to VOO into the dividend stocks. Still kind of hesitant to stop investing in the SP all together. I have a ROTH that is maxed out every year and contribute 6% to my 401k with a 4% company match.

Scroll to the bottom. TSLA is #12; Numbers wise, there is no difference between opening a new account or keeping your dividend stocks in the same account.

Just a matter of organization really.; There's no impact from having money in different accounts. There's also nothing special about hitting 100k, and no expected benefit from favoring dividend paying assets.; It’s cleaners but that’s the only reason. I do this on a few of my accounts for the reason you are talking about. Most people just refer to it as OCD. One thing to note is that it makes compiling the info for taxes more annoying and slightly more costly.; When I hit 100k I didn't really see any reason to change my investing strategy. It's a milestone, and good for you in reaching it, but it seems a bit of a arbitrary point to change your strategy. As for opening a new account? It really comes down to whatever you feel comfortable managing. I'd personally just stick with one account myself. God luck however you decide to proceed!; A concern that might argue for a second account might be around any operational issues at a given firm that makes it difficult to get access to funds that you might need (or trade, deposit, etc.). Investment firms can suffer security breaches as an example. Or profitability issues. In both cases your accounts should be safe but it could be impactful if you can't withdraw funds to pay your bills, etc. But this argues both accounts would be more ""generic""; not specialized by type of  investment or investment horizon, etc.

Motif Investing and Folio had failures with the accounts ending up at Interactive Brokers (2020 time frame) after multiple acquisitions that seemed a bit messy and I imagine accounts were unavailable for short periods of time: [https://accessipos.com/motif-investing-what-happened/](https://accessipos.com/motif-investing-what-happened/); I think it would make sense to open a separate account for dividends, this is what I do, and use about 10% of margin if your dividends and growth rate pays off margin percentage.; Can you expand on that? Why would that matter? And not all brokers support consolidation of margin accounts since that's a relatively new interpretation of rule 4210. So at most brokers - that simply reduces margin bp.; If you are investing in dividends and holding longer, using margin and trading on the same account periodically, then it would be very hard to manage margin money. In some cases you can’t buy stocks only using margin and some brokers require put your own money at least 50%.
So, in order to make sure your investments are not messy, in sense where your margin goes, it is better to have different accounts for different strategies.; So basically - your point is that it's simply an organizational reason. It does require accounts at different brokers in many cases.

I'm not sure that I entirely agree with your idea since it limits available margin for trading and implies that a trader isn't able to manage margin properly.

But I can agree that someone that doesn't have the experience or skills to manage margin can benefit from segregated accounts.

>some cases you can’t buy stocks only using margin and some brokers require put your own money at least 50%. 

That's kind of the definition of margin. So I don't consider that a benefit of segregated accounts.

fwiw - I have 2 taxable separate pm accounts at the moment which ended up that way for no good reason other than I hadn't gotten around to consolidating them. But it's incredibly inefficient from a margin perspective.; Well, once if you start actively using margin you will end up having a problem how to manage to make sure that you pay less fees or make sure you want have margin calls and so on. I am just sharing my own experience and this may not apply to you as we both have different strategies."
How do I choose investment ratio between individual shares?,"I invest mostly in index funds and small part in individual stocks (let say 20%).

I want to split this between GOOGL, AAPL and MSFT (it's not a fixed list, it can change to non-tech share also in the future)

So as each stock moves, by its average normal daily amount, it has an equal chance to impact your current portfolio the same.

For example if you bough a very stable stock that moved a little each day and a much more erratic stock with large moves per day, if your weighting was by volatility parity, you would expect each stocks move a day, to impact your portfolio profit/loss by roughly the same dollar amount.

Eg stock x moved up 10% today I made $500.
      Stock y moved up 2% today I made $500

Hope that helps; If your index holdings are anything like market weight those 3 companies are already your 1st, 2nd, and 4th largest holdings. If you want to also have individual shares in those it means you think they are undervalued by the market. If you dedicated 20% of your portfolio to those 3 stocks in addition to what you'd already have in funds you'd be holding them something like 4x market weight. Do you really expect them to perform that much better?

Should I move money from my Apple savings into stocks too, or is it smart to have just in the savings account? The thing is, if I move after graduation I may need some of my money, but I may not.

Invest 15% of your income. Open a Roth IRA and invest in a low cost index fund (such as VOO) and in a speculative growth stock like NVDA (they are leading the AI boom). Don't touch this for 20 years. If you must withdraw before you're 59 1/2, you can withdraw your contribution. Don't touch your growth.

Keep 5% of your income in another High Yield Savings Account for donations/gifts. Use this during the holidays, etc.

Keep 5% in another HYSA for fun money and simple splurges.

Keep 5% in another HYSA for planned large purchases. Such as a car, house, etc.

The remaining 60% is your lifestyle spending. Keep the checking account as is. You'll need it.

How long have you had your brokerage account? Don't touch it if less than 1 year. You'll be taxed on the gain either way but if you withdraw after 1 year then you're taxed as an investor (as opposed to being taxed as income). If you don't need the money, just leave it.

With a traditional brokerage account, you are taxed with the money you contribute and taxed on the gains when you withdraw.
With a Roth IRA, the money you use has already been taxed. But your gains are not taxed after age 59 1/2.

Berkshire Hathaway as proxy cash holding?,"Disclaimer: I don't hold any BRK at this time (because I own A LOT of Apple).

* Cash grows \~5% per year.

   * adjusted drop 7%.
* BRK cash grows \~5% per year, which is 1.5% of their total holdings.
   * adjusted drop 5.5%.
* BRK gets \~5B USD in dividends every year, which is 0.5% of their total holdings: adjusted drop 5%

Now, with a loss of 5%, BRK maybe realize some losses in order to offset capital gains, which would bring the actual loss even lower, let's say it drops another 0.5%, which makes the loss 4.5%.

Now, if BRK's holdings drop 4.5% and let's say you need to take 30% of the money from it:  
\- Now, BRK will buy more of their holdings.  
\- In order to recover the 4.5% of the 30% of the original money you've taken, the stock only needs to recover \~7% (which is not a lot, considering it just dropped 10%).

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Greenlight Capital’s David Einhorn thinks Peloton  could trade as high as $31.50 a share if the company slashes costs, which could double its current adjusted EBITDA projections, CNBC has learned.  That’s about five times the current price of its shares, which were trading around $6.20 midday on Friday. 


Only know of him because he had a large stake in Green Brick Partners (GRBK) and he made a ton off of that. ; Anyone get moved to Schwab this year and know how to get realized capital gain/loss from the first part of the year when you were at TD? The statements don’t have it; Lots of knee jerk scoffing and ranting about the TPR/CPRI merger block.

Sure, at the most superficial level it sounds funny to care about two fashion brands merging.

But if you read the actual case, and FTC’s mandate, then it’s quite clear why they were right to pursue it and why every qualified panel and judge who has looked it at in careful detail agreed wholeheartedly.


It’s not just about having choice and capitalist consumerism for handbags or jackets.  And it’s not *just* about protecting the interests of the employees, tenants, suppliers, and co-retailers.

It’s about blocking the deliberate and patent creation of a exploitive monopoly, something thag is in FTCs mandate to prevent.  And by doing so, with unanimous confirmation by every qualified expert, it sends a proactive message to other corrupt opportunist in any sector or business who might have wanted to try their luck at flouting our anti-monopoly laws.  

Some who understand this deeper reasoning may still complain that truly big monopolies or oligopolies are not being held to account as strictly.  But a properly functioning FTC has to prioritize winning cases along with going up against behemoths who will go to any lengths.  FTC winning some cases establishes good precedent and acts as a deterrent.; Ath we back !!

You already have battles on the ground being coordinated in multiple countries.” Strong words. I don't know if I agree with them but there are definitely shifts underneath the surface of everyday life that are making me feel like something big is coming. The social and geopolitical shifts remind me of the lead up and early days of WW1 and WW2 but thankfully it seems like most countries understand they have too much to lose, primarily the big dogs US and China, to take that next step. Most except Russia, Iran, and NK. I'm definitely keeping a close eye there. US and China have their shadow war, but Russia and Iran have already gone kinetic and keep escalating.; Oddly bullish leading into the election.

More money lost sitting on the sideline than in actual bear markets.; Doesnt sound too risky tbh. Microsoft is a mini ETF.; I don’t understand this approach personally, putting 30% in a single company like this, especially a company like MSFT at this stage, which although pretty safe I don’t find it a compelling investment. I think there’s a decent chance of moderate outperformance of VOO, and a decent chance of underperforming, and very little chance of vastly outperforming. If I were going to buy MSFT, it would be one of my safety plays, not a bet on particularly good returns. 

I think psychologically its a bad idea to choose only one stock also. Is it worth the negatives which also include missing out on alternative investments, and being so attached to the fortunes of a single company. If it’s 2% or even 5% and it’s not moved after a year or two or even down a little, well you can live with that, but with 30% that wouldn’t be nice to underperform even VOO with that percentage over that time. And it may lead you to make rash emotional decisions in the future.; Ah shit this is going to escalate into a war again isn’t it; Well that was mighty nice of them to wait till the markets close.

I've been holding for a while now and those earnings weren't bad to me by any means, but understand the pullback since the stock is up a ton this year.

However, the fundamentals are still not crazy expensive for the company.

One thing for a lot these type of businesses is the importance of the backlog and it's still pretty strong. From the ER from earnings.

>Backlog as of September 30, 2024 was $5.68 billion as compared to $5.77 billion as of June 30, 2024 and $4.29 billion as of September 30, 2023. On a same-store basis, backlog increased from $4.29 billion as of September 30, 2023 to $5.17 billion as of September 30, 2024.

>Mr. Lane continued, “Backlog continues far above the levels of the prior year and bookings were remarkable even as we are burning through work at a record pace, with same-store revenue higher by 18% on a quarterly basis, and by 23% year-to-date, compared to the prior year. Entering the fourth quarter, same-store backlog is 21% higher than it was at this time last year, and we are experiencing unprecedented strength in our pipelines. Considering these advantages and given the confidence we have in our unmatched workforce, we expect continued strong results in the fourth quarter and in 2025.”

Also kind of concerning around NK sending actual troops to the war as well. 

[https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/north-korean-troops-russia-ukraine-fair-game-us-putin-rcna176989](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/north-korean-troops-russia-ukraine-fair-game-us-putin-rcna176989); This dude is always a doomer man, he been calling for recession since 2021; Status quo is always preferred by business.

Always do your DD, but I think $AMKR is still really cheap at it's currents levels. What makes excited about the company is that they do advanced packaging for microchips and are currently building out a factory in AZ to help support Apple.

This ties into the the fact that TSMC just announced the yield for their chips in the AZ plant is 4% higher, which could mean that TSMC will continue to want to build out more in AZ/US. 

Also TMSC announced they will be working with them as well:

The other thing to note is that there isn't a ton of companies that do that in the US.; You basically have to look at the bottom of those what are the best stocks threads. Or what stocks you think will outperform threads. That most downvoted stocks on this sub tends to be the answer.

CVNA was one of those stocks now it up 50x in 2 years.; Im using this dip to get back in. I bought the stock after an earnings dip in April 2024. And the stock stayed down until July 2024 sold last week over fears from Hurricane Helene didnt want to hold through earnings.

Earnings came out that they werent impacted much by Helene but stock still tanked. So loading the boat hope it falls under $400 agan.; I love how the market not going up for one day is considered strange.; It pumped on bad data, maybe that's just being digested now. Who knows; Maybe you know this and maybe you don’t, but those reports are always revised and no secret goblins are secretly creating fake secret numbers that wouldn’t fool or influence anyone anyway.  

That’s just the nature of how that reporting process is.

___

Edit: on the off chance someone else wants to know why jobs reports get revised, it’s because the initial report is based on best estimates from employers of their hiring plans, and the revisions reflect more the actual hires that took effect.  One is more timely.  The other is more accurate, but lagged.

They are always revised.  And the revisions tend to follow patterns related to phases of the cycle, and can sometimes inflect.  So there’s no reason why you would expect them to alternate like a coin toss.  It’s very typical for there to be a series of downward revisions in a sequence or a series of upward revisions in a sequence.  There’s no boogeyman hacking the numbers for some vague and mysterious purpose.

Someone knowing that can protect themselves from being tricked by certain hoax sources who try to create undue division and paranoia with conspiracies.; Bad economic data = real. 

Good economic data = fake. 

Downward revisions = real. 

Upward revisions = fake. 



This kind of stupidity getting upvoted on an investing subreddit is pretty astounding.; What was the bad data today?; Bad news is good news w interest rates back like an ex; It's only been the biggest market cap stock since 2011.; Debating with myself in terms of buying Nextracker before or after earnings 😅; So TSLA and ABNB underperformed the S&P.; Woah, you're making money while every stock in existence is going up. Bravo! It must definitely be because you inversed Reddit and not because it's a bull market.; Why did Reddit hated UBER so much. I didnt really check out the UBER threads on this sub.; What's NVDA return?; The cool thing about TA is it could be whatever you want it to be.; [Sure, why not?](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/technical_analysis_2x.png); Not yet, it's holding the $140 range. If it declines from here, yes I'd call it a double top. If it breaks higher, blue sky breakout.; No, it's been holding 140 and looks like it's breaking out. 

Also, massive call buying about 10 million dollars in a single trade has NVDA 170 for Dec; Someone here accurately described Nvidia as a casino that's no longer trading on fundamentals. Instead, its price movement is being dictated by massive options volume that's inflating IV. 

Right now the open interest for next week implies range-bound movement between $140 and $145. If it breaks above $145, the next big cluster is $150-152.5.

A double top on a price chart is only verified if the stock loses momentum and stalls out. Since options exposure is currently biased upwards, NVDA does not qualify.; lemme get my crayons; Wait until end of today. It if closes higher than the previous ATH is likely going to continue running more. If it closes below previous ATH it's murky and could the start of a reversal, but could also be gathering liquidity for the next move up.; Pffft I doubt it.  

If it breaks out it breaks out, no sense in getting all excited about it.  

Hope it drops below 100 so I can buy it.; It's a triple top monkey apparition. Probably gonna pump to the next inverted ghost level ($150).; WHAT?; Sure...as if Nov. 5 was just decided upon this morning; Something new in the past couple hours?; 💀; But the PE lol; I agree for the most part but tech is just such a monster with national security becoming a priority with AI advancement. Assuming no radical change at MS it should outperform VOO.

That being said youre probably right and I would recommend the QQQ for growth and extra tech exposure that single mom might be looking for.; Nope…right before. Go see ..rtx, lockheed, all slight pump around 7pm eastern.; It’s definitely not because it was right after midnight ME time and on the Friday, the day muslims have as Christians have Sunday. 0 IQ take; 🤦🏻‍♂️ wtf, I’m trying to calculate it myself and I’ve got so many trades…by the time the 1099 comes it will be too late to make the sales to balance out gains, thanks for responding; Yeah, he's scamming with known carcinogen instead, which is apparently, in reddit terms, much better than fake robots.; The panic got priced in in 2022 pretty much, you had oil spiking and defense stocks surging like you'd expect for the outbreak of a major war. I think for now, in terms of the markets, things should keep contained as long as NATO doesn't go into direct conflict with Russia or Iran. That's the kind of moment that would cause a shock reaction like the Ukraine invasion in 22 or when the NBA shutdown midgame in 2020; It's pretty clear at this point that Russia, Iran, and NK have a concrete alliance going. China is also amenable to working with them when there's mutual benefit but doesn't want to upturn everything in the same way thankfully, they prefer the long game of building influence while undermining the US's until they are strong enough to project force. I now firmly believe that Iran and its proxies coordinated and were supplied by russia before october 7th and through to today in exchange for Iran supplying Russia those Shahed drones. There is a significant risk that Russia or Iran miscalculate and do something that ends up pulling NATO troops in directly. We're already seeing some additional US troops going to Israel, and Ukraine obviously has a ton of NATO support on basically everything except boots on the ground. Seems like a tinderbox these days.; Stocks did get pretty roughed up in 22, not to the point of a recession but a significant pullback (though not really because of macro but because of a black swan). He's not like an oracle or anything, but he's seen a lot and he did a great job running JPM through the 08 crisis through to today so I pay attention to his takes.; Definitely maybe.


The guy wins, he's kinda volatile, so I'd see some volatility.

The gal wins, the guy was a bit of a sore loser last time, so I'd see some volatility.


And global events could also do all sorts of crap... feels powder-keg-y; It’s an operator for oil fields and the oil price is beaten down. But given the recent tensions in the Middle East, I’d say it’s going higher on Monday. Also, it’s one of the largest operators in the US and side trump is projected to win, we’re drilling baby. And they literally make money on drilling; What do you think is the value of akmr; I am not sure if they are undervalued here but I am contemplating buying just a little bit too.; Yeah must just be a coincidence it's been 80%+ downwards revisions instead of anything close to 50 50.

Just a massive coincidence; What upward revisions? It's like 85 15 down and up split. It's been happening for a year straight.

If you DONT think this is shady then you have ZERO critical thinking skills.; Orders, durable goods, etc.; I think so, albeit the real benefit to inversing reddit is the time saved from having to research stock winners.; The TTM is above the returns I'm getting from my broad market ETF. I allocated heavily into ABNB and UBER, so right now the returns are only \~10% higher than the NASDAQ's returns, and \~20% higher than DJIA TR. My big regret is not hitting RDDT even harder.; Bad evaluation of Uber's cashflow, and general hate of the business model.

My scan is for a long time no one looked into how Uber, the stock, was theoretically ""unprofitable"" while the core Uber Mobility business was making billions in profit for years. tl;dr, Uber Technologies was a FCF / cash cow for years, but they aggressively amortized their assets, reinvested in the company, and then somewhat fictitiously claimed that meant they didn't make money.

People didn't look. They read what they wanted to hear ('Uber does not make money') and stopped when they got the answer they wanted.

[Uber is in deep shit. : r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/irnwlx/uber_is_in_deep_shit/)

I'm reluctant to include it because I first invested in NVIDIA in the 2021 meme craze era because of reddit. I understand NVIDIA then fell out of favor, but I leave that messy timeline alone.; How to lie with statistics; You've got to take into account the triple whipsawed half tea cup on the 32 second chart.  

Put in the Ad/Dx chart and you can see the uptrend pulling nicely into the downtrend.  

So what I'm saying is... you're right unless you're wrong.  

Thanks for reading, it's getting closer to noon here.; Nothing. It's not changing based on news.; No but we're like 10 days away, doesn't surprise me that the market is trading side ways when there's so much at stake with this election; Think of the positives, money will have no meaning anymore.  

You're all such downers.; And funnily bears almost always talk about TTM PE. As anyone gives a shit about past returns when a company is growing EPS double digits (in some cases triple digits).; That the robots were fake was not advertised, a packet of cigs will tell you that it will give you cancer.; Yeah, part of the reason why I lump China in there in particular, since we are talking mainly cold war, is the influence of TikTok and China pushing out anti-west rhetoric. Still feels like China wants to take Taiwan. It benefits them to for the war in the Ukraine to continue as well, since there is some issues with our ability to even produce ammunitions. 

I also talk about being bullish on ship building, because China's Navy has been building while we can't even build ships anymore. If a war breaks out with China/Taiwan, it will be critical to have more ships. 

I still find it so strange that NK sending physical troops isn't really a bigger issue.; ""A bit"" and ""kinda"" are doing a lot of heavy lifting here haha.; I try not to do that in a bull market. It works in a bear market being picky on entry points. I thought CAVA was overvalued at $80. Instead of selling I held and it went up another 70% this year.; I probably shouldn’t bother explaining that the reports are not the same as coin tosses, or that being credulous about obvious hoaxes is bad for your financial and other forms of health.; The last jobs report had upwards revision.

>Nonfarm payrolls surged by 254,000 for the month, up from a revised 159,000 in August and better than the 150,000 Dow Jones consensus forecast. The unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, down 0.1 percentage point.; Thanks! ; Thanks when I searched the most recent Uber thread it was about Waymo taking over their moat. I was thinking it was that. But then I remembered reverse Reddit would be going against Google and that doesnt really happen on this sub. You cant speak ill of Mag 7 and not expect your post downvoted so it had to be something else.; What I mean is, NVDA still is a ""reddit portfolio"" stock. 90% here are bullish for it.; *How to Lose Trades and Confound People*; QQQ hitting 500 perhaps?; I don’t know what bears you saw talking about ttm pm. Major argument against current valuations from what I have read is sp500 fwd pe > 22 which according to them is inflated historically. Haven’t checked the historical median fwd pe myself.; Yeah I don’t like tobacco and won’t invest in it but I’m not sure who he thinks is getting scammed.; It's been a big issue in diplomatic and military circles this week- not in mainstream or finance circles yet though that's why I thought Dimon's quote was notable.

NK troops had been mainly in Kursk and behind the lines this week but now apparently they are confirmed crossing into Ukraine as of today. This is when we see NATO respond, likely with giving Ukraine more freedom to expand targets in Russia as has been discussed for months.

Personally I'm less keen on investing in traditional shipbuilding and more keen on autonomous marine tech. Similar to how they have the new fighters controlling a wing of drones, I think the US is moving toward aircraft carriers/destroyers controlling a pod of various drones to make up for the difference in manpower compared to China.; I have six sigma training and have been involved in setting limits for pass fail on test systems based on my knowledge and statistical trends.

If I was overseeing these economic data reports I'd be flagging everything as not within control limits and that the processes are wrong.

Edit: lmao. Dude goes through my comment history, lies about my humidifier advice (which is helpful by the way) then blocks me so I can't respond.

What a fucking CLOWN; Maybe, but that doesn't capture the daily results of the sector ETFs. Utilities, consumer staples, real estate and financial services were big underperformers.; Spy fwd PE is much higher than 22. Well, I guess it isn't if the FY25 earnings estimates are expecting unrealistically high EPS growth...; If only investing was as easy as looking at the fwd PE; Totally, yeah I'm less invested in pure naval ships, but companies that deal with components of it.  One of them is  $CW. It's also two fold, since they do both Naval and Nuclear, part of the reason why I think the company should have some nice tailwinds in the future.

This is some of the most DK performance art I’ve ever seen.  Right up there with telling someone to stick their head in a *dehumidifier* to heal from tonsil surgery.  

I tried to be nice.  I tried to help protect you from a patently false campaign-hoax that could be harming your financial knowledge.  No good deed...


Edit: I know fact checks are your team’s kryptonite, but the *true* weakest move is sending hate PMs from your 12 day old alt account, which has now been submitted to reddit admin for ban evasion.  

You telling someone to stick their head in a dehumidifier after surgery is about the worst possible advice, and it’s delivered with your standard overconfident wrongness.

And it’s *brava* not bravo, you subliterate goon.; Lol damn the go through history, respond, instant block is the weakest and saddest move in the Reddit playbook. 

Bravo /u/AntoniaFauci  Bravo; We’ll have to see as it comes. One thing I have learned about investing is inertia is a strong factor until the ride comes to a sudden halt it won’t stop.; If a chart that has held true for more than half a century shows that market tops in short term when a specific set of conditions are met (high fwd pe, p/fcf, ev/ebitda etc), I can see why few choose to remain cautious despite easing monetary conditions.

Things have changed quite a bit in last 2 years with optimism around AI that is driving a lot of investment and expanding valuation multiples in hopes we see an explosion in growth. When will it arrive? We don’t know. According to some, it may take a while and this is just the beginning of the investment that is needed. How long will the rich valuations last in anticipation? Could be a while since we are entering a low rates regime again and inflation continues to subside."
My whole portfolio is in this single stock...,"Does anyone put all or most of their entire portfolio into a single stock? I know it's not the mainstream thinking but I am trying to go back to 90s when nobody knew anything about investing and everybody who bought hot shot stocks like Apple and Amazon became rich. 

I'm considering putting my entire IRA into GEV. It can potentially ride off the AI boom and climate change politics while maintaining the stability of a well established energy company. Could GEV be the next Amazon? What stock are you all in?",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gbb64c/my_whole_portfolio_is_in_this_single_stock/,0,"this may be one of the ideas of all time; Horrible idea; No, moronic idea.

What about those people back then who put everything in Enron?; No. No
 No 
No no no.


Look, I ""get"" the AI, but putting all eggs into one basket is begging to lose everything.


I am NOT a fan of the clean energy sector for stocks. I thought I was, and I lost 50% value of what I put in. (Thankfully, I only had a few shares)


If you are only throwing in beer money, do whatever you want. If you are putting in tens of thousands, you want to be diverse and safe. 


And don't freaking go trusting the motley fool! Whatever they say looks to be doing ""super great, what a buy! OMG!"" Can and likely will drop. They have pushed stocks that have grown past their perceived value, and act like they will keep on growing and growing, only to lose massively in only a year.


Be safe with your future. ; Good way to lose all your money; I’d trust my money with the top 500 companies, rather then whatever the fuck GEV is.; MSTR is 60% of my portfolio; Yeah, I do, but because of circumstances, but i'm working in diversifying.

It was part of my compensation package that i received over the years working for a tech company that went through hyper growth. I was locked into them for a few years until the IPO (\~3 years ago). They're stock options with an exercise price that is a fraction of the market value today (over 40x gains).

I only started diversifying this year, but it's been slow since I can only sell during specific windows due to being an insider. I’ve managed to shift my net worth from 90% in the company to about 65%, with a goal to hit 50% by the end of the year. The state will be very happy with my income tax this year.

Diversifying was the best move I made. Even though the stock's been on a fast growth track, it dropped 10% last month, while my other new portfolio jumped 18%.; There is nothing wrong with this, just know that this is higher Risk and higher reward than your usual etf. 

this Is what a lot of billionaires do and some retail people can pull it off too.  You just have to consistent and have a few really good picks. 

no idea on how gev will perform but I used to do this with Apple Netflix Tesla amazon Msft and Nvidia before they were big, but you would see the stupidest Reddit comments saying netflix was dead in 2010 and Apple was for sheeples. 

if you are right, you win big, if wrong lose big. Depends if you got the Midas touch to pick the winners.; Just ensure you know this is gambling. If you’re good with it, the casinos will be open tomorrow morning until 4pm; Great idea



Search for 10-20 stocks who fit your criteria



Only 1 stock is way to risky; Have a look at the concept of survivor bias…you hear about the very small percentage of people who picked a winner at its very early stages, because it worked for them.

What you don’t hear about is the actual hoards of investors who had the same plan and got buried.

This is a terrible plan, and a basic understanding of risk management will make this obvious. 

You’d be much much much better off if you even just focused on one sector as your strategy.

 Not even the very best investors use this strategy you’re planning, and that’s what makes them the best investors.; Do it; !remindme in two years if this guy is on r/wallstreetbets or not, lol; Then why not bet on a company that has more chances to not go south? Like Microsoft, Apple.

For how long do you want to invest?; I wouldn’t go 100% right away but I’d ease into it. People should only buy the best of the best and currently and it’s a true market leader. If you’re going to go 100% in, make sure you get out fast if it goes against you more than 7-10%. Manage risk and don’t let it devastate you

Edit: the # of people commenting not knowing GEV or understanding it is good to see. By the time they realize, it’ll probably be too late for them; I think it depends on how much capital we’re talking about. If you’re young, and it’s like mid to low 5 figures I’d do it. Provided you think you’ve spotted something the market hasn’t; Confucius once said “Don’t put all your eggs in one basket”; Lol, Going back to the 1890s ??!; If you bought some fruit company in the 80s it would have paid off bigly.; I was happy to see GEV mentioned in a post and then have to find out it’s a moron; I do it, just mostly to swing. I'm young & I have the option of being risky.. but it's definitely not smart.; For peace of mind I wouldn’t put all your eggs in one basket. If the stock goes down, then you are going to regret it. If the stock goes up, then you are going to be lucky. It is impossible to predict, whether the stock will go up or down. It is far better to invest in different stocks, so that if one stock goes down at least the other stock might go up and keep your portfolio balanced!; You can never research corporate shenanigans that will happen in the future. Always a potential with every company and that's why you don't put all your eggs in one basket. Some things are out of your control; It can go really great, or more likely go really wrong. Half of the companies in the Fortune500 25 years ago dont exists today. Even fewer outperformed the market in that time. Go for an etf. Youll thank yourself later; In my books, it's a (really) bad idea to put all your savings into one company. Why not use AI ETFs if that's the theme you are attracted to. Some ETFs worth exploring: DTCR XT SPYG BOTZ FTEC; High Risk / High Reward

As long as you know this going in….; Boom or bust; Nobody knew anything about investing in the 90's.  

Proceeds to yolo into a single, low quality stock; Don’t do it! Put 20% max… even that will get you scolded by the boggleheads; that's a gross mischaracterization of that time.  Sit around young ones, let me tell you about the old times.

There was Dell, there was Cisco... those were the hot ones in the late 90s.  Apple was forgotten about.  IBM was a great company to work for.

The hot companies now weren't the hot companies then, Yahoo was bigger than Google.

This is why people say time in the market is better than trading.  If you bought 5 different companies, 2 hot, one safe, and 2 up and coming... odds are you would have done pretty well.  AMD had a moment in the late 90s / early 2000s... before it crashed back the 2s for 10 years until it started to climb to where it is now.

Funds are more prevalent these days, I'd go with those.

So no... don't go with one company, spread it around.  Most people won't be right about that one company in the long run.; No. You are gambling. Sure it’s possible you win, but it’s also possible you lose a ton or even all of your hard earnings savings trying a get rich quick scheme. And on such a new business still since only 2021. They’ve done well but it is performance chasing If you have a long time horizon and want to be extremely aggressive I would AT THE VERY LEAST choose 5-10 stocks. Or pick an extremely aggressive ETF with a smaller amount of stocks to at least get a tiny bit of diversity in case one or two die off you aren’t totally gone; Most of the companies out there don't turn into Apple's and Amazon's of today. Even majority of the companies in S&P 500 will disappear in a decade or two. So it would be a bad idea to put all your money into one stock.; The fact that people are now posting about ""I'm going to put everything into AI"" (another thread recently) or ""I'm putting everything into a company that already gone straight up for several months after spinning off"" - starting to feel kinda 2021-ish again.

You buy a decent chunk (5-10-15%?) when something like GEV spins off or some reasonable amount of time later. Or you buy a handful of AI power/grid related/industrial AI beneficary (VRT, PWR, EME, VST/CEG, etc etc etc) names early/early-ish on. Putting 100% of your portfolio into GEV after it's had a 125% run in 7 months (and currently has an 82 RSI - way into overbought territory) is going to result in you dumping probably more than half of it when it has a correction and you're entirely reliant on it.

It's not that it isn't a good company. It's the idea that 1) there's so many great companies and there are themes beyond AI, 2) you're entirely reliant upon it - it has had a great run already, may do fine over the long-term but there's going to be times when it won't do well. It's already up 125% in seven months. What if it has a 10-20% correction while the index does fine? While it's a great company, companies are not infallible - there's always the risk that something can go South in any company.  Or something happens to the theme - for all the hype over ai and power demand, if anything disappoints in that regard names like GEV have priced in a lot of growth.

I don't know, I think there's dozens of fantastic companies in the world but there's nothing that I'd put 100% into. And I'm not ""you have to be well-diversified"" - I do think that one should be *reasonably* diversified though in terms of names/themes/sectors/etc. Start to be even overly reliant on something and underperform over 3 months turns to 6 months and it will start to be increasingly dismaying to see the indexes continue to outperform. People see something like the AI power names go up like they have this year and it's ""can't get enough of a good thing"" and then eventually there's a correction ""can't get enough of a good thing"" quickly turns into ""too much of a good thing"" and people dump.; Consolidation makes money but to put it in a highly speculative stock is pure gambling. I personally have 50% of my investments in single stock, but I rotate it (as best as I can) pretty regularly, 3-4 times a year, rest ot my money is in bunch of broad etfs. I was burned early in my investing with hot companies of those times like HP etc. Single stocks have a chance to go parabolic up or down many examples around.; This will make you either a stock picking genius or a wallstreetbest brainlet (all in hindsight).; I have...but basically because I'm not interested in stocks generally. I just bought the product. Saw that it was far better than people said, had a bit of cash lying around...and sunk a bit of money into stock for the company and left it there (bought a bit more last year).

So far so good. But I'd be the first to admit that I got *extremely* lucky with the timings (both times); You are basically gambling doing this. It isn’t a sound long term investment strategy. Most get rich quick schemes don’t usually work out. You point out some of the winners. There are also some big losers like Nortel.; I don´t think an utility company will be the next amazon wtf... You gotta have a product and a competitive advantage..; Extremely bad idea.   It's incredibly hard to pick winners.   It's much better to have the bulk of your money in broad based index things, and do individual stocks on the edges of that.   Diversification is a good thing.   Think of investing in single stocks as a way of just doubling up on what you think might be good in the broader index.    Better still if you can recognize that doing this is essentially gambling.   A little gambling is fine, but not with your entire portfolio.   

Just my 2 cents.; GE. General Electric??; I worked for GE, before the breakup but still...

My only answer is no -- don't do it -- I no longer own a single share of any GE, almost as bad as owning BA from a corporate culture perspective.

If you ARE going to do one stock, then do a market ETF like ONEQ, VOO, DIA so you are at least diversified in a market.

Double in 5 years isn't that impressive, good but not impressive. COST in that same period has tripled.; It's an ok idea. I put a large portion of mine into SERV Robotics, to answer your question. It's got backing of Uber, Nvidia, etc., just recently evolved their robots to gen 3, better and cheaper to make, etc. I think it's a great stock with big potential, but that's me personally, like you with GEV; Normally for an individual investor you would have 3-5 good stocks. 

But u must really know how to pick stocks though.; If you know what you’re doing, I am a fan of the “Put all of your eggs in one basket and watch watch that basket very closely” mindset. 

If it works, stick with it; 😂🤣; There's nothing ""inherently"" wrong with this if you control for risk or are willing to lose everything. But you're having some crazy survivorship bias. Also, everyone knew about investing in the 90s, what the hell are you talking about?; I agree. ; SO SO idea.; I mean, it works, until it doesn’t. It’s very efficient to carry all your eggs in one basket sometimes, sometimes it may even work, but better hope you don’t stumble!; Or Theranos; JDS Uniphase . . . ugggg; well you could also buy a Gigant stock like Microsoft with HUGE competitive advantages and hold it...; Or to make a lot of money; It's GE's energy spinoff. Not exactly a fly by night operation.; It's had 125% growth over the last year.; Noice; This is a really important point that I wish some of the naysayers on this forum would consider. Many people have no choice but to be heavily invested in one stock because that's how there employer pays them.; I will be messaging you in 2 years on [**2026-10-24 20:11:17 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2026-10-24%2020:11:17%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gbb64c/my_whole_portfolio_is_in_this_single_stock/ltkjjlh/?context=3)

|-|-|-|-|; Remind me also in 2 years so I can send this guy a stick out tongue emoji when I'm not on r/wallstreetbets and am instead sitting in my flying electric car paid for using early withdrawals from my GEV IRA.; Confucius died poor; What product/company is this?; That's what people said about Amazon; Nice suggestion. I'll have to look into that; I mean, how many eggs are we talking?; MSFT; Pets.com; Better off just playing roulette if you like gambling all your money.; He actually didn't; He did have a killer ‘stash and a gnarly beard to stroke though, probably knew some stuff. 

Also Confucius would be totally in favour of sound financial planning, which this is not.; Bought a Tesla Model 3 in 2019 (sight unseen, as I ordered a year before they even shipped to my country). Drove around a few days and also gave some rides to friends and relatives - EVs were still pretty much a novelty at that point. All of them were blown away how superior it was to an ICE car. So I knew people were interested in buying EVs.

That - and the general anti-EV FUD machine that was going on at the time - gave me the notion that the stock price was seriously undervalued. (Granted, people were still speculating back then whether Tesla would go bankrupt. It was deinitely a risky move).

So I sunk a bit of money into it. Last year - when all the FUD was going on again after Musk bought Twitter and the stock tanked a bit - I bought more.

Needless to say that has worked out astonishingly well so far.

Would I advise this strategy? Hell no! I was fully prepared (and expecting!) to lose my initial investment. Only ever play with money that you basically already consider 'lost'.; True. Odds of making money on roulette is same as  making money from a single stock like AAPL.; Confusionus didn’t have a TV or the internets, ergo Confunions was a poor. QED /s; yeah, he is still alive and well; The odds of making money on roulette are actually better than trying and successfully identifying the next Apple.; Who’s talking about the next Apple. I’m talking about the one we have; What about them? You’re a bit late to the party if you’re expecting apple to make returns like they have over the since the 90s like OP wants lol; I think we can still make about 15-20% every year with aapl; They’re already the biggest constituent of the S&P 500, their market cap is 3.5 trillion. If they returned 20% every year for the next ten years they’ll have a nearly 22 trillion dollar market cap. Not gonna happen buddy. They’re the biggest company in the world, they’re at the point of diminishing returns now."
Three stocks that you feel will outperform the market over the next 5 years,"Like the title says: which three stocks, individual equities, do you believe will outperform the market, Market Index Funds: VOO, ONEQ, or DIA?

My takes:

COST -- Costco has a great expansion model, a great business model, and loyalty like few other companies: customer, employee, and vendors.

AAPL -- I continue to see them innovate, they won't stick with something that isn't working, and their stuff just works.

Third slot is a bit tougher: GOOG, NVDA, or JPM in that order.

",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gb1i5u/three_stocks_that_you_feel_will_outperform_the/,0,">AAPL -- I continue to see them innovate

We dont live in the same planet; No wonder people are complaining the market has no opportunities. There’s a whole universe of stocks but you had to pick something with almost no growth trading at stroke multiples.; [This exact question was asked only three days on ago in this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/s/qhKNIkcC4x); Costco will lose their goodwill is my potentially terrible take; So 5 stocks?; Siemens Energy; Tesla will if Trump wins.  If he doesn’t win then it will drop like 80-90%; I think that AAPL and NVDA are both popular and obvious answers given trending themes. Outside of that: Meta, AMZN, JPM; what exactly does apple innovate?  
Stuff that samsung already had 5 years ago?; VRT, UEC, AVGO, PLTR, IONQ; VT,SLPG&SCHD! And thank me later; Im pretty excited about the plan to put apartment on top of cotsco in certain cities nut have no idea how will impact the bottom line; Sherman Williams; costco already priced for perfection; Not Pfizer; Quantumscape ($QS) - EV solid state cell manufacturer

There are major catalysts in the next 5 years. They just shipped first generation B sample cells to their automotive partners this week. For context, C samples can be sold and used in vehicles. So 'commercialization' should be coming sometime in 2026.

Their cells should make it into test vehicles sometime next year, and they also have a licensing agreement with VW for them to build a factory and produce for between 500k and 1 million vehicles, annually. We should hear movement on that (in terms of breaking ground) some time in 2026 / 2027.

They currently have two parallel paths to commercialization. One being the aforementioned licensing deal (which is longer term). The other is their current production operations in California. Late 2025 is their target for high volume / 2nd generation B samples. After which, they should be able to sell their cells from that line. It will be for a limited release, premium vehicle (likely a Lamborghini / Porsche) - enough production to provide roughly 50-100 cars per year (assuming only one production line is built). Annual revenue rate will probably top out in the single digit million dollar range to start out. But, that would represent a major derisking event. 

Assuming they succeed, this stock could easily 10x in the next 5 years.; Buy the ETF but leveraged lol; I think these questions need to be banned or at least have a once a month limit or mega thread. It’s getting boring; Basically you're asking people for their portfolio, coz obviously they picked those over the index, under a presumption that they'll outperform. 


If you're just looking to outperform, get 2X, 3X leveraged index. Don't want downside? Buy an additional far-out PUT as an insurance policy. This will be cheaper than spending time in _""research""_ and taking on any extra risk / bets with individual companies.


I'm sure this strategy has a flaw. Anyone spot it?; Mstr, uec, uroy; New colors = innovation; They always have something brewing when you least expect them to. AirPods prime example, they are so creative and great with product design; was about to comment something like that too when I saw that line. Apple's innovation died with Steve Jobs. The products are fine but the company is really a shadow of what it used to be; Apple silicon is unparalleled for laptop performance; Slightly different but close.

I was asking not about 2025 but about 2025-2030.

But, thanks for the point out.; How do you reckon?; My third slot is filled with 15 stocks so, 17.; Reading is hard huh?; So you are expecting that the Government will buy a bunch of TSLAs -- maybe mail trucks (currently purchased from Mercedes)?

Interesting thought, I hope that isn't true but interesting thought.; Interesting, I used to own Pfizer but sold it a bit ago. I think I sold it because of underperformance and some news or other.

Why do you say that?; Interesting,

Their website is faster, more performant, cheaper, less filling... Kind of off putting as it is marketing speak and buzz word heavy.

But, I have read about some of the battery tech out there so will see if someone has done a compare between lithium ion and EV solid state cells. Cost, ramp up, advantages, etc.

They seem to fluctuate between 5 and 9 with sudden spikes that shoot it nearly double followed by a slow drop back to baseline. Will put a watch on it, see if it gets under 6.

Thanks for the heads up; LOL, well maybe their portfolios are doing much better than most of my picks. I have some real losers: INTC, INO, SPCE, MDRX...; Retina display!; Bad example. Most knockoffs are 90% as good and 10% the cost. Apple is a lifestyle fashion company that happens to sell phones and computers; unparalleled is a very strong word. 
Apple chips are very specific for certain things like energy efficiency. And they are not that far ahead of the competition, specialy if we consider the price

But at the same time they are WAY behind many chips for video editing and gaming. Not to mention that just this chips wont mean that Apple is doing alot of innovation. Apple is not intel, and they years behind many of its competition in many sectors; delusion much, huh?; I for one, despise shopping at Costco.  From the receipt checks, checking your picture on the self checkout line, dumb ass decisions to fill the freezer aisle with skids of stuff so that if someone is getting something with the door open, no one is able to pass because they can’t seem to bother themselves to have both big carts and normal size carts, to changing the location of items on a constant basis, sheer hordes of people, not having a variety of an item.   I despise shopping there and now limit going as much as possible; The hot dog.

They’ve painted themselves into a corner and at some point the cost to produce and sell the dog will be in the dozens of dollars due to inflation, but if they raise the price there will be blood in the streets.  It may be a great loss leader for now, but eventually it will cause their downfall.; How did you do the hair thingy I literally brushed my phone twice coz I thought an eyelash dropped lol; It’s a hot take for sure.  But if Musk gets a powerful cabinet position in the White House, which Trump has promised him, then there’s no telling what old Musky boy will do with that power.; Because of the terrible performance after Covid. The company is hated AF. Great news are meh news. Good news are bad news. Bad news are terrible news. Terrible news are catastrophic news. And that won’t change overnight.

Disclaimer: I own it… my average is $35,71 😬 yay? Still not selling, I’m a patient ‘un.; You forgot the Chinese stocks like PDD! Beating index, you can do in two ways: picking the top winners and steering clear of losers (easier than the former). They could seem like a bargains, but are really value traps.; Gaming/3D, absolutely. Video editing, not a chance. I’ve been a PC guy my whole life. I have a balls-to-the-wall i9 4090 gaming desktop. It scrubs through the same footage slower than my M2 Max laptop, while drawing like 10x the power. For creatives that need to travel, MacBooks are just better.; This is some deep DD; Hotdogs will never cost dozens of dollars; Homie check out the concept of ""loss leaders""; Let's see. They have a loss leader that is institutional. They have done everything to keep costs as low as possible. Soda is cheap, and they get a great deal from their vendor. The bun is manufactured in house, the hot dog is also manufactured by Kirkland. The Kraut/condiments -- okay.

And most people go for the pizza anyways, which they have a program started where you order your pizza at the door and it is ready for you when you leave -- and that is not a loss leader.

I think they will do fine. They are also now international and manufacturing internationally, shipping between the countries. So, I can get sake in my NC store because it is available in the Japan Costco and they import it into the states. The stores are all the same, their growth is measured and exact, their products may be regional but they are cross docking so it isn't a heavy cost.

In the Kanazawa Costco I can get a lot more fish and seafood, A-4 Kobe beef, beef tongue -- all in smaller packages to accommodate the Japanese Market.

Spain I can get more seafood and lamb, and Jason iberico -- which is also transported to the US in the fall and spring.; Just checked, I must have sold it before 10-24 because it doesn't come up in any of my account histories. If I recall correctly, I sold it to finance my MRNA purchase in the spring of 20 -- I should keep a transaction diary; People used to say they’d never cost $5; /s; Don't really like Costco at this price. Meh shopping experience and food quality. USA waking up to artisan produce and may shop locally a bit more, especially with smaller families. Europeans don't really go for it, novelty in China probably; I miss the sarcasm font; I am expecting a split -- the price is too high for most investors to accumulate.

Or, did you mean that the price is too high against fundamentals?; P/E is too high"
Boeing machinists reject new labor contract extending more than 5-week strike,"Boeing machinists rejected a new labor deal that included 35% wage increases over four years, their union said Wednesday, extending a more than five-week strike that has halted most of the company’s aircraft production, which is centered in the Seattle area.

So long dental plan; If the machinists pay was tied to c suite pay. I’d happily sign even for a 0.1% salary increase. Because I know sooner than later they would want their double digit pay increase and stock comp and bonuses but if u have to pay the same percentage to each employee…. Suddenly everyone gets paid a more fairer wage; It seems the machinists are prioritizing more than just wage increases—likely seeking better job security, benefits, or work conditions. A 35% wage increase over four years is significant, but it may not address deeper concerns about long-term stability or the current working environment. The strike's continuation suggests they feel something important is still missing.; Government (taxpayer) bailout incoming; There needs to be a law capping all executive salaries and bonuses, and the ways they can earn them.

Seems like if they issued enough stock to employees, say a pensions' worth, they can end the strike without their expenses going up and then they'd also have massive employee buy-in because their personal weath would then scale with the success of the company.; Rather be out of work and get laid off than get back to work.; Boeing is bleeding money, strike for much longer and there might not be any work to go to.; The government should just take over and then everyone gets assigned salary band and we are done.; This isn’t looking great for shareholders so Boeing sucks at that too; >Boeing execs care about one thing…shareholders.

They don't even care about shareholders. They only care about themselves. 

Boeing's executives wasted billions of dollars on stock buybacks when the stock was at all time highs in order to temporarily juice stock prices (and their own pay). Meanwhile the business was rotting from the inside, and their dysfunctional management has caused the company to lose money every year since 2018. Now they are issuing tens of billions worth of new stock and diluting shareholders to stave off bankruptcy.

Buying stock high and selling low is a practice that ultimately harms shareholders, but American shareholders are docile starry eyed sheep who blindly follow whatever management tells them.; Should be the way.  Shareholders are risking their capital.  Workers risk nothing, they can always find another job.  That is why capital gains tax must be lower than income tax.  No investors, no jobs, it's that simple.; Their pension restored apparently; The union itself is very weak. However the workforce has come together to get the past decade worth of pay and benefit increases they have been denied. This past contract was ten years. Through Covid, inflation and  the changing world our pay has remained the same. You can flip burgers here locally in Washington for the same wage as an entry level manufacturing mechanic at Boeing.; raises that will beat the inflation. for the past 8 years, raises were 4%. this is about restoring the past, all the lost money. 35% compounded for the next 4 years don't do that.; 1.3%; Boeing spends billions of stock buyback using debt, then starts crying about going belly up because they are drowning in debt. What a clown show...; They already get that in their defense contacts; But but the executives are the reason the business is making money. Without them, Boeing wouldn't survive. Executives do all the really hard work like going to conferences and board meetings. /S; you take it then; The federal govt has both a 401k (called TSP with 5% matching) and pension program (FERS)...; They have both, stop spewing BS; as the other stated, the Gov uses both a 401k and pension. also, getting a pension from the government is VASTLY different than an individual company. not to mention, the government structured the pension plan to be much better than the average pension plans that would be offered.; Most people if they are lucky get a cost of living raise of 3%.; lol. Tell me you are in a union without telling me you are. 

I watched my friend at a meat packing plant strike time after time until one day the company closed the plant and moved it to Mexico. 

Greedy union bears all the blame IMO; They may be able to lay off some people but if they don’t want to kill the company they need that highly trained and certified workforce. The power is with the union here.; The employees are highly wanted by other companies. They can find work; Bruh that’s called communism; BA is mostly institutional investors.  not retail.; >Workers risk nothing, they can always find another job.

That's a wild take.; Are you trolling? There's no business for people to invest in without workers. Workers create value, shareholders create nothing.; Once the initial investment has been made back, either in stock value or cash transaction the assumption of risk is null and void. Which with a multinational corporation or Boeing's status, happened a long time ago. Also, we the taxpayers have been awarding Boeing lucrative government contracts, so the people working for Boeing who haven't received a raise in 10 years are paying tax dollars that go to lining shareholder pockets. No part of this is how it's supposed to work

As much as you think your claim that without shareholders there would be no jobs, without labor there would be no product, or profit, for anyone; [removed]; Bahahahaha; Sounds like pretty reasonable demand to me...; Wasn't it that they wanted a defined benefit pension restored, specifically?

Which is going against the grain a lot considering most companies have switched to defined contribution for their pensions; 
The problem is that the pension is paid out, no matter what.    And ALL the burden of funding it lies upon the company/employer, with no contribution by employees like a 401k.  It starts off as a 1 to 1 expense and (hopefully) as investments mature, becomes funded by said investments. But, if there are dips and downturns in the stock market, the burden of paying the pension is still on the company.  Inflation, cost of living raises, etc.  All hurt the actuarial factoring. 

Short answer:  they often remain underfunded causing the company to take on ever increasing payouts. 

They are a financial nightmare when rolled-out on a large scale, long term basis.  

https://siepr.stanford.edu/news/public-pensions-are-mixing-risky-investments-unrealistic-predictions; So they want a pension and 401K?; So long dental plan; I would lol; Yeah, tsp is better.; And most people aren't in an union. What's your point?; [removed]; Lol silly workers wanting a fair wage and benefits while their corpo execs get paid millions and the company does stock buy-backs; God you love licking that corpo boot. “LMAO YOU WANT MORE MONEY?? What a peasant way to live! HA HA HA” like, that’s how you sound right now.; You mis-spelled company; Boeing can't just close up shop and move to Mexico ; Even if that's true I doubt there are enough jobs when the biggest aerospace manufacturer goes belly up. That being said they will get bailed out by the government long before actually going belly up; Communism would be no salary bands. Also no Boeing. Also no salary. You just get assigned a tiny apartment next to a coal mine, and a small ration each week. If you’re lucky. More if you’re close to party leaders. Also don’t protest, walk out, or stop working, or you get sent to the gulag.

More people should read The Gulag Archipelago by Alexander Solzhenitsyn.; Thats not true. If you can get 5% in government bonds for 10 years as you recently could or you invest your money in risky buisness. If you only made your money back youd be much worse off having taken all that risk than with the risk free 5% (which when reinvested would give you more than 150% of your original cash).

You want risky assets to return MORE than safe assets otherwise the risk was not worth it. 

Also you definitely want to beat inflation.
Consider that many comoanies go bankrupt so even if one of them does very well it has to compensate the losses on other investments.

Risk has to be rewarded.

A full explanation of all /r/stocks rules can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/rules; Honest question. why not?; The assumption of growth is the risk yes, but the assumption that labor doesn't need to be paid fairly for THEIR investment, time away from family in exchange for a wage is poor business and that being commonplace is a good sign of a failing society. The business of capitalism is good for all until those with power decided the only valuable investment is the one they are bothered to make; There is no company without workers. How many planes are rolling off the Washington plant right now? Zero. Pay people right and this wouldn’t happen.; I feel the same. I have so many older family members who were screwed out of pensions right before they would have been eligible, too. I would never put that much faith in a company. With a 401k I’m in control.; [deleted]; The union members, AKA the people paying the dues, are the ones who rejected the contract. The part of the union that collects union dues don't decide whether a contract is accepted, just whether they will bring it to the members to vote; Actually pensions are more difficult on the employer than 401ks which is why they tell you they are better with a match or something.; I think they want both.; No, they aren't. 

Pensions are far more efficient than 401ks, delivering the same payout in retirement with only 50% of the input cost. There are three big reasons for this: 

1) Actuarial savings. With a 401k, you must save enough money and limit withdrawal rates to a level low enough to last for your maximum potential lifespan. Defined benefit pensions only need to save enough for the average worker's lifespan, because some people will die earlier and others will die later. This reduces the cost of a given future income by 30%. 

2) Reduced management fees, which save approximately 10%. 

3) With a 401k, your asset allocation must vary across your lifespan. When you're young you can maintain 100% equities, giving a high rate of return. However, you have virtually no money invested. Conversely, as you get older, you must add bonds to account for sequence of return risk, reducing your average rate of return during the time when you have the largest account balance. Pension funds can maintain an optimal asset allocation at all times, increasing the lifetime rate of return.; It's the workers who vote, not the 'union', so the union only wants what the workers want, not the other way around; Of which Boeing has probably the best match in industry, maybe the country.  I left two years ago because the job was fucking awful, but I had a flat 11% match I believe, think more senior people got 12%.  When I first started I think it was 100% match of 6% then 50% match of the next 6 or 8% with a lot more as you gain years of senority.  So they've even increased it relatively recently.  That all vests immediately too.

I'm at another DoD contractor now that's 6% match that vests after 2 years and that's pretty standard.

Non-union engineer though so I don't know what it'd be for union machinists.; I have friends who work at Ba. It’s a feast and famine org by nature. When times were lean they took loans out against the 401ks.  When times were good they got to pay themselves back interest on the 401k loan taking money away from themselves. They are doing this while they are trying to get caught up. 

Then times get lean again and the process repeats. 

For a 401k system with a feast or famine organization you really have to pay top tier wages. Boeing used to. That juxtaposition is the problem.; and then you get my company which told me in 2025 our pensions will be converted to cash into an existing 401k or similar.  a real joy because it be very interesting to see how many years of pension they attribute everyone.; I don’t know if you’ve ever been in a union but a lot of these guys don’t really understand saving and live hand-to-mouth. Everyone in my former union made six figures plus, drove $65k trucks, and could maybe miss one paycheck before struggling to feed their family without credit cards.

Pensions save them from themselves and have become pretty dogmatic in unions despite their high operating cost and low ROI.; Almost as if better labour laws would be better than unions; But Reddit told me that pensions are the best thing ever and that 401ks are terrible! Reddit said so!; You guys call defined contribution a 401k, right? With an employer match?

Most companies don't have that?; This. At some point the wealthy go to far. They eat too much of the cake. So much in fact that 35% over 4 years is a bad deal if you look at inflation and payraise on one side and profit increase on the other over the last 20 years. Should be somewhere around 300% to actually make it fair.


So yeah. Fuck the wealthy. I stand with the machinists.; Therein lies the problem.  
It's the stratospheric compensation of the upper levels of management. 

It creates a state similar to The Royals versus the poor farmers of Ireland during the potato famine.   

Creating a wealth class that is overly celebratory of its wealth naturally creates animosity.  It's a bad situation. 

 But fighting back with a money losing proposition is an equally bad situation. 

Unlike the Royals/King of England, Boeing is a publicly traded company that is duty sworn to be responsible and act in a fiduciary manner for It's shareholders.; Yeah, I think I  got confused but I’ll eat my mistake instead of deleting it 

My wife has a (state gov) pension but is not permitted a 401k through her work.   There’s also something about social security and I am not sure if she’s eligible.; So you just show why unions are a good thing for workers. That's your point yeah?; Im not saying you shouldnt. But the logic of once youve made your money back (maybe in a decade?) any further profit is greed is plainly wrong; Do you have that much faith in a private sector company? The first thing before they go bankrupt is defaulting on pension obligations. This happened ALOT in the past.

The only pension system I believe in is from the federal government, and even that is getting relatively more sketchy nowadays.; The union also has a strike fund. Currently paying 250$ a week to each union worker.; They make voting recommendations, however, and they recommended a no vote; What?!? Management would *lie*? *Surely*, they would never do *that*!; In an ideal world you would. And to have an ideal world as a worker you need to strike for it.; im actually curious on where you are getting those numbers.

but in general, it depends on the 401k and the pension plan. you cant say 1 is better than the other.

But assuming the general 401k plan and a general pension plan:

1. you're understanding of how a retirement account (401k/IRA/etc) works or its aim sounds very limited. Also, a pension plan generally only allows spousal benefits. any additional $$$ in it will be forefieted or else. a 401k can be inherited. Also curious on where that 30% is coming from

2. really curious on where you getting this value.

3. have you done a general retirement account (401k/ira/taxed account etc) forecast? it doesnt sound like you have.

the only objectivly speaking time a pension is better than a 401k are when:

1. the company is for sure wont go bankrupt

2. they are responsible in their investment choices (your hands are in the employer. as they choose the investments and the risk)

3. you are horrible with finances or in general not financally savvy and better off someone else taking the reigns to ensure you are saving up for retirement.

4: edit: forgot to include. also if you are planning on staying at 1 company forever.

a pension is great. a 401k is great. its better to have them than not. if i had to choose between the general 401k plan and a general pension plan, i would go with a 401k.; Unions are a gang or cult like any other collective body with it's hand in your pocket.; I have a feeling those Redditors haven't been in the workforce for long or aren't even American.

Pensions have the same issues as employer-sponsored healthcare. They anchor you to a company. 

My employer matches both my 401k and my HSA contributions. That money is 100% mine and I can take it anywhere, any time. A pension isn't guaranteed nor do I have any control over it until I retire.; Lol imagine saying this under a comment on Reddit telling you pensions are bad and 401ks are good. Where's your self-awareness?; Average 401k match in the US is 3-4%. That’s poopoo. 
And you typically have to contribute double since many companies do 50% match on your contribution.; In the US, a 401k and a pension are two different things. There's no such thing as a ""defined contribution pension"" because there's no such thing as a ""401k pension.""

Most professional companies have 401ks. Pretty much only government workers have a pension, and even then, not all of them.; Every state has different plans depending on when you started working for the state. Federally they offer both options, though. 

In some state-ran organizations, (fire departments, police, etc.), they do not pay into social security and instead receive a pension from the organization. Your wife may have access to something called a 457 or a TSP, though. 

Suffice it to say, government retirement plans are confusing and not necessarily similar to each other; My point is that turning down an 8% raise especially in this economic climate where most people only receive 2-3% as cost of living adjustments, if anything at all seems excessive. It creates the perception that the union is being unreasonable or greedy, rather than advocating for fair compensation. Many people would be thrilled with an 8% increase, and rejecting it makes it harder for others to support unions when they are seen as asking for more than what is generally considered fair, especially when unionized workers have more protections and benefits than the average worker.; That’s atrocious. It says something that the members would still vote to continue.; Recommending a vote surely isn't the same as actually voting though, is it?; No they didn't. Don't lie.; I didn't believe it a first either, but now I'm starting to think that it might be possible.

I also read an article the other day that implied that not everything on the internet is accurate. If that turns out to be true my life will be turned upside down.; they'll get neither when the company goes under; Apart from the fact that unionised workforces are better off compared to non unionised the world over you are 100% correct. 

It's the only way workers can level the power imbalance with employers to negotiate; I'll take the gang that puts money in my pocket and an insurance card in my wallet, thank-you-very-much.; This is such bullshit; You can definitely quit and request a commuted value of your pension, what are you saying?; I was a teenager in the 2010’s (I’m 27 now) and when I was on Reddit back then I would see a lot of “pension” this and “pension” that. “We need pensions!” You might be right about the young people part cause they were most likely young millennials. 

There’s PLENTY of examples of people working decades & having a pension but then the pension disappears. Now they have no retirement. Least with a 401k you have some control and can move it. 

Never understood the appeal of pensions.; Isn’t Boeing 100% up to 12%? That’s pretty fantastic; I never knew how good the military's 401k match was, at 1% for free and the next 4% at 100% or 50% match until you get a average of 5% at 100% match total.; Oh. That is quite poopoo.; A 401k with a 3-4% match is still better than any other retirement vehicle.; 
>My point is that turning down an 8% raise especially in this economic climate

Yeah especially in this climate after record inflation the past few years where salary stagnated and real buying power was reduced for a bunch of reasons this isn't greedy.; Orrr maybe non-unionized workers and the public will be inspired by this show of power by the union and realize that they too could be demanding much more generous compensation if they organized, even if they'd personally accept an 8% raise. You're approaching the issue from a negative perspective and landing on a negative conclusion.; While I understand where you are coming from, this is exactly the long term mindset that corporate America hopes for in the general populace.

You are essentially arguing that because other people get almost nothing that they should be happy with getting scraps.; Why would they vote to continue ?; No but it’s also not how it works. If the members start voting against the union position then why have a union? That’s basically the end.; It won't; People keep saying this. Boeing is not going under guy. It’s loony toons to think that they are.; Nor does management and shareholders. Workers are exposing the very clear mutually beneficial relationship. The threats to go under are not credible; Boeing is 10% and you’re vested on day one I believe; It's dollar for dollar 10% plus a company contribution of around 4%; It’s not that good. Sure, good compared to civilian sector. But both aren’t good so 🤷🏼‍♂️; Why do you think?; You really need to ask?; Union position is no vote according to poster above you. Members also voted no. So the members and the union are aligned in this case. That being said you can have members vote different than union recommendation. Sometimes union will bring to members a tentative agreement in which they are not sure how the members will vote. Union might recommend yes or no, but the members at large will think differently.; So if the Swiss people vote against what the state council recommends, Switzerland is basically no more?; Honestly I’d take that in a heartbeat; True. Especially if you're lower enlisted and 5% of your base pay doesn't mean very much; How could that possibly be relevant"
Best place to put $750k from selling an investment property. I am 52,I am ready to sell my investment property which I purchased back in 2006.  I put down $300k at the time and has almost doubled.

If your approach to investing is the way you described above then it sounds like you have very little experience with investing. You should probably consider sitting down with a professional.; I can’t tell if you’re looking for short term ideas or long term. You can always invest in a high dividend ETF. If you’re long term you can do VOO or VTI. If you’re long term and want to play it safe you can do a Target Date Fund.; Up your nose!

Been paying 8%+ with monthly distributions. Hasn’t missed a payment since inception in 2014; Good luck. I heard you can win billions.; I like all of these but I need some cash flow until my business gets back to normal.; It's definitely not going to lose me money.; I can't respond to the post because my reddit/browser combo doesn't work well but to answer his question, I'd keep the house and rent it out.  Real estate is a real asset and safer in this environment of uncertainty than stocks, especially considering his time horizon.

Thinking that your money will multiply by 100x by buying the last company to appreciate by 100x is lunacy.  Apple, a $3 trillion company, is not likely to become a $300 trillion company any time in your lifetime.  That would make it worth more than the rest of the world combined.  It's not *that* great.; And what if you had put it in Enron or GE or BlackBerry? That’s a terrible way of thinking.; Then maybe a high dividend etf would be best.; I appreciate your comment. The house does give off $2600 positive cash monthly minus tax/ins but my mortgage business has been so slow I am using credit cards so I need a way of staying above water until a real President enters and lowers rates. I agree I love property way more than stocks but at this time I need some cash flow.; I'm pretty sure it will triple in the next 5-10 years.

You'll ai have faith in you.; Nice 20% YTD return but only 4% div? I guess I may need to sell shares to pay bills some months.; Well, a few things for you. 

The president doesn’t control rates, the federal reserve does that. The reason rates are high right now is because we had inflation which can be a serious long term problem if not addressed. A change of administration is not going to change the underlying pressure we have from inflation.

If you don’t like the current situation for the mortgage business you’ll really hate a world with runaway inflation.

Now, to your cash need situation.

You’re going to have to choose between short term cash needs and long term access to this money. If you want 4-5k a month to retire on then you’re going to burn through this investment at about a 6.5-8% rate which is likely to blow up on you when a market downturn happens. In essence, you could invest the money and withdraw 4-5k/mo but it will not be sustainable.

The hard truth of the matter is that you need to invest that money, let it grow and spend the next 10-15 years working, possibly in a different industry.; There will be tax implications. Your only other option is a money market account.; But I do appreciate your input and ideas. I just can't believe how much they raised the rates in the last 4 years; That's what everyone says but I have been a mortgage broker since 1998. Trump forced the fed rates to stay low and I refinanced hundreds of people below 3%. Even refi'd people into 1.99% 15 year fixed rates. Musk knows Trump is all about business.; I have seen funds like OXLC which are paying crazy dividends. Bad long term history but great dividend. If you catch it at the bottom may be a winner but def not on the safer side.; lol, the federal reserve increased the federal funds rate by 175 bps over the first two years of Trump’s term, then lowered it by 75 bps in year 3, so it went up by 100 bps under Trump prior to the pandemic.; You can talk about all the back end numbers you choose. But I work with real numbers and real homeowners trying to buy houses. The worst house in the SF area is $1m. Wi5 today's rates and 20% down your mortgage payment is $7k and that's the worst house in the worst neighborhood.

Trading strategy advice,"So every day on robinhood I’ve been day trading flipping some Apple stocks when I see it drop a little in the morning I buy it then when it goes up just .2% I sell.

I believe that’s a law that all apps must follow.; No I have a cash account.; That ""thing"" wasn't even their fault and other brokers also had to do the same thing......; im trying to get into investing now for context, just need to more about investing platforms in general; your risk tolerance is low, SO you daytrade. great fucking logic.; So what's your plan if you buy it on one of your 0.2% dips, and then it keeps on dipping, and you bought the top of the 'strong dip'?; If I have 25k combined in stocks and money, I can day trade?; You belong here ; I have FOMO 🤣💀; Sell if it goes down like .4% and wait a few days to see how things look

That’s the exact problem with my strategy though and why I want to find something better

Or maybe I should get out of this business of tiny timing the market …; Yes, total account value.; 25k or you can use a cash account if you have less but then you’re limited to one trade per day; What do you mean 😭; If you've already lost money on day trading/options if consider passive investing into an index fund.

It sounds boring but it's tried and tested and you'll struggle to beat it 👍; So sell for small gains, but bigger losses? What could go wrong; Gotcha thanks buddy.; Just make sure you are setting aside money for taxes.; Go out and make that money 👍🏼"
Portfolio breakdown and advice….,"Hey investing crew, hoping to get some productive and practical advice on where to invest my money. Let’s pretend like I have $10k right now to invest. I currently hold positions in AMZN, AAPL, COST, NTDOY, BRK.B, VOO, and MSFT.

Do I stay with what I have and pump more in? Anything you’d add? Do I diversify into something besides stocks/ETF’s?",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gab223/portfolio_breakdown_and_advice/,3,"You have heavy overlap… I suggest looking into investing in technology, renewable energy, and aerospace + defense sectors. All are projected for high growth. All will be highly profitable.; You should diversify and buy VT. 

If that doesn’t float your boat then add to VOO. 

You and I have no idea how long the outperformance of tech will last. Or when Buffet will die.; Any specific company direction you can point me in for those categories?; Also, where’s my overlap?; Overlap holding AAPL, MSFT, BRK.B, and VOO.; And AMZN"
Balancing an all-equity portfolio,"Currently holding a portfolio of 70% stocks (blue chip) and 30% ETFs (mostly SP500) in Europe. My problem is that the asset allocation is almost 100% equity. Now, don't get me wrong, it's been performing well enough, but I am starting to get worried about potential downturns (I survived 2022 successfully).

I'll admit I am a bit hesitant to sell (portions of) the high-performing stocks (AAPL, MSFT, JPM, AMZN) since they are doing very well, but I am aware that the current profile is too aggressive. Do you have any tips on how to do mediate risk gradually? My risk appetite is medium, and I still have some years left to retirement, so growth is definitely a goal right now. Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ga6jlt/balancing_an_allequity_portfolio/,2,"Get yourself enough bonds in your portfolio to feel ""safe"". Its about your own feeling there really rather than about actual numbers

100% equities held long enough will eventually lead to higher returns, but higher volatility too

For bonds

Look at global aggregate, eur hedged, acc bond ETFs - vanguard and iShares comes to mind obviously, e.g. IE00BG47KH54 or IE00BDBRDM35

Edit add-on:

10-20% would be my go-to for longterm hodling / set and forget

40% or more is pretty conservative, for whenever you really want to go into preservation mode; If you want to diversify away from equity and stocks there are sadly not that many option. The only good one I can think of is bonds. Bonds usually go up when interest is cut something that is predicted to happen in the future, so I would probable invest into bonds as these are stable and may go up in downward economic spirals. The other options (that are not good in my opinion) are:Option 1)) is gold. However, gold prices are quite high right now because of all the wars and uncertainties so it is not a good time to invest, 2) crypto but the risk of buying crypto is many many times higher than owning equity, 3) investing in the Chinese stock market or a country that is a bit removed from the western stock market, but they will have their own business cycles and downturns and their risk is higher than normal equity.; The companies you mention don't sound overly aggressive, but each person has their own risk tolerance. How diversified are you? AMZN is the only of the four stocks you mentioned that doesn't pay dividends; dividends are a good way to reduce risk.; [removed]; 100 percent equities held long enough will eventually lead to higher returns….except maybe in the case of Japan. Who knows what the future holds….we are basing all of our assumptions of equity outperformance on a period of time where the human population exploded and massive gains in available energy came into existence. Demographically we are peaked out and who knows where tech and energy are headed. Long story short…I think this mantra of equity outperformance is overplayed based on a small window of time with very favorable conditions; Your submission was automatically removed because it contains a keyword not suitable for /r/investing.

I mean.. if you throw out all historic performance (of over a century, through ebbs and highs equally..) and assume that we have reached a limit in tech and energy (as many thought for the lsst 20y+ already..) along with assuming we reached a demographic limit of what is sustainable (japan and south korea - maybe in the next 20+ years.. rest of the world is rather stable still, btw..), and somehow all of that magically really happening, then we cannot be sure what asset would actually be worth being held.

Its likely not bonds either as they would prolly default in that extreme case.. so what then?; Maybe the whole system is based on some mistaken logic…that we can continue to passively accrue gains by some simple strategy other than hard work; What primarily makes me nervous about equities is that it’s become so easy. Everyone on these investing boards just repeats the same thing over and over…just buy an index fund and you will enjoy easy returns and be set for retirement…from my experience nothing works like that. Nothing in life is easy…and when it gets to be that way and everyone is clicking champagne glasses, watch out."

Either with news about the company or saying it is a buy. I have nothing against those companies they are great but wondering about the hundreds of other stocks in the market.

Half of these are high flying pump and dump stocks.; Ionq, flnc; ASML, price drop was an overreaction to the revised guidance.; Uranium ETF; tsmc; I’ve been saying AXON for a while. I think their data will be a key trainer for GenAI. Only 33 B market cap.; PLTR, IOT, SOFI; CELH, LULU, ABNB and maybe ULTA

A quick look at revenue growth and sentiment in the macro level trends behind them I think these three could be decent picks. That said, my days of picking speculative, flashy names is over. My strategy is now mostly just buying index funds. For this reason, I haven’t done much research in to any of these picks. 

Do your research heavily. Do not buy based on this comment or others on this post.; Nike and Celsius ; I think energy companies. See: https://www.reddit.com/r/zerowallstreet/s/HtSGy6nTFI; FICO; S, ASTS, VKTX, LRMR, RKLB; Energy. The partnerships have started, but there will be more. The Mag 7 have cash they don't want to do with, a lot of energy companies don't have the cash or lobbying power the mag 7 does for expansion. 

Ai needs lots of power and creating partnerships with them is a win-win.

Industrial waste cleanup - things like oil spill cleanup, medical hazardous waste, etc

Super profitable and great moat as you have to have incinerators and special permits and landfills to do what they do.

Obesity on the rise worldwide. Weight loss drugs are going to take the world by storm once production ramps up in the coming next few years.; Insurance. 

There was enough damage from storms to force higher rates, but not enough to really hurt individual companies. Also, the 10 year being over 4% is great for their bottom lines.

Much room to grow in Latin America and maybe even Africa. Also a Buffet-backed stock. Up 78% year-to-date.; Reddit. Seriously. IMO, there is no good reason it shouldn't have a valuation of what Twitter was before Elon started effin with it. After that, there is just so much unrealized profit potential.

They have the users and that is the tough part. They just need to figure out how to turn it into dollars without losing them and I think they will. They have a lot of pulp left that all the other social media platforms have already squeezed hard.

Critics have some valid arguments, but the reality is that Reddit just continues to grow and grow. In the past year, they have started showing up basically by default in Google. While I have been a user forever, my SO who is pretty anti-tech is finally like ""everyone I know is on Reddit. I should give it a try"".

A good long average.; I like Electric Utilities. All these data centers need huge amounts of energy.; For me it is Broadcom. While a very obvious stock to some, I feel it is often overlooked by retail and mostly preferred by institutions (around 75% of the stock is owned by institutions). Some of my reasons for the coming years:

1. One of the top companies in the world typically at or around number 10 in market cap

2. They have a myriad of big customers like Apple, Google, Cisco, Arista, and more

3. Their product/service range is very wide which makes them a more stable semiconductor company compared to most competitors 

4. They are going to benefit massively in the coming years from huge growing areas like AI, cloud, data center, automation, cyber security, power generation, software, and overall interconnectivity of the world. As the world continues to integrate AI into their business they will be looking for businesses to customize solutions and chips for their businesses. Broadcom is one of few who provides such customizable chips and services. 

5. VMware is a BEAST for income and engrained in a ton of the world

6. The company is very good at acquisitions of very high revenue generating enterprises to further their income long term (even if it causes a short term hit in cost)

7. They are stellar at cost cutting unnecessary parts to boost profits

8. While Broadcom certainly sells at a premium, compared to most other big semiconductor companies, they are still a great deal and consistently provide amazing return to holders yearly

9. Some people worry about their China revenue, which yes is a risk. But if you view their world revenue sources their world ex China revenue is growing strongly yearly by year. If something happens with China Broadcom is continuing to hedge its position with more revenue sources to reduce their reliance. And in the case things improve with China, China is having their 2008 stimulus moment where they are down big, but poised for a big recovery in coming years which would only further benefit Broadcom with more spending.; RDFN, LINE, JOBY, RKLB; Quantum computer stocks have room to grow.

They argued that like Facebook and Uber stayed private for a long time using private investor money to grow their market share, and then when they did go public, they already became large cap companies.

As take rates rise it will make them more profitable. Personally I am buying it for ecommerce and fintech. It tanked over the gaming segment but to me that is a bonus if that does well.; I think SE's ecommerce segment still has further room to run. SE operates in Southeast Asia, possibly the world's fastest growing market and high volumes. If you believe in the SEA market, SE is a good proxy to invest in. SE's Shopee business has remained robust even with TikTok's emerging presence. Shopee's deep rooted understanding of the local markets and established scales mean that it will continue to be the number one player in the region, and TikTok is instead stealing share from smaller players like Alibaba's Lazada. SEA ecommerce competition seems to be heading into consolidation, with Shopee and Tiktok frontlining the market in the long term. However, there is the pertinent risk of TikTok's viability in the US, where a blanket ban on TikTok will definitely reduce global viewership and engagement. In all, SE's main revenue source, Shopee, will continue to dominate its markets against competitive headwinds. There are still other tailwinds like dropping interest rates boosting consumer spending but these have been extensively discussed.

Digital finance wise, SE owns the recently-launched SeaMoney. This is a much more competitive space with the 2021-23 digital bank craze in SEA leading to countless digital banks and fintechs springing out from nowhere. It still remains to be seen if SeaMoney will survive this initial crowding, but one thing it has going is the potential synergies from integration with Shopee, which I don't think has been fully realised yet. Consumers are still sorting out which digibank works the best for them, and while we can expect to see a few failures down the line, I believe SeaMoney will emerge victorious if SE can effectively integrate it with Shopee.

Gaming wise, SE's Garena studio owns (one of) the world's most downloaded games Free Fire, with user growth showing no sign of even plateauing. Although there is a concern over declining ARPU, these are likely due to the economic downturn and will likely recover in the coming months as we hit a broader market rebound. 

SE recently turned profitable in 2023, which is honestly very rare when looking across other SEA tech companies. While the jury is still out for 2024, second half figures are expected to be strong enough to propel SE into its second consecutive year of profitability, which I believe will likely instil greater investor confidence in the company.; Ya buddy!

If the market is doing well, rich people will celebrate by buying another Ferrari. If the market is doing poorly, rich people will comfort themselves by buying another Ferrari. Even unpopular models get sold out because the ultra wealthy need to buy them to be qualified for Ferrari's 7 figure special edition cars. Almost all their cars become collectible, I'm not sure if there are any 10+ year old Ferraris currently worth less than their MSRP. Maybe the FF.

They've got an iron grip on their brand at the moment, and they're showing interest in expanding with some of their latest models like their new SUV. Also looks like they're getting their racing division back together, they've gone from being a meme in Formula 1 to getting a 1-2 finish yesterday, and they've entered back into endurance racing. The amount of Ferrari fans and flags you see at those races are all the proof I need.

It's mostly a gut feeling on my end, but the fact that $RACE has had an annualized return rate of almost 35% since inception in 2016 and has powered through every dip and recession as if they were nothing makes me believe there's something to them.

I currently have about 10% of my portfolio in a high leverage RACE position. My hope is that the profits will pay for an actual Ferrari in a couple years time; Seems like market impatience.

Ozempic is in the hot seat right now because it’s more readily available. Lilly is still ramping up production of their GLP-1’s. Should be a huge supply increase by late 2026ish when some of their new production sites come online. 

Aside from obesity/diabetes drugs, LLY just has an incredible pipeline right now. It’s really hard to think how anyone could bet against the company right now.; As I mentioned its a contrarian pick simply because I believe the US would step in to offer them a bailout rather them go broke because of the defense business, or a break up of the company could happen.

I’m holding some at a decent entry but am considering selling if it hits mid 30s again, in the hope of a dip to buy more; The only reason they’re not bankrupt is because they issue more shares at the peak of the pumps. Last time I looked at the GME sub reddits they now believe that the genius leadership, just waiting for it to pump, dumping new shares at the peak, using those same retail investors as liquidity, is an overall net positive somehow. And that now that they’ve raised all these funds the company is positioned for a turnaround. If they actually wanted to control a significant portion of the gaming market and turn the company around, they’d have done/be doing what Microsoft did with Xbox game pass. They’d be working on cloud gaming like Xbox already has launched in beta. They’d be trying to become the Netflix of gaming, if they’d have been trying at all to evolve the gaming industry and take market share. It was theres for the taking a decade ago, but alas they’re just a meme stock now.; They aren’t spending cash on shares. They have long since stopped buying.; ...the company is a dying suburban strip mall retail chain that has not changed anything to make the business more viable.  They are closing tons of stores.  YOU gave Ryan Cohen 4 billion dollars, he has done nothing with it to revitalize the business and the only reason it is ""profitable"" is that YOU gave him a shit ton of money that now sits earning interest...because the business literally can't think of anything more profitable than earning interest on the money you gave them.  Selling shares to you is now their most profitable product and the only reason they aren't broke.  Let that sink in.; >All those shorts from 21’ still havent closed.

Short interest is below 10%.

>Bunch of artificial hate for a company that has done wonders for its business

It’s wild. Just because the stock is overvalued relative to its peers doesn’t justify the hate.

They have gone from a business that loses money from operations to a business that loses money from operations and sells shares. In just a few years time!

Revenue may be declining 30% YoY but that doesn’t matter. We sell shares.

Earnings are effectively nonexistent but that doesn’t matter. We sell shares.

There are lots of reasons to be bullish but one in particular. We sell shares.; There's a few; This is my thesis too.; Ya they're extremely safe. Long term contracts in boomer departments that hate change. Once they're in its a lock to stay in most for 20 years.; Ok.; Now, what is the AXON of healthcare?  What healthcare company is aiming to transform patient-client relationships using AI rather than to deny claims?; It just takes a really really long time to build a nuclear plant. Even if they started today it would take about 10 yrs just to get it going. Then you need more time after that to actually get your money back.; Happy to clarify: The turnaround in nuclear energy adoption started happening a few years ago and has been really been gaining momentum this year. That is helping increase the need for more nuclear fuel (which is uranium). However, even without these demand tailwinds for nuclear (in the form of reactor extensions, reactors being restarted and new SMR builds)...there was/is already a large supply deficit. The industry has been getting by through drawing down inventory stockpiles and those are pretty much depleted. IMHO the uranium bull market is only in the 3rd inning with tons of upside and large tailwinds at its back. Good luck on your investing.; No, please tell me. I love having my ideas challenged, especially since I haven't done much research into WBD beyond them losing the NBA.; Just 25 shares at 28 bucks a share.

Thanks for the info!; I can't really find anything about them having a pill on the way. Do you remember where you learned about it?; IMO, the defense division can be easily replaced, there are plenty of other companies that will gladly jump in. The real value of Boeing as an American company is that it is one of two major commercial airplane makers. In fact, it is so important that one could tell us-china relationship based on how many planes China buys from Boeing as supposed to Airbus.; As people already explained to you (and you didn't respond to), not going broke is not the same thing as being a good investment. ; What is even the bull case for lucid? I’d love for them to succeed but imo they’re late to the game releasing an $80k+ suv and since it’ll be low volume, it can’t possibly be that significant.; OK now you might consider jumping in :P; scotiabank has a $46 12 month target; I bought at $19 a few days before it shot up to $38 and I almost sold but I let the greedy give me hope for more. Kicking myself for that one but it's still doing good.; The leadership is genius. Issuing shares for free and selling them for cash. A fantastic business model.; The only reason to mess with GME is to make money off the degen gamblers on premiums selling options.  Even that is wearing thin lately.  I am gonna hold and sell calls on my 100 shares until they are zero cost basis (from premiums) or they get called away at a great profit on the next pump.  It's garbage.; They have launched multiple product lines and new services, including being an authorized PSA Grading location.  You have no clue what you are talking about.  Just because he isnt telegraphing his plans to the shorts that obviously want the company to sink doesnt mean shit hasnt been constantly happening.  You are blind or dumb to say otherwise and anyone can dive into the 8ks and see for themselves.  No debt, 4 billy, profitable yoy, and nothin but runway.  But you do you, go short it.; I made an absolute killing this year  in engineers of nuclear systems $ATRL; Plus nuclear plants are way more expensive to build then other power sources.; Beaudy! Im still trying to buy both when I can; Thank you for your input on this sub called r/stocks 👍; This is gonna sound insane but I kinda don't care that much about PE. Any time you try to make a logical choice based off of PE ratios you seem to get shafted one way or the other, I've never seen someone say ""oh I like that stock but the PE is too high so it'll probably crash"" and be right. Tesla's PEG has been significantly higher than Ferrari for years with a way more unstable brand, product, and business strategy than Ferrari, I know they're a shit example to compare anything to but I stand by my point.

Also fun fact, Ferrari's current market cap is currently only about 1000 times the price of their most valuable car (Ferrari 250 GTO). They make 13,000 cars a year for reference.; Set it and forget it vibes for me. Having to sell for this life milestone was a good reminder to take some wins and focus on diversifying better as I rebuild lol. But I’ll probably grab 5-10 a month; https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-phase-2-results-published-new-england-journal-medicine

It is still in phase 3, but should come to market within the next few years:

https://trials.lilly.com/en-US/trial/397395; I was busy working my shift at Wendy's. My reaponae is that I don't see a major defense contractor declaring bankruptcy. Its a complex process and contracts have to be approved by a bankruptcy court - not something you would want with national/defense secrets.

Nor would the government allow an outside country to take a majority stake without public hearings and I would expect the same for a PE firm.


So if It comes down to it I would expect a government bailout like Chrysler in the 80s or the banks in TARP funds.

Regardless I mentioned it as a contrary position because the market sentiment and public perception of them is highly negative right now.

I dont hold shares of Boeing, I am not short Boeing. All I am merely suggesting is that there are some interesting possibilities.

Definitely not for faint of heart or weak stomachs.; Yep i stayed away, facing too many headwinds and lost its growth darling narrative and pump. On to the next 🤷‍♂️; lol I bought at 12, sold at 14, and then bought more in the 20s to sell in the 30s 😭😂; dude do you hear yourself?  You think a dying retail chain is going to become worth more than the GDP of a small island nation because they do trading card grading?  AND they sell cheap plastic chinese third party controllers.  They are closing their stores dude.  Their stores are literally not profitable.  Name one card grading company that is traded publicly and is worth a fraction of what you think gamestop is gonna be worth.  Also, you know that PSA is it's own company right?  so big whoop gamestop can take a few bucks off the top of letting PSA offer THEIR service.  I won't even get into the massive fraud in the gamestop grading operation rofl.  

The fact you are so emotional in telling me I'm wrong and using PSA card grading and the fact they are sitting on YOUR money and doing nothing for the business with it shows me that even you don't actually believe what you are saying....you just NEED to believe it because you staked way too much cash on a bad investment and then made your entire personality about that investment.  That isn't healthy and that isn't how investing works.  

Ryan Cohen is the CEO of a PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANY....it is actually his job to give guidance to investors on the direction of the company so they can decide if they still believe in the future of the company.  ""Trust him bro"" isn't guidance that is cult religious shit.  

Why are they profitable?  Is it because of interest on the money YOU gave them?  Or do you actually think the stores they are closing constantly are making money?  

Don't get personal man, investing isn't personal.  You are free to worship ryan cohen all you want but you don't really look intelligent when you get emotional about it.  What else are you invested in?  Surely you have a well rounded portfolio that will allow you to weather losses in one investment right?  I truly hope you aren't one of those guys who lost most of their money on bbby and now are singularly invested in gamestop or other memestocks.  

In three sentences tell me what you actually think the future of gamestop is.  And just so you remember (because I know you know) gamestop wasted a fortune on stupid shit when cohen took over like that hilariously dumb nft marketplace and warehouse purchases they immediately had to sell.  They are understaffing their remaining stores.  They cut employee benefits.  That ISN'T a good sign.

Imagine telling your employee that you are a great company with FOUR BILLION DOLLARS on hand and no debt....and then cutting their benefits, reducing their schedule, and firing half their co-workers.  rofl.  Seriously dude, I can't imagine what you think a BAD investment looks like.; I agree with diversifying. I went full in with space stocks last year and was obviously veeery lucky for it to go my way. I decided to diversify so I went with RYCE and AML. AML is big sucker currently but I believe in it. Looking for some other beaten down stocks to make a position in; Sweet! Thanks for the info, I'mma certainly have a look!; Again, you just rephrased exactly your original argument. It is irrelevant whether or not Boeing may go bankrupt. That is not the bar. The question is whether it is a good investment. ; I bought at 4$ and sold at 9$ very happily 🤦‍♂️; And again - it has the potential for bottom fishing investments. Carvana was almost dead in January of 2023. No one would touch it with a 10 ft pole. For good reasons. 

Not saying its a good investment, I am saying there is some interesting potentials that none of us know yet."
My Personal Guide to Good Financial Health for People in their 20s/30s,"A family member of mine asked for some financial advice today and my obsessive self sat for 9 hours and created an 18 page ""basic"" guide to establishing good financial health in your 20s and 30s. I am proud of it and thought I would share here. While the guide is a lot more than just investing and so may not be ideal for this subreddit, I definitely think it hits some investing FAQs. 

For context, I am a 23 year old that became obsessed with personal finance at 17. I was able to hit a $100k net worth and 750 credit score at 22 prior to my peers' college graduation. Yes, I had some form of slight help from family, but I come from middle class and no money/inheritance was given to me. The point is not that I am some genius and successful. The point is that I learned some good advice online, actually followed a lot of it and want to share what I've learned. 

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: The advice contained is simply what I personally know. 99% of it I learned as a 17 year old in high school. The financial institutions/products I mention are simply what I have used and thus recommend. I understand that the companies/funds/credit cards are not perfect and there may be better options. Do your own research. I understand that what has worked for me will not work for everyone.  I understand that there are a lot of other great or better ways to go about things. I don't claim this to be a perfect guide by any means. I am 23 and not a financial advisor. It's just a guide I made initially for my cousin. It's not that deep.

Guide TLDR: Live below your means, have an emergency fund, establish your credit safely and invest what you can in a Roth IRA. 

P.S. Sorry for any formatting issues. I copy and pasted this from a PDF version which is much easier to read and has a graph and a chart I made (DM me to get it - if that's easily possible)

Evan's Basic Guide to Financial Freedom

This is my guide to have a good hold on your finances through saving and investing. This guide should give you a general idea of what to do, however it is mostly based on my own experience and what I have learned online. When it comes to what banks and brokerage accounts to use, I recommend that you do your own research and explore other options. The accounts I mention are simply what I use and so I recommend them. Different companies are always changing and improving so there may be better options out there.

5 Steps to Get Ahead in Your 20’s

\*The following steps are generally in order of importance. Ideally, you should have the previous step accomplished prior to later steps\*

Step #1 - General Bank Accounts

* ●  Open a checking and savings account with Capital One ○ Checking Account: “360 Checking” ○ Savings Account: “360 Performance Savings” (If names havechanged, make sure the account is a high yield saving’s account)
* ●  Along with the checking account, you will receive a debit card to be able to

make purchases in person with

* ○  You will also receive a checkbook with personal checks
* ○  For your debit card and checks, you can only spend what is in yourdebit card account

● Keep all of your savings in the savings account and keep $100-$500 in

your checking account  
○ When making a purchase with debit card or checks, transfer from

savings to checking  
● The savings account will usually generate 2% to 5% interest per year

which will be paid monthly  
○ Ex. If you have $10,000 in your savings, 3% would pay you $25

each month ($300 for the year = 3%)

Step #2 - Emergency Fund

* ●  Maintain 3-6 months of living expenses in a savings account
   * ○  Ex. $2,000/mo living expenses = $6,000-$12,000 minimum
   * ○  A minimum regardless of living expenses is $5,000
* ●  (RECOMMENDED) If you want to ensure you do not spend your emergency fund, open a second high interest savings account with a second bank, transfer the full emergency fund balance there and forget you have it!

■ I recommend CitiBank or Discover since I recommend their credit cards

Step #3 - Early Debt Pay Off  
\*Skip this step if you do not have bad debt or your debt interest rate is below 2%\*

● Determine if/how much you can pay extra towards your debt per month ○ I recommend 30% of your income to be for saving/investing (I

consider paying debt in the “investing” category  
■ If you have your emergency fund saved in full, you should put

30% of your income towards paying down bad debt  
● Set up automatic payments (or reminders if not possible) to pay extra

towards debts  
○ Ex. You have your emergency fund saved up and make $50,000/yr

after taxes. 30% of $50,000 is $15,000 to invest per year. You can set up an auto payment to pay an additional $1,250/mo towards your bad debt.

* ●  Examples of bad debt to pay off early include credit card debt, student loans and private loans/payday loans
* ●  When you have debt, you are losing money to negative interest. If you are able to pay that debt off and then invest the money you were paying towards the debt, you not only are no longer losing money to negative interest, but you are gaining money from positive interest

○ Ex. You are paying $300/mo towards credit card debt. $150/mo of that money is towards the interest. After you save and pay off that debt early, you now invest that $300 into

Step #4 - Credit Card

\*Skip this step if you are not disciplined with finances and may spend more than you have\*

* ●  Open a “Discover It Secured Card” with Discover Bank ○ You will be required to put down a deposit which you will receive in7-10 months so long as you pay all payments ○ You cannot spend more than your deposit so I recommend a depositof $500-$1,000 ○ Connect your general savings account and set up an auto paymentto pay off the full balance every month ○ Subscribe to email notifications and manually pay off your accountevery time you get an email that your new statement is ready inaddition to the auto-pay
* ●  Use the credit card for all possible purchases to get cash back (2% on gasand restaurants, 1% on everything else)
   * ○  To be safe and not spend more than you have in your savings,always check your savings account prior to making a purchase tomake sure you have enough money
   * ○  NEVER SPEND MORE THAN YOU HAVE IN YOUR SAVINGS
* ●  After 7-10 months, you will receive your full deposit bank and your card limit will increase from that amount to a higher amount

○ As a bonus, go into the discover app and request a higher limit every 6-12 months

■ Based on your income, monthly expenses and job, the bank may give you a higher limit, which can improve your credit score

● With a secured card you can establish/improve your credit score ○ A breakdown of credit score is included later in this guide

Step #5 - Roth IRA Investment Account

\*You can only invest in a roth if your income is below the maximum requirement ($160k in 2024) and you are investing taxed income (you must have a job and it cannot be cash under the table)\*

* ●  Create an account with Fidelity and open a “Roth IRA”
* ●  Determine the maximum amount you can invest each month based onyour income
   * ○  I recommend 30% of your income to be saved and invested (If youare not saving for a large purchase or your emergency fund, the full30% should be invested)
   * ○  $7,000 is the current annual maximum for a ROTH IRA (2024)($583/mo)
* ●  Connect your general savings account and set up automatic investing to purchase two different mutual funds or ETFs every month
   * ○  75% of the monthly investment should purchase FXAIX or “Fidelity 500 Index Fund” (S&P 500 / the US Stock Market)
   * ○  25% of the monthly investment should purchase FSPSX or “Fidelity International Index Fund” (the International Stock Market outside of the US)

■ Make sure that dividends are reinvested automatically  
○ Ex. Each month $400 is transferred from your general savings account with Capital one. $300 is invested into the US Stock Market (Fidelity 500 Index fund) and $100 is invested into the International Stock Market (Fidelity International Index Fund)

* ●  Never ever withdraw funds from this account or any other investment account if possible (unless retired or for dire emergency after emergency fund is empty)
* ●  Stick to investing in low cost Mutual Funds or ETFs (the funds mentioned above). Investing in individual stocks can result in a better investment, however usually investing in a large fund that represents many companies (such as the entire US stock market or international market) will be the safer bet that nearly ensures you will get a solid return over time
   * ○  Investing in individual stocks is gambling
   * ○  Investing looking to make money in the short term (less than 10years out) is not investing. It is trading. Trading is gambling.

Bonus Steps for your 20’s:

1. If your employer offers a 401k match, always take it and invest the maximum match amount

* ○  This is more important/better than your Roth IRA and if you cannot do both, do the 401k match instead of the Roth
* ○  If you can do both, invest the full 401K match and then invest the remainder of your investment funds into your Roth IRA2. Additional credit cards
* 2.   If you are very responsible with credit cards, will never spend morethan you have, and always pay them off each month in addition to autopay, you can receive some better benefits with more cards■ 2nd Card - Citi Double Cash: 2% back on everything ■ 3rd Card - Citi Custom Cash: 5% back on one category ofchoice (I do gas personally)
* ○  If you are an independent contractor or business owner, designate acredit card for all of your business expenses (so you can easily trackexpenses for write offs)
* ○  I never recommend getting any credit card that has an annual fee

Additional Steps for your 30’s

\*Move on to these steps in your 20’s if you can\*

1. Hire a financial advisor  
If you make enough to where you can invest more than the Roth IRA annual maximum, you should hire a financial advisor  
Make sure they are a fiduciary advisor  
A cheap option is to hire them only for flat fee based financial planning (general guidance instead of them doing the investing for you)

2. Start investing in bond funds  
Change your automatic investments in your Roth IRA so that your stock allocation is 120 minus your age

* Ex. 30 year old is 120 - 30 = 90% stocks 10% Bonds
* Ex. 50 year old is 120 - 50 = 70% stocks 10% Bonds With your new bond allocation %, set up your auto investment to purchase FXNAX or “Fidelity U.S. Bond Index Fund” Every 5 years, adjust the automatic investment to align with the 120 minus your age rule

3. If you can afford to invest more than the Roth annual limit, contribute more to your 401K

○ OR other great options include:

* HSA: Pre and Post Tax Investment account that can only bespent towards healthcare and medical costs (Tax benefits ofROTH IRA and 401K combined)
* 529 College Savings Plan: Post tax investment account (likeRoth IRA) that must be spent on a family member’s education costs (use to save for kid’s college)4. Save up for and purchase a home
* ○  While still contributing to your investment accounts, start settingaside funds monthly to save up to purchase a home
* ○  Use your emergency second savings account or a 3rd savingsaccount so that you don’t accidentally spend the money

Saving Tips

Saving is, in my opinion, the most important aspect to one’s financial health. You must save to establish your emergency fund. You cannot pay off debt without saving the money to pay it. You cannot safely use a credit card without having savings. You cannot invest without saving that money first.

Living below your means can allow you to have less stress in your life, choose a lower paying, but more enjoyable career path, spend money on “the big important things”, afford to cover emergency costs, pay for incredible experiences, retire at a reasonable/early age and actually afford to raise children.

As of 2024, 56% of Americans do not have savings to cover a $1,000 emergency (per CNBC and FOX). For many young people, in my eyes, making money isn’t the issue. It’s actually saving money. Saving money is very simple. However, it’s also very hard at the same time. If you spend less than you make, you will save money. We all know that, however, what makes it so difficult is the emotional side of it. You have to get out of your comfort zone and make changes to the way you think if you want to change your spending habits into saving habits.

Tactical Tips:  
Before you buy anything, ask yourself if you actually need it - You were

living before, weren’t you?

Wait to Buy Something - Impulse purchases are deadly. If you really want it that bad, you will still want it a week or month from now. The bigger the purchase, the longer you should wait.

Have a spending account and a savings account - Only make payments out of your checking account and only transfer from your savings when you need to. An even better method is to open a second high yield savings account with another bank. Then you can put your savings there and forget about the money. That way you can keep your spending money in your general savings account and collect interest on both saving and spending funds.

Don’t Window Shop - Window shopping can be a fun way to pass time, however if you are going into a store without the intention to buy a specific item you need, every single thing you end up buying is unnecessary. Or if you need a specific item, go straight to that item and straight to the register. Don’t browse!

Review your Expenses - Simply take 5 minutes to review your bank or credit card statements once a month. You might be shocked at how much you are actually spending. You might also find old subscriptions you can cancel.

Set up an automatic savings transfer from your spending account to your savings account - If possible, time this with your paycheck deposit. Just like with an automatic transfer to your investment account, you can just forget you have the money and you never even see it! You don’t miss the taxes taken out of your paycheck so you want to have the same setup with your saving/investing.

Mental Shifts to Tell Yourself Before you Spend Money:

“Stop using material things to fight insecurity” - Everyone wants nicer cars, homes, clothes, the list goes on. Why? Mostly because of status. We put our own value in our material possessions. Be that confident 70 year old that wears what’s comfy, drives an old, reliable car, and lives in a quaint, outdated home. Don’t wait until you’re old to realize what’s really important. Work on that now.

“The little things add up” - $2 here, $5 there, $13 here. Next thing you know, your credit card statement is $800.

“Would I rather this small thing now or this big thing later?” - Would you rather an expensive gym membership or would you rather a second vacation each year? Would you rather go out to dinner and drinks every week or would you rather be able to save up and buy a house?

“How many hours/shifts of work does this cost?” - Is buying that dinner worth it if it cost you an entire day’s work? Is spending an hour of work worth buying your lunch out vs bringing it from home? Is an expensive vacation worth 2 months of hard work or should you go the cheaper route? This also works great for commission jobs. How many cars/apartments/ect. would I have to sell to buy this?

“Saving is a tax free way of “making” money” - You can either work to make $130 and get $100 after taxes or you can just save the $100.

“What is more important to me, having nicer things or being stress free financially?” - Is that second vacation worth the stress of running up a credit card you cannot pay off? Is that daily starbucks coffee worth the stress of paying rent late? Is that nicer car worth the stress of not being able to afford to move out of your parents?

“If I invested this money today instead of spending it, I would have X when I’m older” - Use a compound interest calculator to understand generally how much your money will grow until retirement. When you are a 20 year old, each dollar you invest now should grow about 20 times itself by age 65 (10 times itself as a 30 year old). If you are 20, ask yourself if you want to spend $1,000 on something you don’t need now or have $20,000 to spend on something when you are older.

“I’m stealing money from the future me/family” - What do you value more, the novel item you don’t need right now or something you care more about in the future? Would you rather drive a nicer car now or would you rather be able to vacation every year after you retire? Would you rather spend money on yourself now or your family in the future?

“Instead of buying this every day/week/month, I invested it, how much would I have later?” - How much money could you invest if you downgraded from a $100 gym membership to a $20 membership? How much money could you invest if you got a car with a $300 monthly payment instead of $500? How much could you invest if you split rent with a roommate to pay $1,000/mo instead of $1,800. Someone who buys a $6 coffee five days a week could instead invest that $30 per week to have over $350,000 extra at retirement.

If you like to gamble/buy scratch tickets: “Do I want an impossible chance to have $100,000 today or do I want an almost guaranteed $100,000 in 30 years” - A 30 year old who spends $20 per week on scratch tickets will very likely never win big even if their habit continues for life. However, if that person invested that $20/week starting at age 30, they would likely have $113,000 at 60.

Brief Guide to a 750 Credit Score

A credit score is extremely important, however it’s something that there is a lot of confusion about. While many know what a credit score generally is, most don’t know all of the factors that determine the score and thus how they maintain a high score.

First off, a credit score or “FICO” score is how businesses and financial institutions like banks determine how qualified you are for certain services. Your credit score will be a factor in determining not only if you can get a loan for things like a car, house, ect. but also can determine what your interest rate will be on that loan. You also can be required to have a credit score to finance purchases like appliances and furniture or very commonly in order to rent an apartment. The higher your credit score, the higher the likelihood that a landlord will let you rent their apartment and later on, the cheaper your car and home will be.

Building a good credit score can take a very long time, however ruining your credit score can happen in an instant and can often take many years to repair. The easiest and most common way to lower your credit score is by missing a payment. This is why it is so crucial that you have autopay setup on all of your loan payments and credit cards.

If you have a bad credit score, you may find yourself unable to rent an apartment, buy a home, or buy a car. This is because you are seen as risky and untrustworthy. If your score is fair but not good, you will find yourself paying high interest rates. Because of this, you want to maintain a score above 700.

Credit Scores are typically seen as follows:

300 - 579 = POOR  
580 - 669 = FAIR  
670 - 739 = GOOD  
740 - 799 = VERY GOOD 800 - 850 = EXCELLENT

When it comes to apartments, you generally need to fall into “good” or better to rent. In order to get the best interest rates on loans for cars/homes you generally need to fall into the “Very good” category or better.

Credit scores are determined by the following categories below. The percentage represents how much this category makes up a score and so a higher percentage means a more important category.

Payment History - 35%  
Credit Utilization Rate / Amounts Owed - 30% Length of Credit History - 15%  
New Credit Opened - 10%  
Credit Mix - 10%

What each category means and how to do well in each:

Payment History - How often have you made payments on time?

1. Never miss a payment. Set up autopay AND manually pay off monthly.
2. Open cards sooner. The longer a card has been on your history the morerecorded payments on your history.
3. Have more cards/loans. The more lines of credit, the more on timepayments. Don’t close card accounts for this reason.

\*If you do miss a payment, #2 and #3 help. Having many total payments makes your percentage of late payments smaller.\*

Ex. If you have one credit card for 10 months and miss one payment, you’re late 10% of the time. If you have 5 credit cards for 5 years and miss one payment, you’re only late 2% of the time (1/10 vs 1/60)

Credit Utilization Rate / Amounts Owed - How much of your total credit limit are you spending? (credit cards) / How much do you owe? (Loans)

1. Pay off your cards in advance of the statement date. Manually or with autopay, pay most or all of your current balances so that the balance is very low compared to your limit. Ex. If your limit is $1,000 and you have a $900 balance, your utilization rate on that card is 90%. If you pay $850 of the balance before the statement period ends, the statement balance will be only $50 which is just 5% of your limit.
2. Have more credit cards. The more cards, the higher your total limit. This is another reason why you should not close a credit card.
3. Ask for limit increases. You can easily do this right in your banking app or call from a phone. Income, expenses, and credit score will determine the increase
4. For amounts owed, you really can only pay off debt. Save money so you can pay it off ahead of time. Don’t just make minimum payments.

Length of Credit History - How long is your average line of credit?

1. Open up lines earlier in life. If you know you will get a certain credit cardeventually, get it now.
2. Be smart about timing of new lines. When possible, do not acquire newlines of credit prior to a life event that requires good credit.
3. Have more lines. When you open a new line of credit it does not affect you as much with more lines since that line represents a smaller percentage ofthe total amount of lines. Ex. A second credit card is 50% of your lines, however a 10th line of credit is only 10% of your lines.

New Credit Opened - How recently have you opened a line of credit? 1. Follow the same first two tips above for “Length of Credit History”

Credit Mix - Is the mixture of types of lines of credit diverse?  
1. Have different types of lines of credit. There's mainly revolving (credit

cards) vs installment (loans). Ex. It’s better to have a mortgage, car loan and two credit cards rather than just 4 credit cards

Payment history is the most important by far and so it’s crucial to stay on top of all lines of credit and ensure payments are being made and made on time. If there is an accident and a payment is not made or made late you can actually call your creditor and potentially have them remove the late payment.

Keep in mind that you should never make bad financial decisions in order to increase your credit score. You also don’t want to complicate your finances. With one or two lines of credit, you can easily get a good score after just a couple years of on time payments.

Credit should not be taken lightly. If you are not financially responsible, do NOT get a credit card. The benefits are not worth the consequences of bad credit or even worse, snowballing credit card debt.

Compound Interest Explained (Why you Should Invest)

Saving is necessary in order to invest, however investing is much more powerful. When you invest, you are paid a percentage yield.  
In other words, your money grows. But the beautiful thing about the growth is that it is not linear. It is exponential.

A simplified example of this can be with a high yield savings account and $100. Let’s say the savings account has an annual yield of 5%. That means after one year, the savings account would have given you $5. However, in year 2, you do not get $5. Why? Because you are no longer being paid 5% of $100, you are being paid 5% of $105. 5% of $105 is $5.25. The next year you are paid 5% of $110.25 which is $5.51. Each year you are paid more and more because the interest compounds on top of itself. Compounding interest!

Saving on the other hand, is linear. Fortunately, high yield savings accounts do have compound interest, however the annual yield is typically much much lower than stocks and checking accounts don’t have any interest at all. If you were to save $100 every month, rather than investing it, it would look like the blue line on the chart above. However if you invested it, the growth would compound on top of itself and look like the red line.

  

Example - A $5,000 one time investment at 7% interest per year:  
\*The first number is the new amount and the second number is the amount gained in the 5 years\* Year 5 - $7,012 (+$2,012)  
Year 10 - $9,835 (+$2,823)  
Year 15 - $13,795 (+$3,959)  
Year 20 - $19,348 (+$5,553)  
Year 25 - $27,137 (+$7,788)  
Year 30 - $38,061 (+$10,924)

In the first 5 years, the $5000 would grow an additional $2,012. However in just the final 5 years (from year 25 to 30), the investment would grow an additional $10,924. That is over double the original $5,000 alone! Compound interest!!

If you contribute $7,000 annually to a Roth IRA from age 20 to 65, with an average annual yield of 7%, you would have approximately $2,140,262.34 by the time you reach age 65. Tax Free! (\*7% is a decent inflation adjusted estimate of growth based on investing in the US Stock Market\*)

Because of the fact that compound interest gets better and better the longer it works, the earlier you start investing the better. Not just better, but much better. The downsides of starting later are also exponential (same math but backwards).

Example - $5,000 invested per year at 7% interest per year: (at different ages) \*The amount next to the age is the total amount the fund would grow to by age 65\*  
18 Years Old - $1,881,579.00  
20 Years Old - $1,633,771.07

25 Years Old - $1,142,920.14 30 Years Old - $792,950.21 40 Years Old - $365,519.51 50 Years Old - $148,235.43

Each year matters a lot. The difference between starting at 18 and 20 years old is $253,808 even though you would only invest $14,000 in those two years at 18 and 19. Start as early as possible! Even if it's only $100 a year.

By the way, if you start saving $5,000 a year at 18 instead of investing it, you would only have $235,000 instead of $1,881,579. Don’t just save!

Roth IRA vs. Traditional IRA (401k)

Roth IRA taxes income but not stock growth (“Post tax”)  
Standard IRA (401k) taxes stock growth but not income (“Pre tax”)

When you are young, your income is usually low, but the investments you make will grow a lot by the time you retire. You want the low income to be taxed and not the high stock growth.

When you are older, your income is usually higher and since your investments do not have as much time to grow until retirement, the growth is low. You want the low stock growth to be taxed and not the high income. In conclusion, when you are in your 20’s and 30’s it is generally better to invest your money in a Roth IRA

\*remember that if your employer offers a 401k match, invest the maximum amount that will be matched by the company and invest the remaining money you can into a Roth IRA - The match is better than the tax savings of a Roth\*

Example #1 - Roth IRA

Income: $50,000  
Age: 25 (40 Years of Stock Growth to Retirement) Amount Invested that Year: $5,000  
Amount at Retirement: $74,872

Example #2 - 401k

Income: $100,000  
Age: 50 (15 Years of Stock Growth to Retirement) Amount Invested that Year: $7,000  
Amount at Retirement: $19,313

In example #1, you want to be taxed on the $50,000 income and not the \~$70,000 of tax growth. In example #2, you want to be taxed on the \~$12,000 of stock growth and not the $100,000 of income.

TLDR: Live below your means, have an emergency fund, establish your credit safely and invest what you can in a Roth IRA. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1g6y5mo/my_personal_guide_to_good_financial_health_for/,48,"I would read this if the formatting wasn't completely wack.; Best YouTube channel to watch and the only one you ever need to watch is The Money Guy Show; You’re reinventing the r/personalfinance wheel a bit but props to you for having this all figured out at 23. I only skimmed but there are some things I’d disagree with, like not opening credit cards with annual fees (Venture X basically pays for itself) and Roth IRA only being for those below a certain income (backdoor Roth is a thing); Damn I wish I could read; I'm surprised there isn't a small section on focusing on improving your own salary rather than just save.; My biggest regret was not establishing credit sooner. If you are over 18 and haven't yet, go to your bank and open a secured credit card. You'll thank yourself later.; Did not read lol; This is why you don't take advice from 23 year olds.; If you want people to read put this text in a google docs and have proper formatting. Then you can share the google docs itself or export it to a PDF akin to a guide.; Good stuff. As a Financial Advisor myself, you will probably pay the same for financial planning as opposed to a AUM %, and most likely the actual financial plan will be moot at age 30. Doesn’t mean we aren’t a good barrier and sound board for financial decisions and complex planning beyond a simple FP. Also, individual stock picking is not gambling. This is the big point Reddit misses about Financial Advisors too. If we took your logic as to gambling and stock picking, why wouldn’t you invest in an equal weight S&P? Couldn’t the index overvalue certain companies as opposed to others? No FA worth their salt claims to out perform the index; Nice work. I would quibble over a few points. 2% is probably too low a bar for paying off debt early. Id probably put it closer to 5%. And I wouldnt recommend ppl in their 30s or 40s put any % of their retirement accounts into bonds. The odds of bonds outperforming stocks over a 20-30 year span is remote. Having 20-30 years until retirement is a great time to go 100% stocks because you can weather the volatility.; Best YouTube channel Graham Stephan?

Dear god is this post for r/investing or r/influencers?; Wow, great job on this OP.  From someone in the advisory business, I recommend this guide to anyone who has the patience to read it; That's why you don't get married . The 6$ coffee hit hard; Sorry that’s my bad I was an idiot and didn’t realize I could just link the Google drive. Here it is properly formatted: 

[Formatted Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/184X3o59SovTJJXIuLW6XcRDEaww33Wf0K3lxinPGZzg/edit); Rational reminder podcast; Yeah I’m not a real redditor but felt like sharing cuz I thought I might help someone. I know a lot of my points don’t apply to everyone but that’s always how it’s gonna be. Dave Ramsey despises credit cards altogether but still helps so many. Like him I just feel like most people end up not getting there moneys worth from fee cards in my experience and Graham Stephan also makes the same recommendation. 

When it comes to the back door Roth, I almost mentioned this, however this guide was meant to only be 2-3 pages but I suck at being concise. There’s a million different little caveats and additional points I could add but left out for brevity.; Absolutely! My mom made me wait until I graduated HS to get a credit card. I had all of this knowledge at 17 and turned 18 at the beginning of my senior year. Really made me mad but in the end never made a big difference.; Fair enough lol. Here is the properly formatted guide on Google drive if it helps: https://docs.google.com/document/d/184X3o59SovTJJXIuLW6XcRDEaww33Wf0K3lxinPGZzg/edit; His advice is fine; Haha yeah sorry at the top I say sorry for formatting cuz I copy and pasted from a google doc which is properly formatted and I’m happy to send the pdf to anyone in a DM. I just realized now that some of the subreddits would allow me to post the attachment, however the first one I tried didn’t so I didn’t think to try on the others.

[Formatted guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/184X3o59SovTJJXIuLW6XcRDEaww33Wf0K3lxinPGZzg/edit); I think Graham connects well with young people and his advice isn't bad at all. Best financial channel, no.  [I like Clear Value Tax. ](https://www.youtube.com/@clearvaluetax9382); Wow thank you very much! Here is a link to the properly formatted version: https://docs.google.com/document/d/184X3o59SovTJJXIuLW6XcRDEaww33Wf0K3lxinPGZzg/edit; Skimmed it and generally good advice. Although I hard disagree on starting to invest in 10% bonds in your 30s. I wouldn't touch bonds until you're in your 50s. Same reason I dislike target date funds - you're overpaying for bonds that you don't need.; You should at least mention the caveats and direct them to where to learn the deeper intricacies.

People advising other folks on traditional vs Roth is one of my biggest pet peeves because they teach folks the absolute wrong things and just repeat fake folk wisdom instead of instructing them.; Savings accounts earn 200-300bps less than money market funds. Stopped reading after that; Yep there's no reason to ""scale into"" of ""dca"" into bonds unless long-term rates are very high and you want to lock those in for 30 yrs. ""Very high"" should be a higher bar than it is right now though. 4.5% for a long bond is great *in comparison* to what's been available for the past 20 yrs, but the market is likely going to trounce this rate annually on average even 30 yrs from now.

Here’s why: Right now, AI might feel limited to things like ChatGPT, but its potential goes far beyond that. Over the next 3, 5, or 10 years, AI is going to transform industries in ways we can’t fully imagine yet. We’re talking about healthcare revolutionizing how we diagnose and treat patients, transportation with autonomous vehicles and drones making logistics smarter and more efficient, and manufacturing, where AI will optimize production processes and supply chains.

Now, I know what you're thinking: 'What, you think the world is full of cave dwellers? Who doesn't know that?' and you're right. Everyone knows AI techonology will be advanced and utilized in so many ways in the near future.

But look, you can think of it like real estate. Sure, property values rise while new highways or shopping centers are being built, but the real surge in value happens once people start using them and see the full benefits. Right now, AI is still in its “under construction” phase—people can imagine the future potential, but the true value hasn’t been fully realized yet. The market has priced in expectations, sure, but once AI is fully integrated across industries and we start seeing its widespread, real-world impact, I believe we’ll see another major surge in stock prices. What’s priced in now is just the beginning—the real growth will come as AI starts transforming daily life and business on a much larger scale.

Before ChatGPT went mainstream, people assumed ‘just’ that level of AI technology would arrive soon enough, but they didn’t think it would have this much of an impact on stock prices once it came to life for the public. Everyone knew advanced AI was on the horizon, but the market didn’t price it like they do now. This shows just how much underestimation happens until we truly start experiencing the technology firsthand. And that’s why, despite what’s already been priced in, I think AI stocks are still undervalued given the game-changing growth ahead. Anyone else rethinking their portfolio with AI at the center?",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g6k31k/i_flipped_my_entire_portfolio_of_etfs_for_ai/,0,"You do moves like that in a downturn, not in a bull market top; IF you like growth/AI/Tech stocks, why not put it all into QQQ or if you Absolutely love those, 3x with TQQQ. God forbid something goes wrong at least it drown like induvial stock.; You talk about AI and the potential but are piling into all the names everyone else owns. Aside from NVDA (arguably already the most popular/widely followed stock on the planet), you're focused on the spenders and not the beneficiaries of the spending. VRT? STRL? Both up more than any non-NVDA mega cap tech names. PWR/EME/FIX/LMB/IESC/etc? 

If you think that AI will benefit industries, why not something like GEHC? If you think that AI will have that kind of a benefit in medical diagnosis, why not the largest (I think? If not, certainly top 3) imaging company? You can even ponder things like if you think that AI will have a factor in pricing and things like inventory decisions at your local store, VusionGroup in France (there's a foreign ordinary in the US but a lot of brokers charge absurd fees for that + there's next to no volume for the foreign ord) makes electronic shelf tags and WMT is a large customer last I looked. Discussion of retail/AI: https://www.vusion.com/solutions/captana/   There's a lot of ""if you think AI improves (fill in the blank industry/product line/etc) then maybe (fill in the blank stock) is worth considering.""

Energy/utilities given data center power demand? I mean OKLO is up like 100% in 5 days. VST/CEG are among the best performing stocks for the year.

You make a mall comparison and talk about the retailers but have this sort of ""Field of Dreams""-ish view of ""if you build it they will come."" What if they don't? If they don't the beneficiaries of the spending make their money anyways. 

And I'm not saying that you're wrong, but for all the hype over AI in this post, the core is that it's going to transform industries in ""ways we can't imagine yet"", which feels Cathie Wood-ish in that it doesn't entertain the possibility that the hot growth theme doesn't go 100% as hoped.  Yes maybe it will do a lot of great things but ""it's going to do everything great"" feels ""all the disruptive growth themes are going to the moon"" from 2020/21. It's just not a balanced discussion and while the potential is significant there's certainly risks. 

Speaking of Ark, they were a huge buyer of ""AI drug discovery company"" Recursion, who has already bought one of its peers (which, I guess saw a buyout as a better option than the future?) and that stock has lost 33% YTD despite being a huge buyer of NVDA chips and ""having the largest supercomputer in the pharma industry.""

Wrong move.; I would keep a balance. Say 50 etf 50 stocks or diversify somewhat. Nothing lasts forever. Also depends on how old you are.; RemindMe! 1 year; Oh boy…; lol nvda is going to crash 50% mark my words

AI is overblown; Well, good luck 👍 I'd be too worried about AI going the same way the internet did, where the infrastructure players didn't really benefit that much but the Googles and Amazons did.

Thank you; I hear you, and QQQ/TQQQ is definitely a solid option for broad tech exposure without betting on individual names. But honestly, I’m more into picking specific stocks like NVDA or MSFT because I see bigger potential there. Yeah, it’s riskier, but I’m cool with the volatility if it means a higher payoff in the long run. 😎; You bring up some solid points 👏 I’ve definitely been focused on the big names like NVDA and MSFT, which are hard to ignore, but I get what you're saying about looking at companies like VRT or STRL, the ones that are benefiting from AI spending without relying on the tech itself fully living up to the hype. I hadn’t really thought enough about the beneficiaries of the spending vs. just the AI builders.

And yeah, the Cathie Wood comparison is fair too. I’m bullish on AI’s long-term potential, but you're right that it’s not guaranteed to be smooth sailing, and it could play out more like those disruptive growth themes from a couple of years ago. Not every AI-focused company will win, and your example with Recursion really shows how even companies tied to AI can struggle.

I definitely need to consider more balance and look into those secondary plays that might be safer if the hype doesn’t go 100% as planned. Appreciate the perspective 👍🏼; I’m 31, got a house, an apartment that’s rented out, no debt, no kid, and I’m able to add about $10 - 30k to my portfolio every month.

|-|-|-|-|; 1 year is nothing. Wait 5 - 10 years.; Yeah, it may, in a near future. But my time frame is more than 5 years.; I think one difference is that the infrastructure could be distributed back then.  Cisco sold you the router, and you took it to your office.  It was yours, you didn’t need Cisco until you were upgrading.  (I realize they sold support, but you didn’t need that if you had adequate staff). With AI, things are centralizing into massive clusters owned by FAANG.  It’s just so expensive to host large models like gpt, only they can do it.  You can’t just take gpt home, you need to “rent” it, which brings in recurring revenue.  It will be super difficult for smaller guys to compete, especially when the big guys are sucking up all the chips.; That’s a smart take, honestly. I’ve thought about that too, like how the early internet’s infrastructure players didn’t get the same massive gains as companies like Google and Amazon that built on top of it. Now, those same giants are the infrastructure, and they’re playing both sides. It's definitely something to keep in mind, but I’m still betting on the big players in AI like Apple, Google and Microsoft leading both the infrastructure and the applications this time around.  
Good luck to you, too 😙; Appreciate the response. You’re totally right about tech companies being overrepresented in SPY and similar ETFs because of their success. That’s why I’m more into direct investments now. It feels like ETFs don’t provide the same level of diversification anymore. And yeah, we’re just scratching the surface of the AI boom. Seeing retail companies like Wendy’s and McDonald’s already using AI for profit optimization is proof that it’s not just hype. AI is becoming a core tool for increasing revenue, and I think the growth in this space is going to keep ramping up. Glad the portfolio breakdown makes sense to you too. Feels like the right move for the long haul!; He also gave us all the warning to brace for a downturn, which is smart. Appreciate the sacrifice, brotha!; LOL 🤓🤪; How to ""Positions""?; *You’re 

You were saying?; Yes, I'll be adding $30k of it next month.; Well his just made more then you ever will in them 24 days; But thats the whole point…it very well may not pay off 😭😂; You just blew up your whole portfolio without thinking through those things? What'd that cost in taxes? Do you always tinker and chase this much? Indexes are exactly designed for this kind of thing.; Awesome. Then go for it!  Split the new money. Make sure you have one ir two years near cash depending on how reliable your income is.; Don't get me wrong, I'm in MSFT as well (and AMZN, which you're not, but still), just a risk to be aware of :); Agreed with your post. Let's go big. I'm in the same ship.; I totally agree with the second part of the sentence.; Screenshot of your investments.; At these valuations???; Well, I'm betting on them. You're betting on the broader market. I take the bigger risk, but I'm fine with it :); This commmunity doesn't allow attachments, but I did post the same thing on r/ETFs with the screenshot you want.; Yeah it wont be fine for you once you see a 40% loss in a couple weeks when the tides turn.   
  
Nvidia gained 400% from 2020 to end of 2021, and then proceeded to bleed 70% of its value for a whole year in 2022. Etfs dont move like that. And especially since you are buying most of this stocks at their top, its hard to justify your idea.; I don't mind a short-term 50% loss of all of my stocks. Thanks :)"
Alternative personal account higher risk ,"The idea is like it sounds, I've already got a good 401k going at 4% weekly salary contribution plus 2% employer match, and I've also got my own Roth IRA setup and that's getting roughly another 2% weekly, I set it up diversified according to recommendations Robinhood gave me which have done nicely thus far, slow and steady, well I've also got a taxed personal account alongside the Roth IRA in Robinhood that I contribute roughly 4% salary weekly into, this one is for fun and to see if I can beat the others but also have an emergency fund to access at any time penalty free aside from the capital gains taxes, I plan on at least a 10 year horizon for this one, as of now it's setup with entirely ETFs, SPYV, SDVY, VOO, and SPLG. Was going to just proceed with SPLG alone from here on out, maybe more SDVY too I'm open to suggestions, but really my question, is should I just crank up the risk on this bad boy and go full port into say the top 5 stocks right now, or actually something like my top 5 picks, NVIDIA, Apple, Google, TSM, URNM. Even spread, 20% into each. What say you? 10 years, it's risky, but not so much that it couldn't just work. I call this the gamma basket. Go ahead, say it, just VOO and chill I know 😩",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1g6juuw/alternative_personal_account_higher_risk/,1,"Most professionals cannot beat the market. It's unlikely you can, at least over the long term.

>my top 5 picks, NVIDIA, Apple, Google, TSM, URNM. Even spread, 20% into each. What say you? 10 years, it's risky, but not so much that it couldn't just work

You don't understand the risk level of this portfolio if you think this isn't high risk.; Imo, limit the stock picking to 10% of contributions. You're talking about closer to 30%. 

>  I just crank up the risk 

I'm also compelled to point out that this cranks up the risk but not the expected return.; If you've got a 10-year horizon for these dollars, you might consider less liquid investments (e.g., private equity, private credit, real estate). Take advantage of your illiquidity premium!; Momentum Trading is definitely a thing. Most people set stop losses to avoid getting smacked when the trend isn't your friend.

https://www.bajajbroking.in/knowledge-center/momentum-trading

The alternative is something like the Dogs of the Dow, buying low p/e and undervalued stocks.

Both sides say there's works best... But, if it always worked, for everyone.... Well, then it'd be used by everyone...; ""any time penalty free aside from the capital gains taxes""


My friend, that isn't how this works. A retirement account is meant to be for retirement, not for withdrawals. Sure, you can be high risk in any account's holdings. The concept of the investment diversity should match your time frame. Some riskier holdings for higher payout might be reasonable in a retirement account because there is no intent to need the funds soon or on short notice. Funds you might need soon (3-5 years) or on short notice are not funds you keep in a retirement account. That's not liquidity. But also, there are no capital gains or losses, no interest or dividends in retirement accounts. All earnings here are considered Ordinary income. ; That's why I had to ask. Just wondering what y'all thought about it. I'd like to simulate it just to have it on a watch list to observe for education purposes.; SPY tends to beat the benchmark by just a little bit due to the nature of the rebalance.; Gotcha, if it’s “play money” and you don’t mind the high risk of loss, then go for it. But the concentration risk of 5 stocks is just too great for money you’d need to earmark for a future purpose"
Is having a  Financial Advisor help your portfolio?,"A couple of weeks ago I had received a phone call from Empower to promote their retirement services of managing my portfolio.  I which Empower want to manage my former employer 401k to roll over to traditional IRA and to roll over my Fidelity's Target Fund IRA Roth to Roth rollover and charging $0.89% annually to manage the account.  My individual stocks in my taxable account I was told they invest in the same stocks and have noticed how well that I have done in picking out the individual stocks.  Here is the kicker Empower had done free analysis of my accounts (Fidelity, Taxable account, Former employer 401k) and mentioned that I am too top heavy in Technology and Financial sector.  I was told when the stocks market goes down the first hit will be the technology and financial sector to lose money.  Empower will invest in growth stocks and no mutual funds.  
  
When I start talking about future contribution, I was told from Empower we don't want you to stop making contribution.  I started thinking - the more that I contribute, the more Empower will get paid.  My question is have anyone use Empower to manage their portfolio?  Have anyone have a financial advisor managing their portfolio and if so at what age did you get one?  If anyone have a financial advisor what fee is reasonable?  The $0.89% is up to 1 millions for Empower.   I'm iffy in letting anyone managing my portfolio especially having Nationwide so call to manage my 457b and the same stocks was the same stocks for the last 5 years with the same percentage for each stock.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1g6iv14/is_having_a_financial_advisor_help_your_portfolio/,0,"No. Don't pay the atrocious fees. Just roll your 401K into an IRA (create one with Fidelity if you don't have one already) yourself and invest in a low cost index fund. Voila you just saved yourself from giving away 1/5 of your nesting to unnecessary fees.; A financial advisor may help you manage risk, they will not help you improve performance. Managing investment risk realistically is usually only a concern if you’re living off your investments, ie if you have $10m or more. 

For example, let’s say the stock market goes down and tech and financials go down as well, if you’re confident in those companies, that should represent an opportunity to buy more. Just because other people are panic selling and the price dropping, that doesn’t change the company’s valuation. So why should you care? Unless you have like $100m and you’re looking to just have steady growth in your portfolio while underperforming in bull markets, in which case you may want some sort of more complex asset allocation.

If this is long term savings, just put the lot in a low fee index fund. By the time you understand enough to be able to intelligently invest in individual stocks (you shouldn’t be now) then you won’t need an advisor.; For some people? Yes. If you really just cant take volatility and drawdowns and are a scaredy cat, an FA actually does improve your retirement accumulation and outcome substantially. They help people with no financial literacy or no balls stay in the market and that makes a difference, even if they eat 1%.

But, is it optimal? No, never. Theres enough information free on the internet and commission free brokerages and tax advantaged accounts and yada yada that anyone can get 90% of the way to a perfect portfolio for them just buying low cost index etfs and then maybe diving deeper on getting long treasuries, deep value, rebalancing alpha, etc.

You can beat most financial advisors immediately by just buying index funds that dont come with a 1% wealth management fee.; Here is my take on using a financial advisor. I feel I have matured as a knowledgeable investor and I am in the simple accumulation phase and do not have a complex portfolio. I know enough not to make the common behavioral mistakes, and know I won't sell in a market downturn. When I'm close to retiring and looking at the more complex decumulation planning I do plan on using a flat fee advisor for a year or two to make sure I am on track.

First - you never hire a financial advisor to try to ""beat the market.""  If you look at the study below, 96% of Wall Street professional active fund managers cannot beat the S&P500 index over a 20 year period. Most reputable FA's will acknowledge this. 

 - **SPIVA Report (S&P Index Vs Active) by S&P Global** – compares index fund vs active fund performance https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/spiva/article/spiva-us  **Click the PDF icon to “DOWNLOAD FULL ARTICLE” and find report 1a for the stats.**

Second - You DO hire a FA if you are unsure of how to invest, or if you feel you may make fundamental mistakes like trying to time the market, panic and sell when the stock market drops, or have FOMO and chase the latest high performance stock/fund (it is usually too late by then). Vanguard published their white paper stating that using a financial advisor can add 3% to your yearly returns. But 2% of that was due to behavioral impacts like preventing you from selling at the market bottom. If you are already an index fund investor who avoids the common investing mistakes, the gain you get with an FA is much much less. The other aspects of financial planning that a trustworthy FA or CFP can provide should also include tax planning, estate planning, proper asset allocation and risk management. 

 - Vanguard’s study available as PDF – claims up to 3% gains using a financial advisor. However, the majority is in behavioral decisions such as not selling in a down market. https://advisors.vanguard.com/insights/article/IWE_ResPuttingAValueOnValue
 - Critique of Vanguard study 
https://seekingalpha.com/article/4045415-what-is-value-of-advisor-vanguard-totes-up-advisors-alpha/

Third - fees matter a lot. You want to avoid high priced funds (you want a low expense ratio) and you don't want to pay for an expensive FA if they cannot significantly improve what you are doing.

 - Boglehead’s table showing how much fees decrease your nest egg. **Paying 1% in fees over 40 years slashes your potential retirement nest egg by 33%! A 2% fee loses you 55%** https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/How_much_do_you_lose_to_annual_fees_after_many_years%3F

Fourth - realize that anyone can call themselves a Financial Advisor. However, many of them are actually insurance salesmen who try to get you into high commission insurance products such as whole life/premanent life insurance policies. There is a place for that in very rare circumstances. So proceed with caution for ""friends"" who are trying to manage your money, especially if their solution is insurance products. With a broad range of excellent ETFs and index funds available they Fidelity/Vanguard with fees from 0 to 0.03 ER, there is no need today to be paying front load fees of 5% or high ERs of 1% in funds like American Funds. The onus is on you to discern an excellent financial advisor from the perhaps well meaning but performance robbing salesman or incompetent advisor. Warning signs: ask how many funds they plan to put you into, how often they plan to buy/sell funds on your behalf, and ask for an explanation of fund overlap. Run from someone trying to put you into an unnecessarily complex portfolio (over 7 funds) or who churns your funds with frequent transactions for the transaction fees, or who doesn't understand fund overlap.; I believe you are capable to consolidate them in hopefully one account. Fees are a bit on the higher end of medium.  I will be looking at their research and unique portfolio quality. However, each time I talk to those folks I picked up new knowledge. Last week I spoke to a branch manager.  She suggested something that I missed. I gained 1-2K immediately.  After I consolidate mine I will go visit one of them for further advice. I am ending my contract with my CFP.  She is retiring after using her for 10+ years. I went from novice to advanced investor mostly learned things on my own and attend free seminars.  My own picks got lower fees and I focus on not well known mid sized stocks not big cap.; Thank you.  I was just looking at Fidelity Index Funds and they do have low expense fees of $0.12% for the Fidelity Freedom Index Fund 2040.  I do have a Fidelity Freedom Fund 2040 for the IRA Roth but the expense ratio is $0.73%.  Straight up exactly - 1/5 of my nest egg will be going to the management.

During the conversation the person have asked my salary and when I had mentioned my salary, the person got excited.  I already knew what the gain for them.  The person also mentioned besides the management Empower will help with the taxes, estate planning which account to pull money from after retiring to keep the tax bracket low.  I've already had research this last month before the Empower phone call this week.  I am 16 years away from retirement as I am 53.

What got me was they are about growth stocks and when I had mentioned about dividend stocks to have for a backup when the market hit south this will help me not to sell my shares in a down market and pull money from the dividends - that wasn't up there alley as Empower will not be making money in investing dividend stocks.; I do have individual stocks like visa, mastercard, microsoft, target, nvidia, avgo, amazon, google and these are the same stocks Empower have mentioned to me in this what they will be investing.  I also have ETF like splg, schd.  The index fund I will be looking into as my target fund of Fidelity Freedom Fund 2040 have a fee of $0.73% and I have just looked at Fidelity Freedom Index Fund 2040 in have a fee of $0.12% and both funds have the same rate of return for 5yr, 3yr, 1yr and YTD and the share of cost is the same.; Thank you for the input.  I know a coworker who flat out mentioned that they don't know anything about the stock market and let Nationwide managed their account and use CD's.  I have let Nationwide to manage my 457b for a couple of years and have noticed the statement had the same stocks at the same percentage, heck I could have done that.  I had cancelled Nationwide in managing the 457b and started researching myself each stocks, rate of return, expense ratio, etc.  I got off of my lazy butt. The information is out there just educate oneself. There are some who don't want to take the time to learned in how to invest their own money and they don't know which website to research and to ask questions, what type of question to asked.  I know some coworkers who have not check their portfolio at work to see if they need to make changes.  I have been google, youtube, Fidelity website including the free seminars, etc.  What get me is this financial advisor trying to do a scare tactic in how too much in two sectors one will lose a lot of money when the stock market crash.  I have spent today on youtube and google of this smart weighting that Empower uses.  I rather do it myself and I am doing it myself. 

I was just curious to see how many use a financial Advisor.  All of the posts that I have read on Reddit, everyone is doing their own gig (managing their own portfolio).  Empower had called me.  I was not calling Empower for help, lol. What so funny about it, I am a female, 53 years old, I just assume that Empower don't think that some women know how to research and manage their own portfolio.  If I make a bad call in selecting stocks, ETF, Index funds so be it because Empower would have done the same. It's a lesson learned in managing your own portfolio and you know what not to do the next time.; > What got me was they are about growth stocks and when I had mentioned about dividend stocks to have for a backup when the market hit south this will help me not to sell my shares in a down market and pull money from the dividends - that wasn't up there alley as Empower will not be making money in investing dividend stocks.

So I'm on board that a financial advisor is usually a waste of money, but this is a huge red flag for me that maybe you are the right type of candidate.  A dividend isn't a free lunch.  It doesn't help you avoid selling stocks in a down market at all.  Total return is all that matters.  It makes no difference if you get it in a dividend or sell a share to get it.  Zero, zilch, nada.  The only reason to prefer a dividend stock is if you believe they will have a higher overall return.  This is because a company paying a dividend drops the value of the company exactly in proportion to the dividend.

The only thing a dividend indicates is ""we don't know how to reinvest this money to further grow the company, so we're just going to return it to investors instead.""

Further, it also indicates that you want to buy individual stocks at all, which is almost certainly a mistake.  You don't want individual stocks.  You want index funds.  Whole market index funds.  BND, VTI, VXUS.  You do not want your retirement tied up in whether intel recovers or the DOJ breaks up google.  You just want to own the entire market.  This is why financial advisors are largely a waste.  This is a very easy, but also very close to optimal approach.  If you're out here stock picking with your retirement and a financial advisor puts a stop to that non sense, then maybe it would be worth it.; Thank you for your input. Thanks for clarifying the function of a dividend.  Correct me if I am wrong about dividends - the research that I have done that if a dividend payout is high for individual stocks that is a sign the company is not doing well and there is debts.  I have a couple of ETF and not index funds such as SCHD and SPLG.  I have research BND and some BND required a K-1 tax form to be completed for tax purposes.  I was researching EPD, BIZD ETF, ARCC, PBDC. ETF  There are some BND where completing K-1 is not required.  The expense ratio is high for the BIZD ETF and PBDC ETF.; SPLG is an index fund.  It's an S&P 500 index and roughly equivalent to VTI (just missing small and mid cap).

SCHD is just a bunch of companies that pay dividends.  For reasons we've talked about already, there's no reason to prefer dividends.  


>EPD, BIZD ETF, ARCC, PBDC. ETF 

I didn't go through all of them, but these aren't even all ETFs, some of them are individual stocks.  They're certainly not equivalents to BND.  BND is just an intermediate term bond index.  BND does not issue a K1.  The expense ratio is also tiny.

This is the kind of shit that makes me worried for you without an advisor, you're overcomplicating the hell out of this and don't seem to really be aware of what you're looking at.

I'm telling you, you can build a very tax efficient and effective portfolio with just the three funds I listed.  VTI is just every US publicly traded company at market cap, BND is an index of all intermediate (10ish year duration) term bonds in US, VXUS is an index of all public international stocks.

All you have to do is choose your percentages based on your risk appetite and whether you want to hold international stocks.  The whole point of indexes like this is simplicity.  With 3 funds you will have exposure to every publicly traded company in the world and a large chunk of the bond market too.

Something like 60% in VTI, 20% BND, 20% VXUS would be an aggressive portfolio for someone your age.  More like 50% VTI, 35% BND, and 15%  would be a bit more conservative.; The PBDC, Bizd, Arcc, EPD are BDC not the BND. My mistake.

I am using SPLG which is similar to VOO.  I am using SCHD which is similar to VTI.

Yes, I understand that, but I don't understand how they're relevant to the conversation or why you would even look at a fund with a 13% expense ratio.

>VTI have over 2,000 companies vs SPLG have 499 companies, see link below
https://www.etfcentral.com/compare-etfs/SPLG-vs-VTI

>VOO compare to SPLG have 500 companies, see link below
https://www.etfcentral.com/compare-etfs/SPLG-vs-VOO

Yes VOO is the direct comparison to SPLG, but it's still an index fund.  Further, it the difference between VTI and VOO or SPLG is largely irrelevant because it's market cap weighted.  VTI is more diversified, but VOO and VTI will largely track together with only minor differences due to the performance of small cap.  It's just S&P 500 (500 largest companies) or total market (of which most is made up of the same 500 companies).  It's almost an irrelevant choice between the two.; One of the reader suggested to look into index funds that's how the conversation had stated. Read the respond by "" accomplishedclub6""."

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

I own n\_0 shares in Company A at a mean cost price of c\_0.

I strongly believe the share price of Company A will continue to increase over the mid-to-long term, relative to the market average.

If you're swinging them and they don't break out in a few days this might be a good time to take profits.; It's back up to only being down like 2.5%.

The stock has had a nosebleed valuation for a while.; I think you shouldn't be buying anything due to FOMO.; They report earnings on the 30th.  Hopefully that is a catalyst for the stock; The big brands are having a hard time in cosmetics because of new low cost entrants. L’Oréal and Estée Lauder are having a hard time of it.; Yes; So many frustrated bulls and bears in small cap indicies rn.; It's going to be a highly speculative investment basically. As a company they don't make any more and they lost around 400M the last 12 months. I don't really follow the company, but they did go public a few years ago. Usually when that happens, a lot of the insiders could just have gotten a lot of equity in the company. They haven't sold a ton, which is a good sign. 

These type of investments are really tough, since the company could succeed or it could possibly go bankrupt. If you like them, go for it. I think if you are young, there is nothing wrong with taking risk, especially if you believe in the company. Just don't invest anything you are willing to risk. This company could go bankrupt, could just get bought out in which the share holders get shafted while the insiders become rich. 

There's a ton of ifs and just know you are going to be speculating more than a business with actual fundamentals to examine.; Which data? Gold having a day too.; Huh? Centrus energy still has P/E of 15. It had quarterly revenue of 189 M and net income of 30 M in June. YOY profit increased by 140%. 

I invested in it for the fundamentals. This is even before the AI hype. Now I am sitting with profit of 70%.  Are you sure you are looking at the right company?; You do know all of their board members just resigned and it’s public knowledge the ceo wants the stock to fall to buy it for cheaper, right?

Why would you buy that?

Edit: It just went up 14% after I posted this.

The market wins again.; The price action is too erratic intraday to be the result of HFTs. Institutions don't unload or sell off orders in large blocks. It might be a thin top-of-book forcing traders to accept larger bid/ask spreads.; If there really was that sort of scenario, one could be in gold and very high quality staples (ABT, JNJ, WMT, etc) , perhaps some alternative strategies (although honestly there's so few good alt funds for retail investors; REMIX is one of the few things that has done a really nice job - so far, at least - actually being an ""all weather"" fund and largely avoiding the decline in early 2020 and 2022 while participating to a decent degree in up periods.)  Defense ETFs, but that's really a buy early thing - it's like when people ask about hurricane beneficiaries as a hurricane is making landfall rather than buying them when there's early indications of a hurricane. 

Do I think that there's clear indications a recession is likely in the near-term (6-9mo?) no.; Preliminary Q3 results were bad as the company continues to have an inability to predict the extent of the issues they're currently facing.; They're replacing their ceo; Walgreens is also closing a bunch of stores. The drugstore sector is struggling; good catch 📈; Look at the brands that have been advertising here, it's gone totally mainstream. RDDT definitely needs to improve their ad serving platform to deliver the efficiency advertisers are used to with GOOG/Meta, but I think it's only up from here for RDDT. Especially when you consider they are going to have a massive leg up on Meta/GOOG when the world goes cookieless. RDDT doesn't rely on cookie tracking to target ads based on interests since this site is conveniently organized into very niche communities for users. 

  
People will call me crazy, and that's fine, but RDDT is a legit 10 bagger opportunity. I'm already up 100% and they're literally just getting started with monetization.; Wonder how much them selling user data to openAI made. I never thought they would have enough profit vertices, but selling data to Bloomberg and OAI must be working out. I need to add reading their 10K to the list.; wait for it to get a wee bit higher and then buy a put that's 6 months out.

Buy a cheap one just as an experiment; Could it? Yes. There could always be a downturn ""next year."" Do I see clear indications of a near-term (6-9mo) downturn right now? No. 

Could there be a correction after the market becomes short-term overextended? Sure. 10% corrections used to be viewed as normal and healthy for the market.; SPLG and QQQM.; I'd personally call it the Mag 5. Avoid Tesla and Apple. Tesla already has perfection priced in, and it's far from it. Apple isn't growing anymore and it's P/E is like 36 or something crazy like that, for a company that isn't growing

Others to consider for long term holds include:

TSM (although recently got a lot more expensive)
PANW (my personal cybersecurity pick)
ASML (although I'd try to wait for a bit cheaper like $635)
AVGO (pretty expensive right now, but if it dipped to $161 maybe)
AMD (anytime it's below $154); Have you read the news? It’s not going up on nothing.; After Ath yesterday; I think they dropped more because they are priced unlike any other car company, but so far nothing but cars is really materializing; Incredible how people make enormous leaps from tiny pieces of info. I asked chatgpt to summarise the obvious flaws in your logic. Here you go:

“Your frustration with auto-type is understandable, but you’re confusing a single tool’s limitations with the entirety of AI. Auto-type is just one narrow application of AI, and it’s far from the pinnacle of what AI can do. The same technology you’re dismissing powers advanced medical diagnostics, autonomous vehicles, and countless other systems driving innovation in nearly every industry. Thinking AI is “fake” because voice recognition isn’t flawless is like saying electricity is a hoax because your lamp flickers. It’s an oversimplification of an incredibly complex and evolving field.”; Do you honestly think that correcting your typing errors or recognizing your voice is exemplary for the progress that's being made in the AI space? Priority-wise big tech couldn't care less about that.; No one can answer this question without knowing the current fundamentals of the company; Good question, Company A is approaching a double goblin head top formation based on the stats but has more room to grow before a top. 

I’d recommend buying y*X% more of Company A then slowly phasing into Z% of Company G as it’s grown is deterministically going from c_0 -> c_999 (H% growth) in the next year. 

Good luck!; Watch out for the inverted brainlet formation when looking at the chart of Company A. It will tell you when the headwind is too strong and ideally you then wait for the double turd bottom before reassessing directionality.; It's been 8 years and RDDT cost my kids the chance to go to college, my wife left me, and booze is my best friend.; I will be messaging you in 8 years on [**2032-10-18 15:36:47 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2032-10-18%2015:36:47%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g6e1gc/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_oct/lsjib1b/?context=3)

|-|-|-|-|; Idk, it seems like they have no resistance to price increases yet; Especially when all media companies are Dead Men Walking in about 10 years.

Have you seen this?

https://www.reddit.com/r/midjourney/comments/1g2lazn/the_kaiju_event/

Watch that little video for a while, and realize that this is literally the worst it's ever going to be, and it's only going to improve exponentially every few months or so.

I think all media companies are dead in about 10 years or so.

My theory is, there will be illegal programs that somebody can download, that will allow you to make basically any movie you can possibly imagine, any TV show, any video content that you can think of. You could put any actor into any role with any voice. You cut put yourself in the movie in the lead role, or as a supporting actor. You could fill the roles with friends and family. There will be endless alterations you can make.

You'll be able to tell the AI exactly what you want and it will be able to whip it up for you in about 2 minutes.

There will be publicly traded companies like Disney, Netflix and Comcast that will offer ""official"", legal versions of this software, but anybody using a VPN can just download an illegal version, and the illegal versions will be way better, because you'll be able to add nudity and ignore copywrites and trademarks.

Nobody is going to want to use any of the official ones, because you won't be able to do any of the really cool things with it. There will be too many restrictions due to nudity/language restrictions, forced wokeism, copywrites, trademarks, etc.; GOOGL is a major disappointment. Will be selling when (if) I break even; I think you mentioned it a bunch of times on this board last year.  Just took me a while to look into it and open a position.  I bought in the 60's and it's been a star performer since then. So, thank you!; Must be nice 😂; RBRK definitely breaking out.; It's close to my optimistic call of $2900. Regardless of the possibility of an early pullback, the macro tailwinds are too strong to ignore.; Nice can't wait for Peter Schiff to boast about it; The global financial crisis and Covid helped drive major divergencies between our economies. US and EU GDP was similar before 2008, and is growing further apart. ; Youre right, only at 50x is it fairly valued; I'm samll time investor too lol. I assume LEU has a long way to go. The P/E is still just 14. It already has proven revenue, even without AI, unlike many other speculative pre-revenue companies  (see SMR). It is being rewarded for it. I'm gonna not open my account for a month to avoid temptation of selling it lmao.; I invested in April on whim. But it is a tiny amount \~ 1.5% of my small portfolio. Now I'm up almost 40%. Valuation is crazy high but they are beating earning expectations consistently and machine operated surgeries is only picking up. My average price is at \~370, so a PE range of 60. I'm happy holding there for now. Revenue growing at \~13-14% each year, and with aging US population, I will hold it for a LONG time.; Thanks! I've been waiting my entire life for your wisdom.; Dang; thank you; They released some data which alleges that their economic metrics have beaten all their targets. Plus the PBoC announced it will allow select banks and brokers to pledge held fixed-income securities to the PBoC so they can finance stock purchases. Basically freeing up liquidity for the stock market that's not tied to the housing sector.

Which reminds me, I have to increase my gold allocation. I have a significant stake in silver but not enough spread among gold miners/royalty companies.; >Huh? Centrus energy still has P/E of 15. It had quarterly revenue of 189 M and net income of 30 M in June. YOY profit increased by 140%.

The current GAAP P/E is 14.5; the forward GAAP P/E is 26.49. When you deconstruct LEU's balance sheet and remove the GAAP distortions, you get much higher valuations as LEU includes many things in its earnings category that inflate its value. At $56 it was 51 P/E. That would make its current P/E around \~89.

LEU's revenue stream is extremely blocky and not seasonally predictable. Note that in Q1, it missed revenue and earnings expectations by almost as wide a margin as it beat them in Q2.

>I invested in it for the fundamentals. This is even before the AI hype. Now I am sitting with profit of 70%.  Are you sure you are looking at the right company?

Yes, I am looking at its cleaned-up balance sheet over the last 5 years. Certain segments of LEU's fundamentals have deteriorated over this time.

Here is the return on assets, EPS, and P/E from 2019 to 2024:

|Year|P/E|EPS|ROA|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2020|18|4.56|53.9%|
|2021|16.3|2.80|52.4%|
|2022|41.4|3.84|31.2%|
|2023|65.0|4.39|26.0%|
|2024 (current)|89.4|1.48|8.7%|

  
In terms of positioning within the industry, LEU is one of the best picks. I'd certainly bet on it over LTBR, CVV, and the other uranium miners who have worse financials. But all of its recent gains are the byproduct of speculation regarding government support of nuclear energy instead of the company improving its operations, and that makes it a dangerous play.; Yeah, some of that hadn't happened when I initially bought up their stock. I also didn't exactly drop a ton of money on them thankfully.

Edit: Yep, that jump just put me back into the positive :D; How about lrcx, klac, amat, and other chip stocks?; what's propelling Apple right now while rest of Mag7 stagnates?; Maybe good news, but these are still nosebleed valuations for a company whose innovation is stagnating; When every other car company is wanting in, they have some pull. Everything is materializing because of TSLA. I think it should be worth a couple Ts at least; Put all your money on Tesla, that’s also proven; Don’t care what anybody says, I’m not gonna watch my account go down 60% whenever this bubble burst. Not saying don’t ride it up. Just be careful.; So whack that he wont tell us the stock 😂; Careful, as I explained in my other post there is danger of an inverted brainlet formation which is a quite bearish signal in a falling interest rate environment.; np! Always do your DD before buying anything off here. I'd had some hits, but also some misses too, like I was really into OLPX, but that was a disaster pick. That's one thing I've learned over the years, you can't win every single pick, but the good should out weight the bad. 

Still bullish on my investment thesis I've been saying here for years, that I want to invest into companies that deal with electrification, physical data center, companies that will have tailwinds because of the IRA/infrastructure bills, and HVAC. 

Like one my favorite companies kind of hits all those sweet spots, IESC. Post about them too when they were like 40 bucks or something. 

Like this list from 9 Months ago is pretty crazy: 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/199n58k/comment/kig9ejz/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/199n58k/comment/kig9ejz/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

Too lazy too look at the 9 month performance, so here's the 1Y mark on all the names listed: 

STRL - 120%

FIX - 162%

MOD - 220% (that's really creemeseasons pick) 

POWL - 25%

NVT - 53%

CLS - 121% 

PSTG - 66%

That's the one thing that has helped me personally. Not sure if it works for everyone, but I'm pretty good at looking at macro trends and being to think about what should do well in the next 5 years or so. Then from that idea, I screen and look for companies that I define as solid businesses. 

That's one thing that people will differ, but personally, I like to look for companies with not a ton of debt, gives them flexibility around M&A as well lower the overall risk of the company going bankrupt. Then personally, I'm less of a PE guy, but rather look at PEG. So I try to find things that under 3-2, since the market is kind of pricy. Then look for companies that offer good ROIC and have been growing both EPS and if possible revenue.; I don't know who that is nor do I care.; Clearly the market disagrees with all your sentiment as it pushed towards ATH on a contiuned base, while weed stock doesn't do anything. But it's your money to lose or miss out on gains.; Just bouncing its head on the ceiling for the last 2 hours... let it grow!! I hate people so much lol; Totally. There’s nothing wrong with risk, just be careful. Like my lotto ticket stock is RKLB.; Solid.; Which royality companies do you favor atm? There is a bunch out there and it looks like you spent some time researching them.; Ok I'll be honest - I don't understand most of your comment lol. I was looking metrics on Google Finance tab and in Morningstar website. Both give EPS of 5.44 and P/E of \~15. The revenue has been increasing for past 4 years with profit margin >\~ 25%. I don't understand how the P/E can go from 15 to 90. If that is indeed true then is the company is cooking up data? I'm confused lol.

Can you give me a link to your data? Or are calculating it yourself based on the earnings reports?; Well a win is a win.; I don't really pay attention to those.

A small cap semi I'm kind of interested in is Lattice Semiconductor.

LSCC.

More as a swing trade. Buy in around $47 ish, sell off around 72 ish.; Did Nvidia get kicked out of the Mag 7 and I didn't get the memo?; Their innovation is absolutely not stagnating. Try look at Apple Vision Pro, there’s nothing in that class on the market.; First mover advantage is powerful but Tesla hasn’t done a lot with it, and I think they are getting dinged because they hyped up projects that are very far out or unlikely to materialize meaningfully like fsd and robots; An initial catalyst doesn't have to remain important forever. Tesla is not the best car maker, and not the best car self driving taxi available. To me space x and their superchargers will end up doing better than their efforts in the auto industry, but I'm staying away from the stock because of overvaluation; Tesla in my opinion will eventually fail as a company almost completely. And Musk I believe will increasingly be seen as more akin to a conman with very shrewd business abilities, than a genius. Any reason why you’re holding up Tesla as the pinnacle of AI when it’s clearly not the case? Did you lose a lot of money investing there? 

Seems like you’re also disregarding the argument I just provided that clearly explains the flaws in your logic and the how AI is already a huge part of the economy. Stubbornness and ignorance isn’t going to help you become a better investor.; > Not sure if it works for everyone, but I'm pretty good at **looking at macro trends and being to think about what should do well in the next 5 years or so. Then from that idea, I screen and look for companies that I define as solid businesses.**

Agree - that's my primary focus as well.; a lot of people were saying the same thing about growth stocks in 2021...; The price is just a line on a screen. Whether or not the valuation justifies putting capital at risk is the more interesting question. Stocks are at nosebleed valuation, and the fact that the stock market keeps ripping higher is not an argument that the valuations are warranted. What is in my portfolio is neither here nor there when answering that question. I have not advocated for purchasing those stocks. It is within my personal risk tolerance. ; The major royalty companies are suffering from a dearth of cost-efficient assets in their portfolios, so I expect them to pick up the M&A cycle over the next year. Franco-Nevada and Newmont are the default options if you want safe exposure to gold. I prefer Agnicio Eagle and Northern Star as overall businesses.

The small royalty companies that I really like at the moment are Royal Gold, Sandstorm, and Altius.; > Ok I'll be honest - I don't understand most of your comment lol. I was looking metrics on Google Finance tab and in Morningstar website. Both give EPS of 5.44 and P/E of ~15. The revenue has been increasing for past 4 years with profit margin >~ 25%.

Yes, I know that's what the official 10-K and 10-Q reports say. Unfortunately, retail investors are rarely privy to accurate accounting data. The buy side never takes 10-K and 10-Qs at face value: they pay their analysts to pull apart and rebuild financial statements so they can discern which companies are good investments.

> I don't understand how the P/E can go from 15 to 90. If that is indeed true then is the company is cooking up data? I'm confused lol.

Yes and no. The problem is with how GAAP allows companies to categorize revenue, earnings, goodwill, free cash flow, etc. They get considerable optionality in what they include or don't include. This means company balance sheets are incompatible. Even if they're in the same GICS subindustry, they are using a different set of criteria for what are putatively the same metrics. Additionally, they get penalized when their accountants aren't savvy enough to play the game properly.  

Mind you, for the last two decades the correlation between stock prices and earnings has considerably strengthened. Investors expect earnings to continuously grow and beat analyst expectations. It is in the companies' best interests to fudge the headline numbers to make themselves look as good as possible. 

I don't know if LEU does any tomfoolery as egregious as Soundhound labeling contract termination fees as revenue, but their official reports don't match the database I'm using. And I trust the latter far more. 

> Can you give me a link to your data? Or are calculating it yourself based on the earnings reports?

If you're willing to shell out several thousand dollars, sure! 😁 That's how much I pay to access this information.; So why has revenue growth been in the low single digits recently?; They basically own the future in cars and space travel and bazzucas and fsd and robots now.; With all of his rockets blowing up constantly, everyone already sees Elmo as the con man that he be. He’s never invented anything. He’s never done anything. Well except for blowing up rockets over California, which is an out for being too far right. How long before California also dance Tesla from the state? That will kill the stock price. Or, it might help it because they’ll move to coastal state where they’re allowed to do business. That would be sad. His stock was sore. He would make so much money. ; No man, I didn’t lose any money. Sorry I just woke up too early. But I guess I was trying to say looking back be cautious about AI, let’s all enjoy the ride but get out in time.; Yeah. I've come to learn over time, that not every investment will work out well, but I've been saying that idea of HVAC, physical data center, electrification, onshoring, and government spending via the infrastructure and IRA act as macro tailwinds for years in this sub. 

I'm a software engineer, so the data center stuff made a ton of sense and kind of falls into buy what you know style of investing. 

Never try to think of myself as an expert, but at least using a screener has taught me discipline and how to find a style of investment. Pair that with being able to think for yourself about trends, you can see success. 

I always talk about that's the main reason why I think people underperform the market in general. They don't think for themselves and they don't do things like screen for companies, because that takes time and research. Much easier for people to get a tip from someone or online and run with it. 

Like some of the newer stuff I've been buying into is around naval companies and components for drones. 

The naval stuff is because we are way behind in the US in what we need and we don't build here. 

[https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/05/17/us-navy-ships-shipbuilding-fleet-china-naval-race-pacific/](https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/05/17/us-navy-ships-shipbuilding-fleet-china-naval-race-pacific/)

>The United States [effectively gave up on](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/04/us-navy-oceanic-trade-impact-russia-china/673090/) commercial shipbuilding during the Reagan administration in the name of free trade. In the decades that followed, generous [state subsidies](https://www.csis.org/analysis/hidden-harbors-chinas-state-backed-shipping-industry) helped China dominate commercial shipbuilding, and Beijing’s requirement that the sector be dual-use resulted in an industry that can shift to production and ship repair for the military during a conflict, much as U.S. shipyards did during World War II. The U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence estimates that China now has [232 times](https://www.twz.com/alarming-navy-intel-slide-warns-of-chinas-200-times-greater-shipbuilding-capacity) the shipbuilding capacity of the United States.

>Rebuilding the arsenal of democracy that anchored the U.S. victory at sea 80 years ago won’t happen overnight or cheaply—it is a generational project.

But in last week all banks stocks are beating earnings expectations, Netflix beat expectations, TSM beat expectations, Intutive surgical beat expectations. Maybe megacaps are overvalued but I have seen more companies beating expectations than not. Only ASML comes to mind that disappointed.; But this is not answering how P/E can be so different. The price of stock is same for everyone. So PE of 15 vs 90 can only mean that real earnings are 6 times smaller than earnings reported to retail. Not 6% but 6 times - so 600% smaller. I don't care if LEU is a good company or not - but if a company is openly cooking up numbers so much that earnings can differ 600% between different metrics, then I have bigger worries.

I understand your data is from a paid service, but can you give me a link? Atleast to the service?; Try looking at EPS, 23% per year over the last 3 years. 
China has been a problem which is why growth is low right now. But this is expected to get better hence the valuation. There is massive growth in services, IPhone 16 supercycle, and when AWP is rolled out to the masses it will also be a massive growth opportunity. 
You can’t just look at PE, you have to look at all the fundamentals.; BYD owns the future in cars, which has shown up in their exceptional pricing power endowed to them by the Chinese state. FSD and Robotics I would argue are split by other companies. Waymo leads the pack in actually useful FSD, and Tesla does not have a single useful robotics product out in market. So what the fuck do they lead exactly at a valuation higher than cash money printers like V, MA or very dominant companies like ORCL, COST, or CRM?; You really think these TRILLIONS of dollars are being spent on something to just go nevermind, we were wrong, its actually not going to do anything, on to the next fad. You sound like the guy looking at the 1st wheel saying it's nothing more than a cool table top; Came across CNRD and thought I'd throw it over to you for your shipbuilding ideas. Haven't looked into it much, but it's out there!; Came across this as well: [https://taskandpurpose.com/news/army-watercraft-readiness-report/](https://taskandpurpose.com/news/army-watercraft-readiness-report/)  
Though I'm not sure what would be the best investment options for this play.

I recently bought LECO for ship welding and ORN for marine construction.; > I don't care if LEU is a good company or not - but if a company is openly cooking up numbers so much that earnings can differ 600% between different metrics, then I have bigger worries.

Everything management is doing is legal according to IFRS, FASB, IASB, and whatever accounting organization you want to name. ""Cooking"" numbers has been standard on Wall Street for decades, and underreporting is just as prolific as overreporting. This is why asset management firms like BlackRock pay tens of millions for proper data analysis. 

> I understand your data is from a paid service, but can you give me a link? At least to the service?

I'll do it in PMs.; It had a similar growth in EPS in 2018 and PE ratio was HALF of what it was today. Andy stimulus from CCP is not going to fix China’s deep structural demographic problems.

If it’s such a great opportunity and has room to climb, why did Buffet decide to sell much of it off but keep other stocks?; Just the fact that BYD is Chinese made keeps them from being the future of cars. They own the future of electric bikes and scooters, never cars. That's Europe and Americas.; There is viable technology that will be worth a lot, however, obviously a lot of these companies are overbought in 2024; Interesting! I'll look into them over the weekend. Never really look outside of like the bigger exchanges, saw this on the OTCMKTS. I'm just a sucker for using Finviz a ton, so they don't get info on that exchange.; Another one

https://www.thewirechina.com/2024/10/27/americas-sos-us-ships-china/?continueFlag=93ed27cd2cd725fa5a9c89ebaee07304; Me too please! Your analysis is insightful—I'm curious how I can start doing the same.; You’re clearly no very experienced. Apple was way to big a part of BRK’s portifolio, and needed to be reduced. I love when people bring this up, because if he did not believe in Apple, it wouldn’t still make up for 31% of public traded portifolio, and 10% of their overall assets. 
It’s normal to sell some of you’re winners when it grows to big in you’re portifolio.; I doubt it. The consumer has been stressed financially for years, and it's only a matter of time before concessions in car manufacturing are made to the Chinese. If the US/Europe really wanted to compete, we would have seen cheap EVs by now.; Yeah, I generally avoid them too, unless it's really a good deal. However, the company that runs them, OTCM is actually a really cool company.; Ok, fair point about Buffets holdings. But why should Apple’s PE be 35 when it was 18 in 2018 (yet EPS was higher than it is today!); I’m not sure where you get the higher EPS from? Does it take the split into account? Because EPS is a lot higher today: https://companiesmarketcap.com/apple/eps/

It’s all about future expectations, their future was much more unsure in 2018 than today. And the Apple brand worth much more today, as brand loyalty is much stronger."
Are lithium battery stocks a good buy?,"Lithium batteries are used in the majority of devices we use every day; Laptops, Electric toothbrushes, E bikes, Electric tools, iPhones, vapes etc. they’re even used by manufacturing businesses within their heavy machinery and vehicles - FLASH BATTERY, these batteries are the most popular in Italy specifically and require 0 maintenance while also charging very quick compared to others available.

More importantly, with the ongoing climate crisis, governments of more economically developed countries are pushing their citizens to ‘go green’, promoting electric vehicles, bikes and even solar panels (solar panels can use lithium batteries to store extra energy). 

I am also aware however that sodium ions are a direct substitute to lithium, charging Even quicker and have an even greater life cycle. We seem to just be getting started with sodium ion batteries as the raw material supply chain isn’t very well developed.

What do we think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g4x31u/are_lithium_battery_stocks_a_good_buy/,23,"I've held $ALB for almost a year, looks like I'll be underwater for quite awhile; Not right now. Oversupply of Li and market is flooded with raw material causing recycling Li company on the brink going bkrt.  I own severral stocks lately they are all under water.  In fact, that summaries the state of alternative energy program in general.; No.  There is an oversupply for the next few years, and prices will be depressed.; ""What do we think?""

Going to be unpopular on a sub that wants to like every theme like this, but imo most battery stocks don't have a lot of moat and a lot of it feels like a commodity product. People were piling into things like QS and FREY 2-3 years ago and all those names are still down massively. Panasonic was talked about for a while - their stock has gone nowhere for decades. The LIT etf is down about 55% off the peak. 

""More importantly, with the ongoing climate crisis, governments of more economically developed countries are pushing their citizens to ‘go green’, ""

Green is good but ultimately there has to be the realization that a lot of people can't just go out and buy an EV or solar and if interest rates are high, that will further impact both. ""An EV in every driveway and a solar panel on every roof"" is not realistic as much as people would like it to be. 

Also, for all the govt push into clean energy, people talked about it as a ""sure thing"" and ""easy money"" after the election in 2020 and piled in towards the end of that year. The top in ICLN was January 2021 and it's down around 60% since. Higher rates haven't helped but it was headed lower before that. 

EV adoption would be improved by further investment in infrastructure but 7.5B allocated to chargers in 2021 lead to 0 installed by late 2023. https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/05/congress-ev-chargers-billions-00129996. CHPT is down 97% from the peak - can charging be a business that can sustain itself?

Invest in lithium? ALB is down around 70% since 2022. It's still ultimately a commodity and when the cycle turns names decline significantly. That can lead to opportunities, but eventually prices go up to a point where more supply comes online, the stocks tank again and the cycle starts over.


TLDR: Green is good but I think 1) there has to be some view towards realistic levels of adoption and understanding the impact of higher rates (especially if we're likely not going back to the ultra low rates that were in place for many years) and 2) it still has to be a good business at the core with strong management, a compelling product and strong moat - investing in something because it's simply a ""disruptive"" theme and you're investing like Cathie Wood.; Are you asking short term or long term? 

Sodium has been done before…they just ended up back at lithium ; Are we time travelling to 2021?; 

Lithium is super abundant on the planet ..so will never be a shortage. There is something like 5x more nickel in lithium batteries than there is lithium.

If you want to put your money on your thesis, put it in nickel.; You're late to this party.; Ask the gentz @ varta how they feel about that.; Lithium extraction is where it's at. Give me my $1000 per acre already; The largest companies (by % market share of worldwide lithium battery production) in this space are BYD and CATL. Lithium hydroxide/carbonate producers are probably not very good investments either since sodium ion batteries are likely to be a constant threat to their margins  going forward.; Someday, yes.  Maybe even now.

I wouldn’t get hung up on “new tech will replace Li-Ion” hype.  People have been saying that for 45 years and so far, nothing is more viable than good old li-ion.

If the actually comes that there’s a mass market replacement, it won’t be overnight news, it will become a gradual realization over a decade or so, and you’ll have many chances to sell lithium and buy unobtanium or whatever.; I made a fear-greed index of common lithium stocks --> [https://ibb.co/3p4Hk0Z](https://ibb.co/3p4Hk0Z)

They started to flourish post covid. The past few months June, July, August no one hardly ever considered investing in them. So much fear, so many articles why lithium is a bad buy. All of the sudden because of some lithium deals people want to get into the sector, lithium stocks are rising, people discuss them, making posts. Although they are down if you zoom out, the entire sector in its current form is greedy and saturated

If you'd ask me, now is a bad time to buy into lithium. 3-5 months ago i would have commented ""go for it. the probability to gain percentages is bigger than the the risk to loose money"". Now it's vice versa

    ['SLI', 'SGML', 'LAC', 'PLL', 'FREY', 'LAAC', 'AMLI', 'ATLX']; Yes - everyone needs batteries
No - competing tech is looking for solid state batteries, material science is advancing quickly
Overall - nobody knows, probably ok for a 5year horizon; SMR stocks; Look into NEXT SOURCE MATERIALS - graphite - NEXT.TO; They are commodities; Lithium has been shorted to the depths of hell due to special interest groups, namely oil, or those with oil investmens. At these low stock prices, it influences public opinion to also be bearish. Opinions can change literally overnight based on stock price. 

However if you believe in basic mathematics this is a golden investment period. A single chatgpt inquiry uses  10 times more energy than a single fight search. Power demands are growing exponentially to the point that Microsoft, and Google are pushing for nuclear energy.

Regardless of energy source, even oil, stationary storage demand will grow exponentially. Tesla's fastest growing department by far is it's energy storage. 

If you are looking for a low risk investment, a mix of the larger ones will suffice. If you are looking for something more high risk, high reward, several battery companies have become public over the years. I'd stay away from any that are still struggling to manufacturer anything, miners are also high risk and more so a commodity. The manufacturering scene in high capex, and we have (and will) continue to see consolidation. Like semis there will only be a handful of big players left. The biggest asymmetry on the market is probably Microvast. Shorts have taken it to a $70M valuation on what is probably $400-500M in revenue this year, with $60-$100M in cash, and $600M in assets. The stock price is so low that it may get delisted by Q2. Biggest High risk, high reward opportunity in this sector IMHO.; I invested in Expion360 like an absolute Ape, without looking at the Financial Statements a couple months ago…; I actually just bought 2027 calls this week.; Yup this. Also add in the discovery of the largest ever oil deposit in the US and we will see no shortage of Li in the foreseeable future. Additionally, the Chinese are working on sodium battery tech which has a significantly faster charging rate compared to Li means that Li will fall to the wayside.; If they’re all under water, sounds like a good time for me to go all in. The WSB route 🙌; So realistically if you want big gains ur gonna have to take the risk and invest in businesses on the brink of bankruptcy during the times of over supply and little demand in the next few years? But then sodium ions might be the go to by then?; Very insightful. Going to reread this after my dog walk and see if I’ve got anything to reply to; Bit of both; Well, in a sense yeah.. Tesla’s Lithium battery provider’s contract that started in 2021 ends this year haha. May be expecting a jump in somebody’s stock price 👀; This is so dangerously wrong and ignorant…you don’t know what you’re talking about….it’s not economical to mine most lithium….lithium that makes economic sense to mine is not abundant.; Just some extra thoughts I’ve gathered through a website called ‘Gaz’

Apparently 70% of the world’s produced lithium is currently being used in batteries. 

One ton of lithium requires 1.9 million litres of water to extract. This seems quite contradictory to the ‘Go Green’ agenda pushed my EMDC Governments

Lithium isn’t easy to obtain - existing deposits might not even be accessible with the current tech we have available

Nickel is also apparently depleting, however is very easy to recycle

I wonder if with all this taken into consideration, Sodium Ion is a greater buy? I’ll need to do more digging but I’m about to take the dog out haha.; Sure, I’m late, but the party surely isn’t over yet… Imagine a future where the US and UK only produce EVs

Is that far fetch and pure imagination or is that really what our governments are striving for?; So? Not sure I understand your point, my bad.; This is why its so important to not let these speculative investments turn into a big loss. wait till the chart starts turning back up, you can see that happening in $ALB right now. There's no rush to buy into this stuff, patience pays, if you like the fundamentals wait for the technicals to start confirming your thesis. If it then starts reversing and going lower cut your losses and be patient.; Happy hunting to us all; Strike price? I’ve been looking at leaps as well.; Do the premiums for calls cost a lot?

Also, is it call options that people can get into huge debt with somehow?; Aren’t we oversupplied with lithium?; The question is how long we have to hold them.  My tolerance is just a few years.  Is the next administration going to spend money into?    I invested because that what Biden promised more than 4 years ago.; You can deffo bet on a turn around.  My bet was on Chinese developers' stocks that no one would touch and made massive gains.

But you would want to bet on a turn around near the time it will turn around.  Considering the oversupply is expected to last for a few years, look at the situation again next year.

Personally, I am keeping an eye out on the solar industry.  Oversupply and waiting for a turn around.; Thanks! IMO, like a lot of things it's somewhere in-between. You don't want to be ARKK and pile into anything remotely viewed as ""disruptive"" and look great during a bubble for a couple of years but then get obliterated and over 5 years you'd be better off owning Walmart. 

And it's not necessarily no, either. It's looking at a lot of names in the sector and if most of them have been obliterated in recent years, 1) a lot of them went public during a bubble where low quality growth went public via IPO or SPAC at high valuations (and it became evident that many SPACs delivered nowhere near their initial presentations/goals.), 2) does a name have high quality management - if they offered estimates when they went public via SPAC, how far off have they been? Is there a path to profitability? Is there a moat? People can do well for periods if there's short squeezes in these sorts of things, but looking through the battery stock rubble is there something that's actually built to last? 

If there is, what's an appropriate position size where you're satisfied with the risk and can see the bet through inevitable volatility? Or, perhaps batteries are just not a great business aside from something is a hot name for a while.

I have a basket of early stage names and a few scattered turnaround names. They are very, very small holdings  and a good deal of times those names graduate to larger holdings and sometimes they don't and are dumped.  

So, it's not ""no"" to growth themes like this but it's not being ARK (""He argued that Ark prioritizes chasing “future ideas” without proper evaluation of traction, valuation, and management credibility"", https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/05/38915172/investment-advisor-says-throwing-random-darts-at-tickers-would-beat-arkk-as-cathie-) either. Somewhere in-between there's a reasonable exploration of various growth themes of the day, trying to determine whether it's a good business/there's a good business within the theme that seems built to last - sometimes there isn't - and position sizing appropriately.; This comment is so arrogant.

Dangerous? yeah, sure, drama queen..; Water for lithium mining is only a problem in places that already have a water problem.; The answer is no. Too much competition and there is no real advantage for any company. Also high cyclical so very volatile; I mean I’m down 70%, I’m willing to go down with the ship tbh. Didn’t put too much in. My general rule of thumb is no gain no sell, with my small investments; I went with $100; Depends on the stock price and delta.  No debt. The cost of the option is the only thing you can lose. So if you pay $500 for the option, your max loss is $500.; There’s an argument for that.  But you could say that about many things from corn chips to computer chips.  But the key is that the right ones, in the right place, and the right time, those will have value.  

That’s why I’ve liked LAC.  They have the approvals, the domestic deposits, centrally located near customers.  

If there is indeed an abundance, then it becomes a commodity pricing thing.  And that will mean LAC has the product close to the end market, low shipping costs, good volume, rich reserves.  All that  makes LAC competitive.; Was there ever a time a president promised to invest into an industry during et their term and that industry ended up booming? Serious question

Maybe I’m stupid, but I tend to steer away from politicians and just look at the individual businesses because in my eyes, if you read what a politician has said, or don’t, you’re throwing a dart into the dark either way 🤣; Ok you started talking too smart for me here with these acronyms, but I tried to make as much sense out of what you said anyhow 😭

So basically, the majority of battery stocks are shit, but like any other industry, there’s going to be a couple that prevail. Look into the fundamentals of each business including their management team etc. and ensure they actually know what they are doing and not some ex Wendy’s managers flipping more middle fingers than burgers to customers

When looking for something that is built to last, I’m assuming you’re looking to see what businesses are consistently reinvesting their retained earnings into future operations rather than taking it out as dividends to directors etc; Oh, right. Thanks. Seems like common sense in hindsight, sorry!; If there is so much competition would you then consider the industry itself to be healthy and hence investing in some type of ETF (if there is one) on lithium stocks a good buy then?; Yikes, have you ever thought about cutting your losses on small investments at 10% say? You can still watch the stock and get back involved when you see an uptrend forming. Even if youre not trading this rule of thumb works well when buying stocks that can go down 70-90%. If you can avoid 70% losses would you?; Yeah. Sorry for the nooby question. Looked into it a bit in the meantime and found out a decent amount about it. Cheers.; No! More competition means thinner margins and lesser profits.; That would be the smart route, and I am not about that route. I’m tryna maximise my adrenaline while maximising my potential for profits and actively minimising my actual profits 🙌

In all seriousness though, I should definitely reconsider that type of approach when investing. 

Since it was like £60, I didn’t really take it seriously and just saw the price was very low since launch, couldn’t find reasoning online for it being low other than the FS being bad, so just chucked it in hoping for a long term revival. 

I really do appreciate your input though mate 🤣 I’m going to have a look at different risk management methods tonight; Nothing to be sorry about. I was a noob once too. Let me know if you have anymore questions"
"I reviewed a few of my mutual funds, I was very surprised what I found. ","I was going through my Fidelity holdings for mutual funds, and after the third I was looking at I realized that they all owned the same stocks. Apple, Google, Meta and Microsoft were the top holdings in basically all them.

Growth Discovery? Check.

Capital and Income? Check.

Total Market Index? Check.

These three 'diversified' funds were in fact not very diversified at all.

Not sure if I liquidate the growth discovery and capital/income funds and just pile the procedes into the index fund.

I also have small cap index, medium cap index and an international index, but those above three funds are close to 40 percent of my Fidelity portfolio.

The point I am making with this post however, is if you too think you are 'diversified' in your funds like I did with mine, you might want to check again and make sure you really are.

  
\[edit\] Thanks to /u/[brewgeoff](https://www.reddit.com/user/brewgeoff/) for pointing out that a) I'm an idiot, and b) that the capital and income fund is a BOND fund, not a Stock fund. Blech.

Also, growth discovery is a large cap growth fund so tech companies are exactly what it should contain.

Also, those funds are diversified because they are diversified internally. That moniker does not apply to a fund that is diversified FROM whatever you happen to hold.; That’s why just holding one total market index makes more sense than trying to slice and dice.; I buffer my concentration of ""mag 7"" overweight tendencies by adding s&p 500 equal weighted etf RSP.; My 401K plan offered three index funds for Large Cap: Dodge & Cox, J.P Morgan, and Vanguard. I was investing in all of them for the last few years.

Each of them were different, but had a lot of the same companies. I recently closed out of the other two and went all in on Vanguard, which was the only true S&P 500 fund of the lot. Plus, it had the lowest fees by far.; Morningstar.com's subscription service tools will aggregate all your funds, stocks, etc. together so you can see one view and how much Apple you own across all funds, etc. as it breaks out every stock held across all funds in a portfolio (as well as analyzing the entire portfolio for %stocks, %bonds, %cash, etc.).  I own no outright shares of Apple or Microsoft yet, I discovered, I own a lot of Apple and Microsoft.; The mostly frequently mentioned S&P 500 by Vanguard momentum is controlled by the 7 tech stocks(aka magnificent 7). Rest 504-7 stocks carries 15% momentum.

I may ccaution it is *fund ticker $ x % weig*ht that matters.  For example, if PLTR comprises .005% of the S&P500. It has a less weight than AAPL which has a mkt cap of $231x 0.075%(weight) total than $41.93 x 0.005% etc.; Is this in a taxable brokerage account, or some tax-advantaged retirement account?; hooly shit, you are right. I can't believe i brainfarted like that. Good thing its after hours. :D Still, the C&I has .97% expense ratio, I might want to dump it anyways and find something else.; It's an inherited IRA I received from my mom when she died in 2014. I have to take minimum distributions every year which are taxable, but the transactions inside the IRA are not subject to capital gains. I can (and have been) performing actions that normally would take a pretty big tax bite but are shielded inside the IRA. So moving the funds around to re-balance is not going to be an issue.

I also have standard accounts that are taxable. One of them I've just sold some shares of a mutual fund for a planned expense in the next few months. I 'oversold' the fund and put 25 percent of the proceeds into t-bills (4.3 percent) that I'll use to pay the tax come April, might as well make some interest on that too while I wait.; r/investing be like ""Why would I pay an advisor 1%"" and then own shit with expense ratios of .97%; I personally would just sell this stuff and get total market funds like VTI and VXUS and build a 3 fund portfolio"
"""frontier tech"" portfolio ","hey all, sharing what i'm calling my ""frontier tech"" portfolio, broken down by percentages. i'm looking for valuable input, feedback, and discussion around it. and, if it happens to be helpful to anyone, even better. i do want to clarify a few things:

* i'm focused on AI, bitcoin, and space. investment vehicles or not, i simply think each are tech frontiers that hold tons of promise, are poised for massive growth, and will bring immense amounts of value to the world over the next few decades. let's just call this a ""frontier tech"" portfolio, to give it a name i can reference.
* i'm not looking for feedback that just disagrees with that thesis. whether you think AI is all hype, or you are anti-Bitcoin and think it's a ponzi scheme, or you think space is a waste of resources, or anything along these lines - that's ok, i respect that perspective, but i'd like to avoid arguing about it. we just disagree about some fundamental things, and you won't convince me i'm simply wrong.
* i AM looking for feedback on blind spots, poor/missing assumptions, overconfidence, things i'm not considering, or any other constructive input that falls within the framework of the overall thesis. i'm not just looking for people to agree with me (though that is interesting input as well) - i just want feedback that can be applied within my overall investing philosophy.
* yes, i'm missing some key areas of what many would call ""frontier tech"" - biotech, green / nuclear energy, cybersecurity, to name a few - but i just don't have the same level of confidence in specific areas of those. i prefer to stay relatively focused on the categories where i'm most confident and able to stay up to date.
* i'm trying to keep my language somewhat appealing to a wide audience. not looking to get too bogged down in technical details or language that would alienate someone reading this stuff who's less familiar with one or any of the spaces/categories.
* my primary goal is a portfolio of funds and stocks that i can invest in with *strong long-term confidence in growth.* not stuff i trade frequently. and not stuff i love the idea of or that seems interesting / sexy but that i don't know enough about (SMCI, PLTR, altcoins as some good examples). i also generally prefer companies whose leadership i trust and/or admire.

ok, with that out of the way, let's dive in:

**30% AI** - 10% NVDA, 5% SOXQ, 15% balanced mixed of NOW, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, META, AMZN

* HIGH LEVEL: to me, this category is ABSOLUTELY going to change our world in fundamental ways over the next several decades. AI's potential is not chatGPT, or smarter versions of it. it's far beyond what we're seeing from LLMs today. if you listen to the engineers and operational leaders within the AI space, listen to not what they ""believe"" is gonna happen, but to what they know is coming because they've already used the tech, usually 1-2 years before the public even sees it, these people are overwhelmed, amazed, terrified, enchanted, bewildered. to me, that's just very interesting. i believe what some others do - that we're in the midst or on the verge of another technological revolution. i'm not bothered much that AI isn't monetizing in demonstrable, repeatable ways. i think there's been and continues to be enough fundamental, increasing advancement in this field that the value creation will absolutely surpass what most people think. as for the individual stocks, i'll do a quick dive here. to be clear, I don't think these are groundbreaking choices and many are very obvious. but, seems useful to give my favorite things about each:
* 10% NVDA - these guys are and will continue to be at the center of the whole thing. their moat is extensive. it's not just GPU / blackwell demand. it's their CUDA programming language and universe, and stickiness of it. it's the long-term horizon required for their data centers that makes 5-10 year customers out of everyone who buys their stuff. it's CEO jensen pushing them and already looking for the ""next big thing."" just a lot of confidence here.
* 5% SOXQ - i like this semiconductor ETF a little more than SMH because it's more diverse (SMH is like 25% NVDA, which is great if i didn't already allocate so much there), and it's got a low expense ratio (0.19%). i love this exposure because the AI industry is driven by these companies (e.g. TSMC, Micron, Broadcam, Qualcomm, AMD, AMAT).
* 15% mix of these...
   * NOW - excellent leadership and integrated heavily with NVDA tech; will benefit hugely from AI boom with AI-driven automation
   * META - founder-run and with a clear vision; demonstrating enormous resources and focus on building AI models, meeting consumer needs, being pioneers in tech at large
   * AAPL - will probably benefit the most from consumer-facing AI products and implementation; strong leadership
   * AMZN - AWS is a profit monster that will be huge for AI tools and services and data centers; logistics and ecom will be big AI beneficiaries; strong leadership
   * MSFT - deeply embedded in the AI revolution with its investment in OpenAI + AI integration into Azure and Microsoft 365; excellent leadership
   * GOOGL - AI pioneer with DeepMind / Brain; they still own search; have enormous amount of data; questionable leadership but I'm holding for now
* No TSLA??? no. i just don't trust elon musk enough at this point. and i need confidence in a company's leadership for me to invest in its stock. there's a big chance i'm missing out (their robotics division might be incredible), but I'm able to sleep OK with that.
* i'm also missing plenty of other AI picks. i know that. these are the ones i can invest in with the most confidence.

**30% Bitcoin** - 25% Bitcoin itself (cold storage or an ETF), 5% MSTR

* HIGH LEVEL: why Bitcoin? books have been written about it, but to shortly summarize my perspective - it's quite volatile and risky short-term, and quite growth-oriented and (thus far) safe long-term. excellent store of value. wonderful technology, math/code based, and may or may not upend some portion of the financial system. limited supply that's only decreasing over time. immutable. now adopted by many big institutions. goes on giant bull runs every 4 or so years. some days, it's hard to justify NOT putting more into this one, but for now i'm convinced that  diversification is the better long-term play.
* 20% Bitcoin - many would argue that holding actual Bitcoin, ideally off exchanges and on cold storage is the smartest play here. but there are also arguments for FBTC or IBIT (helpful in tax-advantaged accounts; trusting an ETF seems safer to some - very debatable). i do some cold storage, and some FBTC (they self-custody their Bitcoin, which not everyone does). either way, just Bitcoin. it's the only crypto play where my confidence level is very high.
* 5% MSTR - this is a leveraged Bitcoin play. strong chance it outpaces BTC growth rate during bull runs. i may shift some MSTR profits to Bitcoin over time if it starts to really offset my 4:1 BTC:MSTR ratio.

**30% Space** - 10% ASTS, 10% RKLB, 5% LUNR

* HIGH LEVEL: the tech for space finally seems to match the potential that's been talked about for decades and decades. for a while, space-x really proved this out, almost single-handedly. but we clearly have some strong other players either in or entering the category. my favorites are these three. here's why:
* 10% ASTS - you should read the kook report (google it) for a true deep dive, but to hit my high level points: they are pre-revenue but with the potential for MASSIVE growth. effectively, their satellite system aims to offer a global cellular network. think starlink but more b2b and generally better tech. they own tons of patents. they are 5+ years ahead of what many think will be a winner-takes-most race. their partners already include AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Bell Canada, and more. they have excellent leadership. i find this a risky-ish play as they have tons to still accomplish, but the potential growth is enormous.
* 10% RKLB - effectively, a space-x competitor on smaller rockets, with a fraction of the market cap and a huge runway for growth. i think still heavily undervalued today. nerdy/awesome leadership. vertically integrated. as telecom, defense, and general research spending expands to space economy, RKLB is positioned very, very well.
* 5% LUNR - i've spent less time researching them than the other two, but my confidence level in the risk/reward is still pretty high. key player in the lunar economy - one of few companies that can deliver payloads to the moon. very niche but valuable moat. huge potential, good amount of risks ahead.

**10% cash** - ...to buy them juicy dips.

ok, that's my ""frontier tech"" portfolio summary. to repeat - this is what i can confidently invest in for what i believe will be better-than-average returns over the next 10+ years. i recognize that this discussion didn't even really touch share price, EPS, P/E, profitability, revenue, or other key details. this just isn't the place where i'm getting into that. i can say that i'm comfortable with the financial metrics and details regarding these companies. but this discussion is mainly focused on what categories i think are poised for the most growth, and what companies/stocks/assets in those categories seem to be most positioned to lead that growth. thanks for reading.

Nvidia closes at record as AI chipmaker's market cap tops $3.4 trillion,"Nvidia shares closed at a record on Monday as Wall Street gears up for earnings season and updates from all of the chipmaker’s top customers on their planned spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure.

The stock climbed 2.4% to close at $138.07, topping its prior high of $135.58 on June 18. The shares are now up almost 180% for the year and have soared more than nine-fold since the beginning of 2023.

Nvidia, widely viewed as the company selling the picks and shovels for the AI gold rush, has been the biggest beneficiary of the generative AI boom, which started with the public release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November 2022. Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) are used to create and deploy advanced AI models that power ChatGPT and similar applications.

Companies including Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon are purchasing Nvidia GPUs in large quantities to build increasingly large clusters of computers for their advanced AI work. Those companies are all slated to report quarterly results by the end of October.

Of the billions of dollars the top tech companies are spending annually on their AI buildouts, an outsized amount is going to Nvidia, which controls about 95% of the market for AI training and inference chips, according to analysts at Mizuho.

Nvidia’s revenue has more than doubled in each of the past five quarters, and at least tripled in three of those periods. Growth is expected to modestly slow the rest of the year, with analysts projecting expansion of about 82% to $32.9 billion in the quarter ending in October, according to LSEG.

Nvidia recently said that demand for its next-generation AI GPU called Blackwell is “insane” and it expects billions of dollars in revenue from the new product in the fourth quarter.

With a market cap of $3.4 trillion, Nvidia is the second most valuable publicly traded U.S. company, behind Apple at about $3.55 trillion.

It most likely will just hold there.; Get ready for that sell off if these articles are out; All of Tesla flowing into NVDA cause they saw the Optimus shit show; I'm confused weren't they at like 700$ a share months ago? Did something happen? Am I tripping?; 140.75 is NVDA’s ATH OP.; It’s 52 week high is 146? How is this not blatant manipulation; It was not an all time high; Total noob here. How is market cap calculated? Is it amount of shares multiplied by the current share price? Because i don’t feel that should be the market cap. It should be what has been paid for each share so if you have for example:

4 shares total
Share holder 1 paid $5
Share holder 2 paid $6
Share holder 3 paid $9
Share holder 4 paid $1 initially but sold it for $10 to a new shareholder.

The market cap after the sell went by the normal standards from 9 times 4 to 10 times 4. (From $36 to $40)

But in my view it should be the amount paid per share summed up which would be a market cap of $21 initially before the sell to $30 after the sell. Which is a big increase due to the sale but still lower than the standard way of describing market cap.

Is this metric in the way i counted recorded in stocks or is it not available. And would that be considered the true market cap or am i just wrong?

The reason i ask this is because i see these hitpieces very often about “a market cap has been reached of x trillion dollars” but if every shareholder would sell at a moments notice not everyone would get the current price on the market so the average price per share is much lower in a mass sell off than the current going price on the market.

If they announced trillions of dollars in revenue their current market cap would be miniscule compared to what it should be.

If market is bearish it will go down, if not it will go up, doesn't matter the actual earnings. Almost guaranteed.; These people are whining about valuations and have no clue what's actually going on lol. NVDA now is like AAPL at the dawn of the iPhone era, it's a complete platform shift and it isn't going to end quickly.; On the other hand market cap of $3.2 trillion is more than the US government spends in a year. Think of that all of the aircraft carriers, F35, roads, social security payment, all of that shit.

Smaller size, more energy efficient, easier to produce. Mostly in mobile devices, but Apple is making arm based laptops. Intel might come back for a little while. X86 still might be used for servers and such. But in the future everything will be either small or preposterously big like quantum computing. Polarisation works in products too. 

AMD is ok.  But if NVDA fails, they will too. So why not the bigger guy? You think they have more growth potential?; I keep hearing this word “priced in” every time NVDA comes ups son it’s such a lazy way to think about this company smh. This community has been repeating that since last May 2023.; So what wasn't priced in to cause it to hit ATH?; Well. It doesn't matter in the long run. Which company's products out of magnificent 7 do I see myself using in 20-30 years?  I know dotcom bubble companies still exist today, but not all of them are good. So who's gonna be there in the future? 

I am not sure Instagram will be there, as well as Facebook. I don't want smart glasses. CEO still young, so there's less conservative control and new tech can be explored. 

I know Microsoft is going full on AI spy with their windows. So probably I will use Mac. 

Apple phones are competitive, but OS is the only thing I am interested in rn. Very impressive customer loyalty. 

Tesla is hot garbage. Leaking, rusting, and potentially chopping people's fingers. Remotely controlled robots sold as autonomous? Marketing catastrophe. They might be around, but I am surely not putting my money into these products. Design wise all their products are bad. Hyperloop is worse than subway. Neuralink is too invasive for every day consumer. Non invasive brain scanners with AI assistance are far superior in terms of consumer adoption, input accuracy can be improved on, but Neuralink accuracy achieved through invasiveness is a dead end medical technology. Just like Hyperloop. CEO is making bad decisions on all fronts except aerospace and it's a small industry.  

Google, outside of YouTube is replaceable by other competitors. Apple in particular. I am using Google just because I like it's open mindset. They are the only company holding market from being taken over by apple. 

Nvidia sells computing power for the next industrial revolution. Drones assisted by AI used in warfare already changed the landscape of war today. We will see robots, even remotely controlled ones, but mostly autonomous due to security in nursing homes, production lines, warehouses, battlefields, home assistance, etc.
Robotics and AI will be future proof technology. 

Right now NVDA is the ONLY  company that has robot training simulations (powered by GPUs), is selling GPUs to other companies that will be competing in the field. Has a truly open AI model that can be modified and is integrated with hardware. Has funds to run it on an open licence long enough that people will trust them in the long haul to learn and become long term clients and users. Many AI companies will use NVDA AI just because it was all they were exposed to when they were starting out in their mother's basement. It is an ecosystem of its own. 

And their biggest competition in the GPU market is literally their cousin. 

Just because they are one of the biggest companies now doesn't mean there's no room for growth. 

Intel guy put his entire Nana's inheritance into a dying company with a praying CEO that produces x86 tech that is already being surpassed by ARM in user's numbers since everyone is using mobile devices, and apple is using ARM CPUs more and more. 

Microsoft is still traded to this day. 

So NVDA is ok to buy. Yeah there might be dips and depressions. But will they be in the future? Most likely yes; that's because Jensen came on CNBC and said ""demand is through the roof"". We'll see this earnings season if that ""demand"" manifest through the earnings number.; I'm constantly wishing I bought Apple or Microsoft back in 2004, 20 years ago. What I didn't know is how many people would have been telling me to sell it the whole time 😅

I bought Nvidia shares because I don't want to miss out again...not on the post-covid run-up, that's a blip. I don't want to miss the opportunity to buy a major player this early. yes, it might be 1997 in terms of AI bubble, but I'm betting Nvidia will look pretty damn good in 2044 compared to today; Why would you say that? It absolutely crushes earnings every quarter, what reason would it have to go down so far? If the earnings grow stalls it will go down, but it hasn't yet. You people act like it is vaporware like Tesla, but nvda is printing money right now.

Edit: instead of just downvoting maybe just tell me why nvidia should be going down?; Taiwan invasion by China might; Those guys are experts in Silicon Valley businesses/startups. I’d recommend it too.; I see Jensen a bit similar to how I see Musk in that yes he is a hype man, but he also delivers and has a strong vision of the future. He knows how to bring together the best talent and get them to execute on that vision. I think these kind of entrepreneurs confuse people because simplistic binary thinking that is popular, ie: someone is either a hype man OR an innovator.

The big idea gained from this interview is that NVidia is WAY more than “just a chip”, and silly notions of them easily being dethroned by a better chip is nonsense. Also that the new unit of compute is the data center, and clusters will be built in node counts of 200-500k in the near future.

Jensen praises Musk for standing up a 100K H100 data center in a matter of a few weeks. Basically building the world’s most powerful supercomputer in record time, which is only possible because of what NVidia has built over the last decade and a half.; You seem knowledgeable.

I’m long on AI but the only reason nvidia is making money is because of companies that are burning money to train and run their llms that aren’t providing them much value yet. It’s too controversial to stay as the most valuable company in the world for two more months. ; Ohhh ok thank you for the reply! I was wondering what the hell was going on 😅 I'm a stock noob as you can tell; Oh i wouldn’t want to redefine it. i was just wondering if what i’m talking about has a different name. And also it’s just that the way they bring it up in articles or comments here on reddit as if the maximum market cap has been reached it would imply there isn’t any more money to afford a higher price. But there obviously is if its about one share. The buyer is not buying all shares just a fraction at a figurative price point.; I’m not a native english speaker so i may have put that down wrong. I would never imply a common term in the financial world is wrong or want to redefine the stock market. Its more about the way this term is becoming a buzzword to show a high price just for the sake of showing a high price more than actually telling something about the value of the company in post like this on reddit or news articles.; So if a company just starts out and all of its million shares go for a dollar. Its a million dollar company but because someone sold one share for $10 it is now worth ten times more and it would be over valued. A hit piece about a super high market cap feels meaningless to me if 1 share can move it up to crazy heights. And for me then the past price do account for the present as that could mean the company is overvalued for example.

Anyways i thank everyone that come out and made an effort to reply and give their insights. It might have been the wrong place to ask looking at the downvotes but it was just a thought that came up and wanted to discuss it.; Please buy Britain; It is.

I probably wont sell my stocks till I need the money during retirement.; Nobody is expecting 100%+ revenue growth to be the norm. But, it would be unwise to think this company won’t grow earnings well beyond the 6%-7% market average. It will continue to climb in the long run. As technology develops you need newly designed chips, and NVDA will continue to benefit.

Eventually however, NVDA will mature like all big tech, for example Apple used to be a high flyer until it’s started to mature more recently. But you would be a fool to sell while it was still in its growth phase.

Semiconductors are notoriously cyclical, so you will see down years, but overall market valuation is arbitrary. At one point $100b was the crazy number, then $500b, then $1 trillion, eventually $10 trillion will be where big tech stands 10-15 years from now. If the earnings are justified, the market valuation will rise accordingly.; I’ve been hearing this for two years; the market can stay irrational for looooooong periods of time; No one knows what  ""ballistic"" hypothetical is.

Don’t think it will end well.; Yeah I'm hanging in there. Kinda sad that I dropped more money into it right before the drop though, couldve been so much cheaper.; > ""So if a company just starts out and all of its million shares go for a dollar. Its a million dollar company but because someone sold one share for $10""

On any reasonable exchange this is a lot more nuanced than your hypothetical is considering. If the ask $10 and the bid is $1, someone (usually, this will be a ""market maker"") will start to close that gap. If someone comes along with a limit order for $10, it will get filled at a lower price. In reality, on an exchange with reasonable volume the ask would never be 10x the bid, because the exchange would have already halted trading. (There are ""OTC"" trades that might occasionally have such a spread, avoid that)

Additionally, even if this situation somehow happened, the next share is going to be sold somewhere in the ""real"" bid/ask spread (closer to $1 in your hypothetical, and the market cap would only blip.

> ""now worth ten times more and it would be over valued""

This goes both ways. If someone were to walk in and try to buy NVDA at a valuation of $3.4 Trillion today, they'd not be able to. By buying up 50% + 1 shares or even a smaller amount, the price would rise, so the original market cap would ""under value"" the company. (That's why actual offers to buy companies on the public market pretty much always come in above the current share price)

It's important to remember, market cap is only the ""best"" metric for a companies actual value in a given moment. Nobody knows the actual value, hell, there is no actual value. That's like asking the price of a painting up for auction before the auction starts. A very important purpose of markets is to help find agreed upon values

Apple is fine because there are no other competitors in the OS market. When windows shoots itself with AI screen saving your monitor feature, there aren't many options left. Linus which have a reputation of being a nerdy platform, or Mac OS. There will be less people that choose Windows. Also I believe in ARM being superior CPU architecture in the future. 

Microsoft has bad features, but it has OpenAI. But who knows what kind of product they make.  Selling AI picked ads? New tech researched by AI? They need consumers to sell their products. And to control their AI without going rogue. It's tough to decide whether they will crash and burn. Or make super products 

Robotics and AI have a future. They may be adopted by mag 7. But windows is doing it all wrong. Meta has glasses that are capable of spying on people and using AI to know information about them in real time. I think it's bad overall. But it has an adoption perspective in security personnel, border control, etc. Stock is at ATH.; except the last earnings was the first one where megacap tech companies were punished for continuously buying NVDA chips. In all the previous earnings they were actually rewarded for it. And the previous one was when they all got punished hard because margins started coming under pressure. And we can see ever since the NVDA earnings, Jensen had been trying hard to make as many public appearances to get in ""demand has been good"", in Goldman Sach tech conference, CNBC, even surprise CNBC appearance.

We can see that when Nasdaq dropped -17% when SP500 only dropped -10%. In all previous corrections after 2022, nasdaq only dropped the same or even less than sp500.; exactly! if you bought Cisco in 1997, you'd have done 10x in 20 years

not too bad if you ask me; But your only argument was # of customers; Your comment was priced in. My comment was priced in. Everything is priced in.; yes. The price? in!; They’re also overextrapolating the growth in AI with the growth of NVIDIA. There will be a massive decoupling. Curious if it will cause a correction or just a shift in allocation to other big tech/semiconductors picks; Yup.  I was assigned on a 141 put I sold in June.  Only good thing is the premium I collected going into the assignment was nice.  Just need to ride the volitility for another month or so.   🍻; Can confirm, am from UK, do not own any NVDA.; Not today though; RemindMe! 1 year; [removed]; GPUs being important is a recent phenomenon. Before this, it was just for gaming.; Cisco is a shitty comparable it was much more expensive in terms of margin and PE and growth, and Cisco achieved revenue size through mergers while Nvidia is almost entirely organic growth; Cisco had a 472 pe in 1999; Cisco was easy to compete with, NVDA not so much.

Unless some new company makes NVDA’s tech obsolete, I wouldn’t compare the two.; Because Intel didn't tank their own share price by 50% since March... kk; Next time use /s; Idk man I think so. Underperforming $qqq $spy lately. I get that it's nowhere near nvda in terms of revenue or their share of the data center market but one is up 170% others only 8%. I'm not buying it though $qqq feels safer; Which is why the retail knuckleheads making those comments in these subs are really funny.; You're right all stocks are kind of overpriced at tje moment. Microsoft was under my watch since they're not doing as good as other top stocks but there's a reason for that. You said they have openai but openai won't be having any profits for a few more years which will actually cost microsoft money in the short term. I love $aapl as well but seems overpriced currently. If I had to pick one, I'd go with meta but tbh it's better to just wait for a pullback to enter long term.; The next decade? Priced in. Next century? Priced in. The whole millennium is priced in.

|-|-|-|-|; RemindMe! 1 year; My brother in Christ you got the bot to remind you in a year? Lmfao I’ll personally remind you in a few months 😂; This is a new all time high with respect to the _closing price_. Thats what hedge fund analysts care about.; Ok, but gaming was/is huge in itself, it's a bigger industry than the movie industry and the music industry... combined... multiplied by 2.5; That's called opportunity 😂; That's a good idea; they are over 10 PS, with mediocre growth, and ugly profit numbers. 

I know a lot of the EPS issue is some accounting BS with the xlinix thing, but the growth and revenue numbers (and prior profit margins) dont justify anywhere near this number imo.; Why is it funny? It's essentially admitting that we don't have any info advantage compared to them. Anything we know would be priced in by them and every bit of info advantage they have over retail knuckleheads as well.

Retail can only basically gamble or keep everything in index funds.; Yeah. Microsoft is making big investment in the data centers. What is going to be inside? Most likely Nvidia GPUs  
The biggest automation will come from AI companies. There may be a lot of them. They all need hardware to train models. Who's making hardware?
China is the only threat to Nvidia since it is a Taiwanese company. Tsmc will soon open in the US , so that will eliminate the risk. 

My  bet is on  automation in general. Companies are greedy. They want to replace us. Might as well cash out on their desire to automate.; So you went all in on NVDA? Otherwise so did you. Realistically the difference in portfolio weight between me and you is not that material. My portfolio is up 35% in the past year, and I'm very happy about that, especially since I never held bubble assets to achieve that. You really should just do a remind me in 1 year and shit on me then. Price is $134 right now; Gaming is huge, I’m not surprised that it is bigger than movies and music combined. Mobile games really changed everything within the industry and advertising/micro transactions became viable. Not to mention the subscription revenue they have started to generate. 

But, Nvidia selling GPU’s to gamers accounted for $3b in 2009 to $6b in 2016 (7 years and $3b in revenue growth). It was a great company and a good stock, but it wasn’t the same giant it is today at $96b (8 years and $90b in revenue growth), that rapid growth was driven by GPUs becoming more important than for just gaming.; “That’s a good idea /s”; No, it isn't admitting anything, it's the opposite. It's the pretense they do know something. An admission you don't know something sounds like ""I don't know something"" not a regurgitation of an at best barely useful explanation.; Retail expect that they can profit against whales who have the huge infra of algorithm and tons of other stuff while the retailer works on a simple laptop.; Sure, my point is just that it is a mature company already.; Usually the question is ""why did a stock fall after great earnings?"" - usually the answer is that it was expected to do even greater and that market had priced in the great earnings. It is literally the truth and more truthful than ""I don't know"" to a question why did stock move the way it did. If you say ""I don't know"" that's untruthful since it's indicating that there aren't those obvious circumstances behind the market.; Well they can't, and by saying that everything is priced in, they admit it.; ""Literally the truth"" usually means ""we have no other explanation"" and ""that must be it"" in a vicious bout of circular reasoning. It's also beyond ironic to talk about inflated expectations you only found out about after the fact.; Your point still holds. There is only and only index funds held long term to make money for retail. Honest retailers of course."
Am I crazy by investing every penny of mine in real estate and bitcoin?,"Premises:

1. I live in an Asia country at potential risk of war.

2. In the past few decades, the real estate here has performed comparably well, even against total stock market. Also, I need a place to live.

My reasoning:

There is an unsustainable government debt crisis.

The 35 trillion government debt is unsolvable, because the solutions are limited and none are likely to work.

Raising taxes will not work, because voters will not let that happen.

Tapering deficit spending will not work, because there are wars going on, regular budgets that have been depending on deficit spending for decades, and bond yields to pay.

Printing money will not work because we are now fighting inflation.

Issuing new bonds to pay the old bonds will not work, because this is paying off the current debts with larger future debts, just postponing the crisis until after the next election, but this is most likely what would happen.

No matter how the crisis unfolds, M2 money supply will increase.

Real estate is physical property that stores value despite increase in money supply.

The decentralized nature of bitcoin appears increasingly appealing in such situations (where bonds may be failing) as well.

The value of self-custody (the way how bitcoin and other crypto are being kept) is also feeling quite real in my shoes. If I ever become refugee of war, my properties are portable by carrying the crypto wallets in my phone and seed phrases on a sheet of paper.

Both properties are safe if the banks fail, either because of a crisis or a war.

So, I just need someone to tell me that I am not crazy, or am I?

Hope you won’t bash me too harshly 😜",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1g3j67d/am_i_crazy_by_investing_every_penny_of_mine_in/,0,">Am I crazy by investing every penny of mine in real estate and bitcoin?

Yes; Diversify. Even if you make good choices, which I’m not saying these are, there’s a reason the phrase don’t put all your eggs in one basket is older than anyone using Reddit.; yes; Every penny into anything is dumb. Diversification my man

But no you aren’t crazy for investing in real estate. And yes you are probably crazy for investing in Bitcoin.; Yes.

Your thoughts on this topic reek of ignorance and general noobery. Learn how investing works instead of using your personal anecdotal evidence to justify emotional ""plays"".; If you're genuinely worried there will be a war in the country and you'll be forced to become a refugee, investing in property makes no sense at all. 

Bitcoin seems to track the nasdaq if anything and if the US defaults on its debt, the value of your bitcoin will be the least of your worries. 

I would suggest all your efforts should be dedicated to getting a visa to a more stable country first and foremost. Whether that would be into skills and education or saving up the minimum amount you need in your bank account to be granted a work visa to your chosen country.; No these are your 2 best bets given your situation. I would do the same if I were in your position; [deleted]; Not at all. In fact I would put the Lambo order in ASAP.; Solid troll here; Yes, you are crazy; No. BTC is a global currency at this point. Just because some people don’t believe in it, doesn’t make it worthless. 

You have Blackrock, Woods, Fidelity, and Saylor to name a few who are constantly buying it. You also have politicians. If all those people, and or funds, thought it was worthless, they wouldn’t be constantly buying it.; Question - when you talk about “investing” in real estate, are you taking about your *primary residence* or other investments property?; At risk of war? So with the first attack when EMP and old fashion artillery will be combined you will loose everything?; You shouldn't be buying RE unless you plan to get actual value from living in it.

Your Bitcoin will make buying RE as an investment obsolete. 

RE denominated in Bitcoin is going down, down, down over long periods of time.; I think you’re crazy for asking /r/investing whether throwing half your net worth into bitcoin is a good idea :); > potential risk of war

  
You just have to invest outside of your country to ”fix” that.  Buy US stuff.  Europe.  Rest of Asia.  Plenty to choose from.; Is there any reason you can't buy investment grade bonds from other countries with stable currencies?
 
If protecting your wealth is your goal and not growth (which comes with risk), it would seem the practical option.; Bitcoin is a scam. So yes you’re foolish.; Really, diversify. 

Bitcoin is a good investment and can rise significantly in a month, as compared to traditional investment options but, just like any crypto, it is risky and volatile.

If you're investing in such a risky asset, you'd rather also invest into something low-risk like government-issued bonds or gold, maybe in a ETF form. You really need a safety net. 

Also, if your country is at the risk of a war... Yeah, perhaps real estate may fall significantly if this risk will become a reality.; Can you please elaborate?; Yes. I will seriously consider it. I should also mention I am a believer of passive indexing for my retirement.; You don't know how old I am; There’s still some sense. The war would be devastating for RE, but it would also wipe away the mortgage debt I am having. And I would still hold bitcoin. I am diversifying, just between different possibilities but not the traditional ways.; Yes it is. You know Asia well.; I do have debt that I would happily see them wiped away in case of a war.; 1 primary residence and an additional one.; Doesn’t hurt to discuss. Isn’t this the point of this sub?; It’s not that I don’t want that. The point is:

1. I would need to invest stocks and bonds through foreign banks. I do have a firstrade online account, but I am not sure if that account would still be effective if my passport is not?

2. There is still the debt problem that I was not comfortable with, at least not as I am comfortable with bitcoin.; I do have an online firstrade account, but is it still accessible outside my country and when my passport is invalid? I don’t know, but there’s no such problem with bitcoin anywhere, as long as I can access crypto exchange.; Yes. Real estate would become worthless during war, so I diversify with bitcoin….; It hinges on the idea that the government cannot meet its debt obligations.

Arguably, the US government is able to service its debt BETTER than it has in the past, because the growth in the economy has exceeded the average interest payment as a percent of the GDP.  The US government is better able to handle its debt load now than it was 30 years ago, despite a larger stock of debt. 

Bitcoin is a speculative asset with no claim to underlying cash flows. It is not a good inflation hedge, unlike stocks and bonds that have inflation expectations baked into the market price of those securities.and the fact that it is so speculative would make it more susceptible to left tail events, like the one you mentioned. 

Real estate isn’t as egregious, but you should be diversified across a variety of different asset classes.; Like you have zero US stock, index, or bond at all?  Do you remember the IMF Asia crisis?  Or the recent Nepal and Sri Lanka dollar crisis? Always put your money into the US if you think there will be an economic crisis or a war since the dollar can 2-10x against local currency overnight in a bad recession since the government needs to repay back its debt in dollar.

But the best part, you can go to any country in the world since US stocks are high liquidity.  Leave your country during a war, and live off from dividends from US stocks or sell your investment to rebuild your life.  

The only thing that matters in this world is the US dollar.  This isn’t a nationalism talk. The US created IMF to control the world economy, and they will nuke any country that tries to overthrow the US dollar.  The current trade war with China is because they have been lending yuan to other countries and cheating with the exchange rate.  Now look at China, they are in a recession for almost a decade.; This sub is very traditional where most things outside of holding index funds are considered bad. Which isn’t a bad thing because of how many beginners are here; So you invest in two high risk assets. Doesn't sound too good, honestly.; The US government being better able to handle debts are sound answers. Thanks! I’ll research into that!; The US government isn't relevant, they are in Asia.; [deleted]; Cannot agree with the comments on bitcoin though. I treat it as digital portable gold. Lots of institutions are accumulating bitcoin like others are accumulating gold. Central banks worldwide accumulate gold, just to name a few. Both gold and bitcoin has industrial usage too. Bitcoin is an efficient medium for cross-border transfer, for example.; Are you assuming the deficits stop now?  The reality is the last few admins have run insane deficits and are likely to continue to.  

I agree that OP should be diversified, my argument is that you shouldn't be so confident that rising US debt is not an issue when the top economists in the world don't agree on it.; I already have had enough of those in the Boglehead subreddits. I am not investing for retirement or children’s college funds just now. Lazy investments is not for ppl who may be forced to pay large expanses in near term or whose housing issues are not yet settled.; Okay. So real estate is high risk asset? It rose 400% over 10 years where I live, and they are still appreciating since I bought them.; While that’s true, they mentioned the US debt load, so that’s what I addressed. Also if the US defaults that has massive global ramifications. Don’t downplay that.; I used to be a huge bitcoin bull, but I’ve changed my mind on it completely.

**Bitcoin cannot be an asset with a high rate of return, and an effective form of money at the same time**

1. Gresham’s Law states that “bad” money chases out the “good” money. Back when we used golden coins, the coin issuers would dilute them with other metals and shave portions of them off. The diluted coins would end up circulating, as people did not want to part ways with the pure gold, unaltered coins. Because of this, the diluted coins ended up becoming the new standard form of money, because that is what everyone was using for every day transactions. If Bitcoiners are truly correct about their persistently high rates of return, than we should expect a similar phenomenon. People would rather transact in dollars which is likely to depreciate relative to goods and services, than Bitcoin which is likely to increase relative to goods and services (according to Bitcoiners at least). 
2. if Bitcoin appreciates relative to goods and services like bitcoiners claim. this would be contractionary to the broader economy. The extent to which real interest rates are uncertain due to bitcoins extreme volatility, lenders will need to raise interest rates even more to compensate for additional uncertainty.
3. Bitcoin is a terrible store of value. I think Bitcoiners greatly mischaracterize what a store of value actually is. I think a good store of value as it relates to currency is defined as something that will “reliably retain its value through time.” Fiat currencies undergo inflation but it is mostly predictable and stable (in developed economies). Bitcoins price in the future is not whatsoever predictable and stable. Perhaps this is more of a semantics argument, and I am reading into their claims too literally. I think they’re conflating “store of value” with “inflation hedging” . For example stocks are solid hedges against expected inflation but no one really calls them a “store of value”. 
4. Asset Backed money is limited. During the great depression when we were on the gold standard, part of what extended it for as long is the fact that banks increase their interest rates to prevent massive outflows of gold. Raising interest rates is the complete opposite of what you want while in an economic downturn. This caused a deflationary spiral. There are substantial benefits to having a monetary authority to step in and influence rates as needed, which cannot easily be done when we are constrained by asset backed money.

**Bitcoin is NOT a good inflation hedge**
1. Stocks and bonds have expectations of inflation baked into the discount rate on future cash flows. This includes expected supply side inflation. Bitcoin has no cash flows for which inflation can be priced. Bitcoiners call it an inflation hedge due to its limited supply, but this alone cannot hedge against supply side inflation. 
2. Bitcoin has never hedged against unexpected inflation ex-post, responding negatively to higher than expected inflation and responding positively to lower than expected inflation. 
3.Maybe Bitcoin can hedge against demand side inflation, but it seems to me there are other inflation hedges out there that can do its job better for far less risk. 

***Bitcoiners also tend to completely misunderstand how the monetary system works.***

The Fed is not printing money you or I spend, they’re printing bank reserves. Bank reserves aren’t lent to us, they are a special kind of money banks use to settle flows in the central clearing house. Banks have not been constrained by bank reserves during the 2008 financial crisis. Following the GFC when the Fed supplied ample reserves to the banking system, the Fed actually STRUGGLED to get inflation at or above the 2% target. This is because bank reserves were no longer the binding constraint to facilitate lending. 

This criticism is reserved mainly for bitcoin. I think other blockchains are more interesting, like Ethereum for example because.

1. Ethereum does not need to function as money. It can function as a sort of lubricant that allows the blockchain to function more smoothly.
2. Ethereum is a prerequisite to interreact with a myriad of tokens and applications built on top of the network as you need it to pay gas fees. Similar to the dollar, which is a de facto prerequisite for interacting with US businesses. This induces demand for Ethereum beyond pure speculation
3. Ethereum actually redistributes some of its fees to token holders through staking, although I know this is causing some complaints from the SEC.; Even gold is not a good inflation hedge. I implore you to look at the data itself. Gold has had 25 year long periods where its cumulative real (inflation adjusted) return was -60%. 

It’s also debatable on whether or not gold has better left tails. There were more year over year drawdowns for gold more than 10% than there were 10% drawdowns of the US equities market from 1972 to present. 

Bitcoin and Gold does have limited industrial uses, but why does this imply that it will have positive real returns? It’s a commodity, whose price is driven only on what someone else is willing to pay for its whereas stocks and bonds are a claim on the productive assets of a corporation, purchased at a discount.; I think this is missing nuance. 

A real estate investor generally has a ton of debt, but they are comfortable with the debt because they know the return on their real estate will likely exceed the monthly payments they have on their mortgage.

With the government it’s similar. If the economy is growing faster than the average interest payments on the debt, than they are fine. They will extract more in the form of tax revenue over time than the debt is costing them. 

This is exactly what has happened since the 80’s and 90’s back when there was a much lower concern about the debt. 

In fairness, the [interest as a percent of GDP](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYOIGDA188S) has increased materially recently, but it is still well within safe levels.; Generally not but you wrote that your country is at risk of being at war yourself. Hope it is far enough from the border, at least.; Quite correct. The local stock market here basically trails the ups and downs of SP500; You are very well educated financially, but you are wrong about the value of blockchain. It is a superior technology that eliminates the intermediary in the banking system, which include QE policy, flaws in credit rating systems, or any possible financial crisis resulting from irresponsible behaviors we see in 2008 subprime mortgage. It is transparent, corruption-resistant, and easily accessible wherever the internet is available. Yes there are lots of scammers and it’s easy to fall for them if you don’t know the technology well, but the industry is advancing everyday and the problems you mentioned is just insignificant. I am surprised that ppl here have not seen this yet, but I am ok if there’s no agreement in this subreddit.; Yes. These are very sound views of gold, stock, and bonds. I ll diversify into stocks and bonds after researching on debt handling make me assured.; And what if US debt doubles again over a 10 year period, or more likely 2 terms with the way it's been accelerating.  

It's cool to look at a snap shot and say it's okay, but like I said, guys much smarter than you and I don't agree on whether this will become a problem and if so, when.; For what it’s worth, I used to be a blockchain Megabull, so I am familiar with all the arguments surrounding blockchain. Like I mentioned, I think Ethereum is actually decent, but I think the idea that it should serve to replace money, or other aspects of the existing financial system, is not a good idea. 

I’m okay with the other arguments you made, but I disagree with this.

“Eliminates intermediary in banking system which includes QE policy, or any possible financial crisis, subprime mortgage 2008”

It seems to me that any attempt to make block chain protocols compete with traditional financial intermediaries is to mimic what the traditional financial system already is doing. 

For example, lending and borrowing smart contracts are looking into creating soul bound tokens so they can determine their credit worthiness, very similar to a credit score. Without this, borrowers are limited to loans that do not exceed the amount deposited. Governance of the protocol is generally governed by who holds the most governance tokens. This is very similar to equity ownership, and large quantities of the tokens are concentrated in only a few holders. This is hardly the decentralized utopia that crypto investors dream of, and TBH I’m unsure completely why we would want to achieve it to begin with. 

I think blockchain tech will degenerate into the very thing it seeks to replace. Blockchain is trending towards mimicking what currently exists but doing it more inefficiently because the settlement layer is decentralized and therefore a lot more inefficient than traditional financial systems.; Respectfully, that is a blatant appeal to authority. I can name several top economists who share the same views as me too. What matters is the substance of the argument. 

There is always a risk the US is fiscally irresponsible in the future, and I’m not trying to make the claim that it’s an impossibility, but I think the risk is low and it’s overblown based on everything I’ve said so far. 

In either case the risk does materialize, the solution would not be Bitcoin. The best way would be to diversify globally.; You are right that the technology is not mature enough to compete with the traditional systems. 

Not yet.

It is processing slow, settling slow, inefficient compared to traditional banks except for international transactions. This is a scalability issue, and it’s clear that near-perfect solutions will be ready within years (solutions that make them decentralized and at the same time as fast as visa) and there’s a clear winner imho. I am not referring to ethereum, but the “input endorser” as “Ouroboros Leios” is, if you are interested.

The value of bitcoin is that it is not hackable to date, and unlikely ever to be hackable. It is not efficient, but it is flawless in the security aspect with few competitors.; Lol.  I am not arguing against your opinion.  I am telling you that while there are economists who share your view, there are also others who disagree.  It all hinges on WHETHER rates stay low and economic growth outpaces interest payments.  I disagree with you taking a snapshot and telling this kid definitively that the debt is not a problem.   And like I said before, I was not making a point about Bitcoin or real estate.  

It's okay to acknowledge and refer to folks who have more formal education on a topic than you.   Im sure it's more fun pretending everything you have learned was your unique idea though; Solutions like L2 scaling or side chains are by no means near perfect. There are several issues.

1. Bridging has notoriously been the biggest vulnerability for L2’s and side chains. It’s also clunky to most average users

2. L2’s are more centralized and less secure. Look into the scalability trilemma. In order to get better scalability you need to give up decentralization and / or security.

3. Lack of interoperability. This is my favorite part of blockchain personally but this goes away or adds a ton of rigidities in a multi chain or L2 centric world.

Bitcoins security comes at the expense of massive amounts of emissions. That might derive some value, but again I don’t see why this translates into persistent positive real returns.; Try and read in between the lines a little bit. OP asked about going ALL IN on real estate and bitcoin to hedge against a debt crisis. This is an extreme reaction for something that is not at risk of happening in the near future. 

My point was not to say that risk of a debt crisis is 0. I challenge you to look for where I said that. Like I said, read in between the lines. The comment was to address an extreme allocation to hedge against an unlikely event. 

I never pretended my view was original. It’s shared by several top economists, Paul Krugman, Janet Yellen, Larry Summers, etc.; 1. Input endorsement has nothing to do with L2 scaling.
2. Yes, there is no positive real return with bitcoin. It is just a superior technology (cash without supply-side inflation and remain valid even when governments are not working or not working well). The bullish trend is the result of this value being unrecognized by most of the world yet, but the need is universal and this is what bitcoin does better. So, as long as there’s a significant portion of people still not recognizing it’s value, I am bullish. If there is another crisis (a financial one or not) and the economy struggles with or without QE, more and more people will turn their sights to bitcoin and see the value in it where some others already did.; Lol okay bud.  Next time i'll read between the lines and you just read my words literally.   I was replying clearly to your comment on US debt and not OP's Bitcoin/real estate stuff. I mentioned that numerous times.  But let's just pretend and move on."

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

I went with UBER as my investment since they have Uber eats and Uber freight. But LYFT up as well.; Anyone else is in this constant lingo of ""I wish this stock I hold would dip so I can buy more"" and 'I wish it would go to the moon"" lol; Not surprised by tsla sell off.. But I think it rallies after a few days; This is too easy, stocks only go up! Feel sorry for those sitting on cash. Roaring 20s!; Funny headline

""PPI data September reflects tame inflation in U.S. economy's guts""; Aehr Test Systems (AEHR) with a solid report and outlook. Growth prospects look promising!; Back into $NXT for me today, I sold out at $55 a while back but risk/reward here looks very juicy to me; SE about to break 100.

Trying to decide is 288 is where I want to sell or if I'd like to ride longer. Originally 315 seemed like a good price target but i wouldnt mind taking some gains; Cybersecurity has been on a run, panw up 10%+ this week; APP breaking 52-week high everyday for the past month. This stock just refuses to go down. Same with PLTR; Aehr +24%, I know a few others here were in it too; New ATH, we are so going to 6k. Bank earnings were quite phenomenal.; Yeah, this is what a bull market feels like.; Here's my thoughts this week and next week

Short-term:

1. HUMA (no position yet) - I am bullish on the technology, just debating whether to buy just stocks or if I should also buy calls. I'm expect price to be at $15/share, so I guess I should be content with a \~2.5x return? Yep, let's not be greedy.

Long-term

1. WBD (no position) - 1 year at the very least before true value is determined  
2. DQ (DCA up) - 1 year at the very least before true value is determined  
3. NEP (DCA down) - 2 years at least before true value is determined, however dividend yield is compensating and won't be cut for the next 2 years.; Will JPM keep rising or drop ?; Im looking at Uber, nice pop today but look at that earnings ratio.  Holy mother of god what is wrong with this picture here?; This movement has been absurd. WHO is still buying mag 7 at these prices?????; >JPMorgan Calls It: The U.S. Economy Has Made a Soft landing The bank’s positive assessment suggests that the Federal Reserve may be on course to deliver the much-anticipated soft landing, as inflation moderates while growth remains intact.


Jpow did it.... Bears are hurttt....; Who is still in $BTU? My profits are nothing to write home about but $27 is pretty good given current energy markets. Seems to have gone straight vertical this month (+30%). Might start trimming... might.

Other than China / Iran / Israel stuff, part of it is possibly Russian coal production tanking. Well, not production so much as the railways not being able to handle deliveries due to deteriorating infrastructure / lack of maintance; Why is avgo -4%?; Happy Friday!; My 2 boring, cheap, truck related stocks continue ripping to new all time highs over and over. $R and $PCAR

I bought some more on the recent dip on PCAR, posted it here and was downvoted to oblivion; alright I started buying SPXU to hedge. love the perma-bul  market, but this kinda of getting hilarious at this point; All green and up 2.30% today. Even my most consistently flat stock is finally putting a little pep in its step. 

Man, Making money is easy B); $TLN down quite a bit off its highs, still up massively YTD but its has my interest piqued gotta dig in more over the weekend; inflation warmer than expected yesterday, PPI warmer than expected today, consumer inflation expectation for 1-year out tick up to 2.9% vs. 2.7% expected, so totally makes sense that the Russell is outperforming...; Started a position in MRK and HUM. PE, RSI, forecast along with a look at their financials suggests they should be able to recover nicely into next year.; For those of you who are bullish about some aspects of TSLA but are tired of Elon or the Car part just continuing to decline, may I introduce you to EOSE.

The fastest growing part of TSLA is the battery storage aspect. EOSE is a pure play battery storage company, using a non Lithion Ion tech. This tech is longer duration, has no fire risk, emits no noise, and can be stacked as densely as you can imagine.

Lots of new catalysts coming up, and has gone from 5.60 in September 2023, down to 0.60 in May 2024 on bankruptcy risks, but recently had a great investment from Cereberus that has caused a massive rally from 0.60 to 3.30. It pulled back this week to 2.79 and is now back at 3.02.

If you want to learn more, check out twitter for $EOSE or even do some research yourself aboput the tech, their backlog, and the financing agreement with Cereberus.

EDIT: thanks for downvoting a legit comment. Guess I should have just posted some comment jerking of JPOW to get upvotes. Clown sub; Still around, /u/CosmicSpiral?; Some due diligence info for $CLOV:

I seem to notice that whenever a stock is down 3+ % at open or shortly after, it always increases at least a little bit throughout the morning. Is this a common trading strategy?; SPY trailing 12 month earnings are still LOWER than they were at the peak in 2021. Yet SPY is almost 25% higher with lower earnings.

Remember that everyone agreed that stocks were overvalued in 2021, yet today people seem to think stocks are fairly valued even though valuations are more stretched than 2021 by any metric.

That is all.

Data link above; As per self driving taxis:  Nobody is going to tell me any differently - with our societal problems I see that drug addicted people will hire them to shoot shit and bang their date leaving their mess around for the next pick up.  Who's cleaning that crap up?

Im not getting what it's all about and the details.  It's assuming that people behave appropriately while using them.  I don't see that.; RemindMe! 3 months; [deleted]; # You can only buy two individual stocks for the rest of your life (no ETFs). What are you buying?; Kudos to Tom Lee. He was one of the few to pump UBER during that August FUD. I think it got dismissed since he is a permabull plus it was anti-Mag 7 taking over an industry. By anti-Mag 7 I mean a lot on Reddit were saying Google or Tesla would create their own platform and that is the end of Uber. But all his bull cases turned out right.; Loving UBER so far.  Hoping it will break out.

New position as of 2 weeks ago.

\*\* edited \*\*  if it can close here and keep going a bit more it will have broken the range.  Of course far too early to say this may or may not happen.  Today's run up was very unexpected for me.; Meanwhile my Indonesian uber flat... lame; I feel like this with NET (and SQ to a degree). They basically just stay in a constant range and it annoys me lol; It’s something I definitely struggled with a lot in the past, but I am spread out quite widely that I don’t worry too much about individual positions. Maybe too much so, but that’s been the strategy I’ve been more comfortable with for now. But definitely something I’m still trying to improve on, getting the buy level right based on volatility and fundamentals and growth prospects. I bought AEHR a couple of days ago, and went in at a kind of middle level that I was quite comfortable with no matter the short term price action due to it being a very volatile stock despite my conviction being very high, and I’m pretty satisfied but still left with the niggling feeling that I should have gone a little higher to really match my level of conviction. It’s easy to take a biased view now that the price is up premarket after earnings though. Then again the price change is not so drastic that I can’t still quite comfortably add to my position considering it’s a not a quick trade I’m making. 

Trying to assess each trade in isolation I think is key, and not letting previous burns/wins cloud your judgement. And also to try to stay rational, and acknowledge that we’d get the feeling we should have bought more no matter what it is if we see the price going up. Got to really assess each time you buy if the price level is justified and not get too in love with a stock that you lose objective.; Market was pricing in robotaxis being ready this year or the next for TSLA. At same time punishing UBER that this possibility could come out this year or next.

Earliest is now 2026. So people headed for exits. Google already has robotaxis operating right now.; They are being outcompeted on every level.  Chinese EVs, Waymo.  Now they are trying to pivot to robotics/AI? but they're also playing catchup in that area as well.; Why? Investors would need to wait until 2026 for Cybercab to go into production.  That's if Tesla actually hit its timeline.  Also, it's not like Waymo and Cruise wouldn't be improving their tech even further in the next 2 years.; I think so too 👍; Side note… but were the robots being controlled remotely? Their behavior and voices were way too real imo; Why? Elon promising 2026 but that date has now shifted for a decade; Be greedy when others are greedy and fearful when others are fearful.; If the past 5 years repeat for the next 10 years I will be retired, lol.; I can't find anything interesting to invest. Already missed all the stocks that gained +50% in the last 6 months.

Where do you expect growth currently?; Rivian and Tesla eh?; man, all those words just to say nothing

the power of ChatGPT generated articles 

or maybe actual financial analysts are this fucking stupid and useless; +18.5% premarket is very nice to see, my nov 15c should be close to a double at open I think; Welcome back! I think it’s an easy 3 bagger in the next 2-3 years of Kamala wins; I'm also considering to buy... the only thing holding me back is the heavy competition and yet unknown US policies as a result of the election. But the current stock price looks tempting!; I'm holding. One of the reasons it is pumping is the market share numbers being put out. They have over 50% market share in several countries. Not even MELI or AMZN two companies that have had more positive sentiment have that much market share in their main markets.

The other is the companies are colluding with each other to increase take rates which would improve SE profitability.; I sold a lot of SPY back in October 2022 at $349 and those cash are still sitting in treasury   :(; Yep. I never sold. been amazing Hit 100K this year in Roths and 2% away from 150K all combined; We were due a good gain on CLS. I actually thought about selling a time or two. Impatience is my worst fault as an investor.; price to operating cash flow looks pretty cheap still, perhaps not the best metric objectively but kind of surprising, its only been much lower in 2008 and the worst of 2022; I’m selling covered calls at 300; Feelsgoodman.jpg; You holding your shares?; Added a little more when it dipped early today, was happy for that opportunity. Earnings were good. Its a very volatile stock so makes sense to be cautious but that can of course be a huge bonus if you get in at the right time and I thought it looked very strongly like it had bottomed. Not buying it for just a quick trade but I think it’s definitely one with the potential for big returns in a short time.; Thank Hazardous. hes the buy signal; Imagine sitting out waiting for the ""big one"" or heaven forbid being short into this kind of strength...; I'm not sure if you're actually being sarcastic here...the put/call ratio is very, very low and the euphoria on CNBC is incredibly, incredibly intense...not saying we are heading for a bear market, but this is how short to medium terms tops form. just can't get over valuations for some of the most concentrated names like Apple; Bull market?! I’m loosing my balls ova here!!!; Thats a beat, it should keep going.; P/E ratio is not the best thing to look at. You have to look at non-number stuff. One of the major bear cases and stuff holding down the stock was Tesla is coming for them their days are numbered. Well it turns out Tesla is still at least a couple years away. 

Once market realized this the price action between TSLA and UBER tells you what you need to know.; They just turned profitable for the first time like a year ago. We wont know their true value until they settle down with their capex and start focusing on profitability 

If you want to find their value you should look at revenue, number of bookings, number of rides, government legislation, market share, etc; ttm not useful in this case, 40 fwd pe isnt especially egregious for a growth company, fcf yield is 2.9%, if you look at analyst eps expectations you see that its mid transition with strong improvements expected next 4 years. Im not long but it doesnt look insane to me; Me; Pension funds, etc.; Why are the prices all to high? Amzn, meta, goog all within historical norms imo; Remember when BAC said there was 100% of recession within 12 months in October 2022? Cuz I remember; JPMorgan calls it?

Its official. The top is VERY close.; $R always shows up for me when I type r stocks to get here lol; Banks all reporting great quarterly numbers and growing optimism around soft landing with PCE numbers showing further disinflation.

>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, final demand inflation was unchanged in September, while the core reading grew more slowly at 0.2%. As a result, the year-ago numbers were 1.8% for all items and 2.8% for the core reading.
>
>These metrics imply that the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge of inflation, the personal consumption expenditures index, most likely grew at 0.2% for both the overall and core indicators in September.
>
>That would bring the year-over-year PCE inflation for all items to 2.1%, the lowest since February 2021; I bought a few shares a week or so ago after you and u/steel-rain- talked it up (although I couldn’t remember the name to save my life and I had to DM Steel rain for it). I like to take a small risk here and there and am in a good  position to do so. Hope it hits for all of us.; Been holding a little bit of this one for a while. I wish I averaged down, but glad I'm still holding.; I’m definitely onboard with this one and hold 11,700 shares but just a heads up the mods will delete your post and ban you. Happened to me on a different account. I was going to bring this one up once it meet the $5 share price criteria.; No context?; Probably just some type of biases. You can look into technical analysis if you want to learn to try to trade off indicators, but there are so many stocks out there that you can find some that will fit this pattern as much as some that won't.; Do you only notice when it goes up? Or do you not notice all the ones that stay down or go even further down; If you think the trailing 12 months EPS is the defining piece of information we should use then  go ahead and act on it. It’s not hard to see that the market is in a completely different place than the peak of 2021. There was no value to found at that time. I was having trouble finding a single stock that hadn’t gone parabolic. Now the market dynamics are clearly much more healthy, stocks are rising and then often falling drastically when they become clearly overvalued. It’s not hard to find beaten down stocks, there are entire sectors that are beaten down. Isn’t the main point of this sub stock picking after all?; Why does trailing earnings matter? fwd is all that matters; Users will need accounts, credit card verification, sign off on fine print that they can be liable for damages. Imagine signing a rental car agreement. That's essentially what users will sign off on when they create their accounts. Abusers will get banned pretty fast. 

You're way overestimating this problem. Lots of Uber drivers already have cameras inside for safety. It's possible self driving cars will go that route as well if this is a problem.; Is this a problem that waymo is having in their cars?

That's a fairly dismal view of society, so I'm sorry. However, there's plenty of free places to bang your date.

Will it happen? Probably. Will it be widespread? Who knows. Any fleet of vehicles is going to require cleaning just from wear and tear. Just people tracking in rain, snow, dirt, food....etc. These vehicles will likely need daily cleaning anyway.; Auto-cleaning is a much easier problem to solve than self-driving.; Waymo has been driving around SF for 2 years, and available to anyone with a smartphone since June. There are problems unique to self driving cars, but what you mention isn't one of them; This is sorted out by pricing. Uber for example introduced some La Guardia airport shuttle to/from NYC for $18 per person. People were mocking it as 'you have reinvented the bus' but on the other hand, people will gladly pay a little extra for a safe, clean, quiet, convenient experience when public transportation fails to meet those standards.

I'm a skeptic about self-driving taxis less so about the implementation and more that it won't be some revolutionary change to the fundamentals of the companies offering it. (I.e., Tesla is overpriced); What will probably happen is UBER or if you feel another company will be that platform will probably take from ABNB and have cleaning fee included.

I think these overhead costs such as cleaning and maintain the vehicles is exactly why Google or Tesla wont join in. Since they can just provide the cars and not deal with that upkeep for higher margins.; [deleted]; Will your account be around in 3 months?  90% of the accounts here that are < 6 months old are alts of someone who was banned or someone who deletes their account periodically.

|-|-|-|-|; Now only 8x p/s, 65 fwd pe, 0.22% fcf yield, with declining gross margins and expected negative y/y eps, looks very cheap indeed; Tom Lee is a permabear?!; GRAB? Maybe it a situation that company isnt a part of the algos that panic sell or panic buy based off robotaxi news.; I feel you, have a few stocks like that, whenever it gets close to the upper resistance I want it to go up, but then I also want to buy more... then it goes down and I want it to stay up LOL; Thanks for this, it's reassuring, and great advice!

Do you actively sell your positions if you are happy with the gains, or you just try to get the right buy price/volume and then hold long term?; But Musk has humanoid robots clearly ready for mass production sub $50k. Stock needs to pump to $400 a share.; 2030…; Consensus on Twitter was teleo operators; The problem with this quote is people say it all the time, every year at entirely the wrong times because their idea of fear and greed in the market in very subjective. The point is to identify irrational positivity that can’t really be justified, and irrational fear. There are very few times when the market on the whole goes to these extremes. If you think it’s there now and are investing/ not investing based on it I hope you have a lot of information and experience to back it up because people miss out on the market for years with repeating this mantra. I think on the whole it does more harm than good for the average investor. Going on your gut or just the trailing 12 month PE is not enough for me at these levels. I don’t see a market devoid of value.; PEs unfortately cannot just expand forever.... right?; I think the issue is your reading comprehension because that sentence very clearly states that inflation is tame, which isn't saying nothing.; Did you sell in the, checks notes, 10min window it was +15ish%?; That's the big risk with this one. If she doesn't win, then what? From what I understand, it'll still receive benefits from the IRA until 2029, but I don't know if that's adequate; Thanks for this information, good sir. It's very hard to find a lot on SE these days since it's not the shiny star anymore. Very much appreciating the return this year; Damn, at the absolute bottom too....

Why did you never renetered in 2023 or early 2024.

Fact is were going to 6k soon.; I am not selling yet since I think valuation is very reasonable for getting ai taiwind exposure, its actually pretty tough outside of DELL/SMCI which I dont want to own to find AI exposure at less than 20x fwd pe; fair point, probably should do more DD on it again. Saw the price in may, bought it and forgot about it until I checked today lol; I trimmed some + calls still have core, tbh I did not think the Q was spectacular although I do think its more evidence the bottom is either behind AEHR or close to done. Other irons in the fire is good, but nothing concrete yet; Yeah I agree, if you are the type of person that follows financial news/stock markets, it’s tough to sit this one out. I do personally know people that have much, much more money than me who have zero stocks though.; Can’t say I’ve watched CNBC at all in the last 5 years, it’s financial soap opera/entertainment. 

Stocks like to way overshoot to the upside in a good bull, which can last for multiple years at stretched valuations; The market is not euphoric.  In any definition or sense of the word.  

You will see euphoria one day as along as we dont fall into a recession.  And we still very well could though I truly doubt it.  

Lets climb this wall of worry and worry we shall.; I get that I just get the feeling this is coming up to a short squeeze and a priced to perfection moment for forward earnings.

In other words, if earnings fail to blow away it will plummet like Intel stock on a typical day.

I'll edit this and say 35 million volume I doubt this is a short squeeze though could be wrong.; Appreciate your comment and see your point.  Thanks!; Those 3 are all still very cheap right now; I buy Q’s weekly; That not how the market works but okay sure.; I’ve posted on it many times, starting when it was around 80; must be why we've had at least one Fed member come out and say rate cuts could be paused for November...I'm sure the bond market will love that if it happens...; Thought it was based on MKT Cap not Share price.

Its well over 1B fully diluted now. Not being able to mention it is pretty dumb, but rules are rules I guess.; I like his insights.; Thanks!! Will check it out. I’m pretty new to buying individual stocks. Appreciate it; Touché. Haven’t done a deep dive on this, but just eyeballed the last 5 days for Tesla and Broadcomm right now and they follow the pattern I suggested. I understand it can go both ways; I agree the euphoria isn't as intense as it was in '21....but then you see names like PLTR, CAVA, COST....and friggin' WING...what is the justification for those valuations?; There was plenty of value in late 2021. Some people stood all their overvalued indices and went into oil and gas and coal and made over 100% in 2022. 

There is always value in thr market. But when indices are at bubble valuations, finding that value is very hard.; Generally speaking forward earnings estimates are just current trends extrapolated forwards. There are exceptions like NVDA, but at a market level, higher EPS growth leads to higher forward EPS growth estimates.; Self driving cars is an exciting and a plausible business but the challenges are not just self driving vehicles.  Anyone who lives inside a city knows exactly what I am talking about.  Go to Seattle, Chicago, wherever... it's not good.  

The point is I believe it's still a long ways away and even if it is any nonsense that happens will be met with a strong response from licensing agencies and insurance cutting into profits possibly substantially.  

Nobody wants self driving cars and taxis more than I do, but widespread use or any use is a long ways off yet.; Sure hope they are working on the robots in step with the substantial challenges of self driving.

It's a great dream to have, but there is much more work to be done than most people realize.; Last time I rode the bus in the US a guy was smoking on it, US public transportation sucks and id much rather ride Uber's shuttle; Yep they strip you naked and whip your bare ass with a cane.  That won't happen elsewhere.; I'll be here! God willing <3
And i'll give you a hug!

RemindMe! 3 Months; yeah but eventually we will colonize mars using TSLA bots and the price should be inifinity.; To say nothing of a CEO who has politically alienated the demographic most likely to purchase his products; Meant Permabull. Every thing else in post aligned with bullishness just made typo with saying permabear.; Yea, it tends to just barcode around except on earnings lol, too little coverage I suppose... upside is that leaps are very cheap; Exactly, if it goes up I’m happy and if it goes down I can buy more, but when it just moves up and down in a range it gets annoying 😂; I haven’t been selling much recently, mostly just some stocks that have underperformed that I realise I probably shouldn’t have bought in the first place as I learn more. I have some stocks that I see as very high momentum that I bought mostly just to trade short term that I’m keeping a close eye on in particular and will hope to sell in the next year and others that I plan to hold for the long term. I thought I was clever when I sold Meta for 300 after buying fairly close to lows, and I’ve seen it go on to 600 from afar. I think on the whole the fewer decisions I make the better regarding buying and selling if interested in a company longer term. I’m still reassessing fairly often though. I’m hoping to in the future not be buying and selling much and just have my established positions for the most part, every now and then open a new one and trade options when good opportunities arise. My actions right now also have tax in mind though, I don’t want to have a big tax bill next year from selling companies in profit but have wanted to invest in some companies I didn’t have spare cash waiting for so I exited positions I was down or flat on.

Edit: But to answer your original question more plainly I don’t have a clear profit taking strategy other than selling if I think a valuation has gotten way ahead of what can be justified. I haven’t felt like I’ve been in that position too often, but I also am not sure how good I am at identifying that on the whole.; AI = Actual Indians; When governments across the world print this much money, and no one really knows where to put it..... I mean PEs might naturally have to expand.; Why not? It has been the case for the last 10yrs for sure. Maybe it's an outdated metric?; Yea, got out with some gains but not the double I wanted lol... that was fast to drop down again; Now up 22%🤭; Yea. It all depends on the capex. SE could be continuing to invest in logistics which might not make it profitable now. Which short term investors want to see but would pay off in the future.; People kept saying it was a dead cat bounce and rates will still keep going up.; Give us a hint when you think it may be time to exit. I am terrible at exits and have lost a good bit by failing to sell At the right time.; Honestly AEHR is dirt cheap right now. There is a lot of room to run. The share was justifiably penalised for only focusing on electric vehicles, for which sales have left much to be desired in recent months. However, AEHR is the cost leader in testing and burn-in of various chip types. Focusing on sectors where demand for chips remains strong is very bullish in my opinion.; Would be nice for some similar action from ON; So do I. They all had small loans of millions of dollars; we've had plenty of bull markets that have not reached these valuations, which are basically near 2021 levels...and secondly, out of any stock in Warren Buffet's portfolio, why did he choose to offload a lot of Apple if it still has more upside?; Big banks constantly create liquidity for themselves or clients through the media. Thats literally how it works.

Like how china was uninvestable, but after a 40% rally all the banks are saying its time to go long.... riiiiiiiight; Okay, go ahead and keep betting against the US economy. It'll work eventually.; Bigtime strength into the close to set a new high on the year. If the DOE loan comes through I think we see a +15-20% day.; Hoping to really talk it up at 5, lmao also your post is outdated, it’s already at 3.07 😂; Totally. 

Honestly biases is a big thing with investing or just general life. Here's an example of some just with investing alone: 

[https://www.forbes.com/advisor/in/investing/4-common-investment-biases-you-should-avoid/](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/in/investing/4-common-investment-biases-you-should-avoid/); 5 days, for two companies, is such a small sample size, that projecting strategies using just that pattern would almost definitely result in something unexpected; The way I see it the market is in a place where confidence is very high overall and bubbles and overvaluations can and do pop up, but I’m not fearful about the market on the whole, I just don’t buy those companies. I don’t see it as a reason to turn your back on the market or buy puts on the market as some people do.; Oil went up bc Russia invaded Ukraine, they weren't genius' who discovered a massive structural undervaluation or something.; Perhaps, but for a lot of names 2022 was a trough then 2023 normalization and now they are getting back into gear seemingly... Thinking of like META; Do you know if waymo has problems with this? They operate exclusively in cities. 

Also, most of the ""not good"" of those cities is over exaggerated by people who don't live there. San Francisco definitely has some problems going, so it's basically a worst case test for your thesis.; [deleted]; Its ok I forgive you; [deleted]; So now you have seen the real truth with your own eyes.  No one knows anything, so never listen to anyone. Buy only top notch equity, but never to much of one thing or index it and hold for long periods of time. anything else and your a gambler. A gambler could make a lot and could also lose it all. Over time the house always wins.  Ready for my down votes!. I'll cry all the way to comfortable retirement.; Still doesn't explain why you wouldn't enter when fed signaled cuts in Dec 2023...

Also, bears are historcally wrongs. Also. People on this sub had called March 2020 a dead count bounce. And well we saw what happen. But also why not buy the dip in April or August?; If it gets above 20 fwd pe I will likely begin trimming/selling down and then play it by ear per earnings from then on; If they execute as management thinks then I agree but until we get further hard proof in the form of revenue it's pretty high risk high reward imo; True, if this is a bottom for sic I think on, infineon, stm, etc all good risk/reward here; These valuations are higher than 2021. SPY is up 20%+ vs those highs and earnings arent even up 10% last I checked. 

Just more PE expansion in the everything bubble; You’ve made some good points but I’m not sure what to do about them. I don’t own any apple other than through the index funds in retirement accounts; You haven't been around long enough to be trading. But okay whatever helps you.; not betting against the economy, I think it actually has more juice than people realize...I AM betting against the immaculate disinflation narrative...2% is a pipe dream imo...what will happen to rents when multifamily apartment availability dries up in the next 6 months? Why do you think Blackrock has begun to buy hoards of apartment buildings across the country again?; I trimmed today. Lots of untested FVGs below that I see getting visited soon. 

DOE loan will be much more than a20% day imo; problem is the mag7 is still a concentrated segment of the S&P500 and (as a whole) is just as expensive forward p/e wise as it was in peak-2021...; Coal bros were doing great even without Russia invasion. The increase in coal prices was obvious to happen.; so what about one of the most concentrated names in the S&P500? AAPL...33x fwd p/e with low single-digit revenue growth...what is the justification for that premium?

Why would Warren Buffet specifically get out of that name but keep others?; look at META earnings over time its the same shit.

13.77 EPS in 2021, peaked at 380ish a share.

Last 12 months has been 19.56, stock is at 590 now. PE is a good amount higher than its peak in 2021. And META EPS growth is going to be less in the next 12 months than it was in the 12 months heading into the 2021 peak.

We are just seeing an epic melt up on almost everything from PE expansion.; Keep hoping in the meantime, the current state of affairs dictates what will happen.  

They need service centres and people to clean up needles, loads, underwear, vomit, whatever.  I doubt that self driving cars have the ability to hold people hostage while police come.

The thing is, dreams are great until you start thinking of the challenges that must be met. 

It's a good dream, how do you make it reality?  Much more work needs to be done.; The stock gained 35% in a week. No place for pessimism lol; Regarding ""But also why not buy the dip in April or August?"", if you think it's a dead cat bounce then when you see it start going down you think it's the downside of the bounce, not a short term dip; Thats true. However, there were several insider purchases before earnings, so let’s hope for the best!; Not to worry the opportunity to buy in at current highs will come any year now mang; alright, you trust the sell side of a major bank who is known for calling tops/bottoms at the worst time. 

ill trust history and how funds operate.; > Why do you think Blackrock has begun to buy hoards of apartment buildings across the country again?

Not go to on too much of a tangent, but I agree. These big guys teaming up with RealPage is driving incredible shelter inflation; Gotcha. I don’t trade on technical indicators at all. Just some light swing trading here and there. With EOSE I’m holding for gold (hopefully) so far I’m over 20k in the green! Small peanuts for some, but not me; Yeah, such an obvious spike right after the invasion. Completely predictable giant spike out of nowhere...

https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/coal; Valid point, but I don't think anyone truly even knows how to spot a DCB its something everyone now a day throws around. But also, April & August showed 0 text-book signs of DCB. Iran/Israel caused them sell off in April, and Japan in August.; I like the ceo, good management difficult to find in microcaps, he is for sure optimistic but I dont think dishonest/shady; Yes,  I trust history and how funds operate look at NAAIM and it has been increasing, bank earnings have been great as of today. Tech kicks off next week. Semis are bound for a huge upswing, QQQ hasn't made ATH in 3 months neither has msft, amzn, AAPL and googl.

But you do you buba; Nice man that's great to hear. I think there's a lot more coming in the next few years; you also see the big run up leading up to that due to supply shortages, the increased need for spot demand as renewables grew, and certain regions changing policy. 

All this was leading to the price increases, and the looming energy crisis gave Russia more power allowing them to invade.

Whatever, ill enjoy my >100% return in 2022.; I agree, but the person said they thought it was a dead cat bounce, so that's what they saw.; Yes, but we’re on a point that all of that is expected. We expect stellar earnings and nothing less. A lot is primed for perfection. 

It’s all gucci if they can deliver, but one slip and the narrative changes. We’re walking on eggshells.; If it goes to 20, then my kids college is taken care of. Let’s goooooooook. Lmao.; Alright, keep living in 2022.; Yeah, well they learned a valuable lesson.; I sold out at 3.55 at open.

Havent bought any back yet, I see a lot of targets down that look like they will get taken out.; Good luck! I hope you find another entry. I’m staying long!"

Forex Macro Strategy Advice,"

So here’s my attempt at using macro indicators and applying a statistical approach to generate a bias on a currency pair. 
I’ve been backtesting it but so far I haven’t achieved the results I want. I’m hoping someone here has more experience can help me get on the right path or just outright tell me my idea isn’t going to work. 

The principle is to score economic indicators and their impact on GDP, so when a new indicator is published my algorithm will calculate the score for that indicator and all the previous indicators released in the last 30 days and then calculate an average score for that country. In theory if I do the same for the other currency in the pair I can determine which one is stronger/weaker and then use TA to make an entry. 

 The following section will outline how I calculate the score. Each score is made up of , the relationship of the indicator to GDP

I’ll explain with an example. 
Let’s consider unemployment over the course of 2010-2015 these are the the steps I followed: 

## Preparing the Data
My data is in a dataframe (think of it like excel but in python) with three columns. The first. Column contains the date when the indicator is published the second column contains the unemployment value and the third the GDP value. Since GDP comes out quarterly and unemployment monthly I have computed intermediate GDP values linearly. The result is that the unemployment and GDP columns have the same number of entries. 

## Calculating lag between unemployment and GDP
To calculate the lag between unemployment and its effect on GDP, I used the Granger Casuality test as a starting point but this number can be tweaked later. Let’s say unemployment lags GDP by 3 months, so the effects of an increase in unemployment will show on the economy 3 months later. 
Finally, since unemployment lags GDP by 3 months I need to align the unemployment timeseries with the GDP timeseries by shifting GDP forward by 3 months, that way the unemployment level and its corresponding GDP levels are aligned. 

## Associating unemployment levels with GDP
The next step in the process is to associate unemployment levels with GDP. To do this I split up the unemployment timeseries into bins of let’s say 0.5%. This would look something like:
0%-0.5% , 0.5%-1% …. 2% - 2.5%, 3%-3.5% etc. 
Now for each bin I calculate the average GDP across my data. So for example to calculate the average GDP between 2-%-2.5% I go through my (shifted) and compute the average GDP of every row which has unemployment within that range. I do this across all the bins and the result is a new data frame with bin ranges in one column and the average GDP value for that range across the whole dataset in the second column. 

Now that unemployment levels are associated with their respective average GDP I can calculate a score for unemployment. 

## Scoring unemployment
We’re at a point now where we have a dataframe with bins in one column and average GDP for each bin in the other. I now simply create a linear score from -10 to +10 for each unemployment level. So the lowest average GDP value would get a score of -10 and the highest GDP value will get a score of +10. 

So the data frame looks something like:

| Bins   | GDP | Score |
|--------|-----|-------|
| 0-0.5% | 6   | 10    |
| 1-1.5% | 5   | 8     |
| 1.5-2% | 3   | 5     |
| …      | …   | …     |
| 6-6.5% | 2   | -10   |

This is just an example, there’s a lot more data in the actual analysis. 

## Scoring newly published data
Now when a new unemployment value comes out, all I have to do is find which bin it corresponds to and look up the score for that bin. The idea is that if I do this with say 5-10 indicators and average their scores and do the same with another country I can determine which one is stronger/weaker.

Apologies for the long post and any potential typos (typing from my phone). 

Any help, (constructive) criticism, advice or general comments are appreciated!",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1g00zz4/forex_macro_strategy_advice/,5,"Your idea isn't going to work.

First of all, just as a general rule, any consistent alpha that you can get via algorithm is probably going to get picked up by the big boys in the market and thus bid out of existence long before you can take advantage.

Secondly, you plan to use 'TA' to get an entry point, but TA is basically not a thing, not for currency or for most tradable entities.

Thirdly, your plan is to use national statistics, but almost every country is going to collect this data in different ways, with different lag times, and different meanings, and with lots of room for local bias. You can use them for simple comparisons but as inputs to a sophisticated algorithm you're going to bump against their inconsistency a lot.; Chat GPT SLOP; Thanks for your input. The goal is to get a bias on the currencies not to give me a bias not to automatically i buy/sell for me. 

While I agree that different countries collect data in different ways, I’m not comparing one indicator to another but rather the effect of that indicator to GDP. 

Anyways I think you might be right it’s something too complex and with too many variables to reduce it to a simple algorithm.; Why because I’ve used headings and made a table? 
Have you ever used chat gpt? Because the answers it

TSMC's revenue for September surged 39.6% YoY,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) revenue for September surged 39.6% year-over-year to about NT$251.87B amid growing demand for artificial intelligence chips for use in AI products.

TSM — which produces chips for some of the world's largest tech companies including Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) — saw September-quarter revenue of NT$759.69B (adding revenues for July NT$256.95B, August NT$250.87B and September NT$251.87B) (about $23.6B).

The average analyst forecast is NT$748B, according to a report by Bloomberg News.

While announcing its second quarter results in July, TSM said it expected third quarter revenue to be between $22.4B and $23.2B (midpoint of $22.8B). For the third quarter, the company expected its business to be helped by strong smartphone and AI-related demand for its leading-edge process technologies.

Month-over-month TSM's revenue rose 0.4% as it had generated NT$250.87B in revenue in August.

TSM is slated to report its third quarter results on Oct. 17.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fznfk0/tsmcs_revenue_for_september_surged_396_yoy/,90,"One of the best and largest holdings in my portfolio.; The crash back in August was such a good jump in point.

But as individual investors these things may not matter as much.; If China invades Taiwan no stock is safe. In addition it is not in China’s interest to create instability.

Smaller Companies With Long Term Potential?,"This is a continuation of a post last year: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/16jn32s/smaller\_companies\_with\_long\_term\_potential/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/16jn32s/smaller_companies_with_long_term_potential/)

If you read the comments you will notice a lot of the companies mentioned performed exceptionally well for the most part. Figured it would be good to continue this tradition as we approach 2025.

From the post:  
""This is Stocks, would like to see discussion outside of tech and ETFs. I'd like to try to identify smaller companies with long term potential, there's a few which am considering investing for next decade.

I'm not considering buy now, when fear and greed index takes another nose dive and another crisis starts I'd like to then DCA into these companies. The most famous art dealers will buy hundreds of paintings and hold long term, it's only a handful which actually explode immensely in value.

Rational is don't need to get everything right, but finding a 10x with a company near 5b market cap is more realistic imo than expecting Apple to x10 with current 2.7t market cap. There's also too much concentration in these massive behemoths which makes me rather want to invest in ETFs like QQQ and then have few moonshots on the side such as listed. What companies do you have in mind? Thoughts?""",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fz7xn0/smaller_companies_with_long_term_potential/,61,"I did pretty well with my picks last year, TMDX in particular absolutely carried my portfolio at various times. Of the names I listed I still hold TMDX, PCOR, & GTLB. Some of the others I had owned but sold for various reasons, would still buy FROG, MNDY, or DOCN at the right price. Perhaps PATH if  I felt better about their tools beyond just rpa.

Between the last post & now I bought the dip on 
U, believing the company can right the ship. SYM, because I like the clear backlog view/institutional support, and S as i’d always liked the company/metrics. I liked my entry points, idk that I’d buy at current entry.

Right now, I like: 

I’ll add PCOR on any dips to the lower 50s.

ESTA, MBLY, & RBRK as higher confidence picks at current prices.

NVTS as my tiny semiconductor upside pick at current price.

EXFY & SHLS as what I’d deem higher risk value plays, but companies I’d likely sell at a defined return %.; Vulcan energy resources; Let's see those bags 👀👀; RKLB; ENVX; Lunr - I wont elaborate because this is not some hidden gem.... 



But the current LUNR fakeout & dump is suspiciously similar to the pre-NSNS pt 1 contract announcement day…

Bought 15 k shares @ 7.25

Nov 11 is the big earnings day - and also, lunr Wil be sending over their assembly to nasa and prolly announce that…

Jan or thereabouts is the moon landing…

It’s selling for peanuts here and MMs doing a proper shakeout considering the low float.

No such thing as a sure fire winner, but this might just be it….; The main 3 small companies I think with some 10x potential is:


RKLB: most conviction as they have the vertical abilities to truly dominate the space industry. 



HIMS: lots of competition with online pharma sales, but HIMS is the clear winner so far. Some volatility around whether they can continue selling GLP-1, but they haven’t actually had a Q report with the sales added and still had 70%+ growth so keeping GLP is just a cherry on top tho most people probably don’t realize that and it will likely dip if they lose access to GLPs. 




RMAX: I’m really thinking more a 5x, but if they kick in the dividend again and I keep the low cost basis then the dividend returns will be huge. 




RDW: still researching, but strong analayst expectations and micro cap space stock. I like what I see so far and might have some potential with contracts.; Fn, NSIT, ATKR; $PTLO - Beef; Rddt; CLOV; QXO. $5B cash pile managed by Brad Jacobs, who previously built successful roll-ups in XPO and United Rentals (you can see the long-term charts) and United Waste (which was sold.) This new roll-up will focus on building materials cos. 

https://www.freightwaves.com/news/oppenheimer-analysts-see-fertile-ground-for-jacobs-plans-at-new-venture-qxo; A company I’ve been keeping my eyes on is BlackBerry. I know I know, people will have a kneejerk reaction seeing that especially due to the meme stock phase it had back a few years ago. Also, people keep thinking of it as the phone company it used to be. It’s a cybersecurity and software company. It operates through the following segments: cybersecurity, IoT, and licensing.

* it’s QNX software is built into nearly every in-car technology systems. Also, that software provides secure, reliable, and is scalable for systems that are designed to support critical applications where failure or downtime is not acceptable. It’s already huge in automotive but making big leaps in cybersecurity, industrial automation, medical devices, and telecommunications.

* its cybersecurity business is growing well

* strong potential in gaining a foothold in emerging trends like autonomous vehicles, 5g, and IoT

* recent earnings report was one of those weird ones where it was mostly positive but they made a future forecast adjustment to be slightly less than expected (though still growing) so all the news focused on adjusting future outlooks despite revenue increases across numerous areas of its business 

* low price point currently. I just started a position a few weeks ago (not a big one but starting to build it up) and planning to hold long term. 

Yeah, i know this stock has negative sentiment due to the previous meme stock nature people tried to make it out to be a few years ago but i do think this company has a lot of potential for the future!; RKLB, ASTS, RDW; GLBE has a lot of potential but is on the riskier side. They’re a leader in across-borders fintech. They offer both translation services and currency exchange, which makes things a lot easier for their clients. GLBE is also integrated into Shopify. The company is profitable in a non-GAAP basis (which is typical of high growth companies in their growth phase) and free cash flow profitability. Revenue growth is robust at 26%. Cons are low gross margins and susceptibility to seasonality and economic slowdowns.; I actually did well and own 2/3 of the names I threw out last time!

ODD- cosmetics company out of Israel that's investing a lot in development and AI. They're building out a platform to develop cosmetics, as well as their own lines. 

CHCI- real estate development company with investment from the founder/CEO of NVR. Asset light and solid growth. 

TRNS- I like this one, barring the valuation being high. They do calibration and laboratory instrument servicing. Like a small version of an MTD.; Grindr, Elite Pharmaceuticals, Match Group, California Nanotechnologies; Microvast, cmpletely vertically integrated battery manufacturer. From raw material to complete battery systems.

Market leading tech stack, consistent YoY revenue growth, improving EPS, improving cash flow. $70M marketcap but did $300M in revenue last year and probably $500M this year. I have it at a $20 valuation but it's trading at 20 cents. Down big due to declining cash on hand, and fumbling a US factory, but very likely to break even this qaurter and resume it's US operations. Currently has to ship batteries from Germany and China, but hopefully can start earning IRA credits. 

Nearly 100% of people who read this won't buy it so that's all I have for now.; Any of the top 4 US cannabis companies.; Cellebrite - CLBT.  When the military or law enforcement need to get into phones with warrants or search a digital space for evidence, Cellebrite is what they use.  Growing government contracts and a growing demand for their product that will only grow and compound.; GPN,SSTK,SOFI,APTV,NU; C3, Astera Labs, ASTS, LUNR, Soun; EGY; [deleted]; hims & hers; I have a decent position in ELTP. The pipeline is pretty solid, they are profitable already and with the new facility they will be able to ramp up production, get more revenue going and hopefully invest that into more R&D. Price is still very low and I’m holding long term and adding positions regularly.; Clne ,clean energy fuels; IVKTX just announced more positive pretrial results, and there’s been rumour of a pfizer buyout; FEMY, they will be insanely impactful for nations across the globe in 2 different ways.; PCT; Fastned; Google; I've bought some shares. Up 170% so far. Tempting to sell because I've been burnt by stuff like this before, but this seems more promising long term. And it's only 3% of my portfolio. How are you feeling about it now mate? My mother gave me £300 to invest in it so I've got pressure now haha.; KRKNF; GRND. I’ve heard great things about this company. Good upside potential, pumped sales and hard earnings; I think GoPro will get bought out by a social media company who will tie it in to their platform (and in the process ruin GoPro via enshittification) but such is life; Senseonics. They do under skin glucose monitors. Reckon that stuff is seeping into the culture. I think in 10 years time even non diabetics will get an implant to monitor health.; What’s interesting is that when you invest into smaller cap companies you are expected to be risk taker, but historically big cap companies have been outperforming small cap ones.  So the bottom line is VOO.; Have continued to buy TMDX and am holding DOCS. PRCT has to be my favorite. An incredible product and a company that’s growing rapidly.; Well said! Love the tier list of confidence and potential outcomes.; Zero carbon lithium from Europe/Germany and geothermal energy in one wash sounds like a no-brainer to me :D 
I'm just a little bit too thrilled about their concept. I went in knee deep haha; I have lost like 5€ on this company after investing 10€. Would not increase that as Germany is infamous for stopping mining and other projects due to local politics. They already stopped some geothermal energy projects because of nimbys.; Is RKLB too high priced right now to get into? I bought about 100$ worth of stocks on it last year and I'm 110% on that and I was planning on buying more when it was around 4.5$ but didn't pull the trigger. 

Is it worth buying it around 10$ or is it better to wait to see if it drops?; Lunr is better; This are really good small companies; This is a serious long term investment. Great find man!; What’s up with the massive dump it took this year?; Came here to say $BB as well.

Now every camera at every red bull event is a gopro.; By the time I came across PRCT there just hasn’t been a buying point I liked, so it sits on my watch; I hope you still have them! 😂💪; I wish it was on trade republic; Long story short: QXO essentially became public via a merger deal with a very, very small software company that had a very, verrrrrry small float. There was a MAJOR short squeeze for a bit, then when new shares were released, the short squeeze ended in a hurry - it was down about 80% in a day.; Tummy ache; Not heavy at all. I have $1k at 2.28 started about a week ago. I never participated in the meme stock phase years ago if that’s what you are implying; Regard; Declining cash is a real concern. They sold some equity for cash a few years ago and used it to expand their factory as well as convert what was a very manual process to what is now a automated lines. What was also a huge money pit was trying to build a US factory. Since then they have stopped all US expansion. 

Although the company is US registered, pays US taxes, and collaborates with US universities, it's been targeted by Two anti-EV senators. It is an easy target because the CEO is Chinese and although it has a global footprint it's main cell plant is in China. They have had a hard time getting US government support, but simultaneously cannot get support in China due to it being considered a foreign company.

I believe the plan now is to pause the US plant, which included selling some assets. They will build a plant in South Korea. In addition the automated lines are now online. They were at rush of bankruptcy but then last quarter they went from $30M to $60M can. The CEO in addition personally gave the company additional cash. I expect that this quarter they will go from $60M to $110M+ plus while also being cash flow positive, alleviating any bankruptcy concerns. 

It's down because it's been shorted to hell for to how it IPO'd. Rightfully so most deserved to be shorted but like ASTS there are a few that are diamonds in the rough. I think this is one of them. E.g they most likely are the ones providing all the battery systems for the USPS EVs. They claim they've never had a system catch fire. Unfortunately due to politics it's all under NDA.; That 100 is now 400. I still think it will come back down though :D. But let's see.; Ok that makes sense. Ima look into this one deeper, thanks for the tip."
Question about long-term and short-term sales,"Let's say for example I own 100 shares of Apple and I bought them 10 years ago. And then I bought two more shares of Apple yesterday. In a month from now I sell two shares. Or five, whatever. Do the shares that I'm selling count as short-term or long-term gains considering I've had shares for years, and that I've recently bought more shares.

Do you get the urge to gamble (with stocks) and how you deal with it. ,"So in a few accounts I have accumulated 100k+ over the years with the usual advise of S&P 500 index funds - set it and forget. But every few months I get the urge to sell a part of it and gamble in individual stocks. I did that with Tesla in 2018 (yes it was kind of a gamble then) and that paid off, a few others paid off too but then some didn’t pay off. Overall, am I beating the market? - I am not sure with rollovers from one job to the next that don’t keep track of previous account gains. But I am not loosing either with the strategy. How do you keep this urge/itch away? Just keeping it in S&P 500 is so boring. 

EDIT: based on comments I want to add that I do gamble in casinos table games but not more than $500-$1000 a year. It’s fun but I have the thinking that I will loose that 100%. The high from stocks which is 1k-10k gain in a short time is at another level. I don’t bet on penny stocks. These are mostly blue chip like when APPLE or AMAZON or CHIPOTLE does down, I would buy it and then sell in 1-6 months or just sit on it until it goes up. Sometimes stocks like NEO never go up. I also only SELL options. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1fyl2h9/do_you_get_the_urge_to_gamble_with_stocks_and_how/,89,"Look at it less. Find other hobbies. Or accept that you enjoy it but give yourself a strict allowance, like under 10% of your portfolio or $X per year; I usually take 10-20% of what I would put in index and play the table with the rest. That way when I bet on stocks, I'm not losing that much when I lose but I still get the rush of winning with the ones that do well and the performance of the index.; Been there, done that.

Investments should be boring. If you want to play with speculative gambling, 95% of your portfolio should be in boring stuff that will just continue doing its thing. When you understand how exponential growth works, you start to realize that 8-11% average is pretty darn amazing.

The other 5%? Go play. Have fun. Don't be stupid. If you lose it all, don't go grabbing another 5% from your core portfolio. Write down trading rules for yourself while you're calm and collected. Entry points, exit points, what your requirements are to initiate a trade, to close. Your risk levels. Your take profits, and how you split up that cash to cover taxes and putting some back into your core positions. Never change those rules mid-trade or when something is shiny in front of you. You can change it later.

I was actually pretty good at slightly edging out the market. But the amount of time, energy, effort, and mental space wasn't worth it for the 1-2% higher annualized return. And that was likely a fluke, statistically.

I can't rightfully tell you not to do something I did. But I can tell you I didn't find it worthwhile. At this point the only time I really do anything remotely exotic is using covered calls to liquidate positions, and the occasional LEAPS on an index.; You can play low stakes poker as a hobby instead. You’ll experience all the benefits and costs of variance, learn how you can make all the right decisions and still lose, and you’ll probably have more fun than gambling tons of money on stocks.; I set the following conditions for myself:

I’ll invest a max of 1% of my overall portfolio value on individual stocks up to a total of 10% (10 stocks x 1% each)

I automatically sell if the stock drops 10% below purchase price and will look for something else.

There is no perfect system, but this forces me to focus on valuation and other factors. Specifically I’ve used this approach to invest in Apple since 2014 and Visa since 2008, and I’ve never sold a share of either. I’ve had my share of bad choices, but they typically come when I don’t follow my own rules and I’ve gotten better at this over time.; Use tax loss harvesting to your advantage if you wanna make some risky investments, this is not financial advice of course.; I never sell anything to gamble, If I get the urge I tell myself i'm ""going to the casino"" and transfer a few hundred in from my checking account. place my bet (normally 0DTE SPY Calls) and have a ball. If I make a few bucks I go and buy myself lunch or buy a round for my friends at the bar, If I lose I lick my wounds until they heal about a month later and do it again.; I just remind myself that everyone has a stock story but the stories with happy endings usually go like this... ""So, there I was, fully invested long term in broad based index funds. The end."".; ~2% of my Nw is in individual stocks. Lets me gamble but doesn’t move the needle either way; Try putting some in a BTC ETF.  It gets the job done.; I keep the itch away by remembering I lost 100k attempting to day trade and chase and then I don’t; I DCA every Monday so I feel like I’m in on the action when the reality is that I’m not; I have $500k in individual stocks, over $100k in just my company stock alone (TMUS) that's gone from $25/share to over $200 now in the 12 years I've been there. When the market goes down I feel the pain but that's the time to buy into high quality stocks like the FAANG group. If you're young enough, buy individual stocks and also buy ETFS like SCHD/SCHG/QQQM. Key is to diversify at least somewhat but if you like to gamble go ahead and buy high quality stocks that will be around forever. When there is a market correction load up on Amazon/Microsoft/AMD/Apple/Nvidia/etc. Those companies are not going out of business anytime soon. Buy at reasonable prices and hold for decades.; I use 10% of my investments to sell short options. I realized I like to gamble just not sports or the lottery, so I control it. Ben Graham recommends knowing the difference between investment and speculation, limiting to 10% of funds and using a totally separate account. So I follow that except it’s not a separate account.; I do make small investments in speculation but only look at my actual total portfolio about twice a year (it used to be even less than that but I am getting ready to retire so a little more monitoring and figuring)
I do use Investopedia simulators to scratch the chasing Alpha itch and I check those several times a day for both the competitive and tracking/ learning
But I also am at the point where I need fewer not more holdings so some things I might do to have a net decrease in number of holdings
I think in retirement i may sell covered calls (I'm ok if they get called away because that can result in decreasing number of holdings),  but that (and simulators) is probably the closest I will get to trading after 40 years of accumulation and compounding; Yes...

Why? Because I purchased $300 of a stock and it 5-25x and it stayed there.. multiple times

Now when I get the feeling I up the Ante... I'm looking at you ASTS / NVDA / META / RKLB; No, I know I don't have an edge in the equities markets.

If you want to look at how much money the people who may have an edge get paid you'll realize you're probably dumb money.

https://www.reddit.com/r/quant/comments/18lst38/2023_quant_total_compensation_thread/; I have different accounts with different goals. Gambling is my YOLO account and I’m never going to stop 0DTE options. They’re too much fun.; Never been a gambler.  Have gambled - hate losing.  Don't really love winning that much.  More like winning is a huge sigh of relief that I didn't lose.  If that's not how you feel - if you love that high of winning, really gotta watch that mate.; Just go check the losses at WSB.


And do not assume that you are better than them in any aspect of trading. Remember that you are one meme stock trade away from a -99% or bankruptcy (see some option trades).; just dont; Retail investors all have this kind of investment in mind.; > Do you get the urge to gamble

No. I have hyper-focus tendencies on things that I actively participate in... things like my job (which has a stock impact), combat sport I may be focusing on at the time. 

My brain has never been good at caring about things that I don't have a direct impact on. I don't find joy predicting that someone will do well, especially when I'm not a factor in it doing well.

As others have said, find other things to occupy your mind, hopefully things that make you want to learn more skills or just work on bettering yourself. It's a similar drive of ""growth"", but more in your hands.; I have an allocation already that is for trading and such instances. Rest of my folio I don’t touch.; I have a small porfolio called LOTTO where I have max 4 pos. which are quite small, but not so small that they wouldn't matter IF they succeed. 

This is where I dump all my FOMO from the market.

Current holdings: Palantir, UIpath, asmspacemobile and immuntybii; Play with an account of 1k and try to increase it as much as possible, leave the rest in the s@p or whatever you prefer; It's ok to keep like 90% of your money in sp500 and use 5-10% for gamble up trades; 90% of my assets are in 401k, money market, 529, and HSA.  10% of my assets are in an Etrade stock account as follows:

- 1% total gamble in penny stocks or IPO crapshoots

- 5% in ""troubled"" companies having management or cash problems that I think will rebound in 5 years

- 15% in solid companies with some dividends, which I ""re-up"" sometimes when they have a bad day and go on sale.

- balance in index funds like SPY, VTI, QQQ, VTSAX, XLK

So even though 1% of my portfolio is a complete gamble, my entire portfolio is only about 10% of my assets to begin with.  If one of my penny stocks goes through the roof, I'll have a great story to tell.  If they all completely tank, I'm out $1500 total.  I just kinda like owning 200k shares of something nearly worthless ;); Controlling the urge to gamble is always going to be there. You could take a small percentage and place some bets but be careful of going down that rabbit hole too deep. Read this book ""traders traps"" this cured me of gambling too much. Also check out WSB reddit and read some loss posts. We all have that urge to hit a 10 banger. Sometimes the mkt will give us that when it sells off dramatically. Just wait for those occasions.; Yes, so i have a side acct after contributing to a regular to fulfill my itch; It's like any gambling. Don't gamble anything you aren't prepared to lose 100% of.

I have a few hundred here and there in things that I think might make huge moves someday. I'm not flipping stuff on a daily basis (unless it's a no brainer like NVDA at $105 a few weeks ago), and watching them move up and down is all the excitement I need. Like everyone else, that's RKLB for now, and that scratches the gambling itch just fine, knowing that if I lose it, oh well. It's important to remember that the $ profit isn't the goal. $500 of something isn't going to make you a millionaire - it's the excitement that's the point.; 1. You can try a paper trading account. The only danger here is if you win on your paper trading account, you might gain a lot of confidence and then be tempted to gamble with real money, and potentially lose.

2. Have a separate account you put a very limited amount into, IE $50-100 a month for stock picking, while the rest goes into an account that is well diversified.

3. Avoid options unless they are to hedge a very specific risk. Options trading is basically just gambling when used by retail investors most of the time.; Do as you do with casino gambling - allocate an amount to “play” with individual stocks. Maybe 5% of the total you plan to invest in a year. Maybe 10%. Then you can scratch that itch while leaving your nest egg to grow. 

Plus, having a budget will mean you need to wait - maybe you pick one stock that month but can only buy whatever your 10% allotment allows. Next month, you may not be so keen on buying more of that stock. Having to wait and think can keep you smart.; In my Roth I have 1 share of XDTE, QDTE, and RDTE each to give me weekly dividends.  Those dividends are the only thing I play with.  Basically it cost me about $140 and every week I get a little less than a dollar to add to my stock picks.; One way to give yourself a dopamine fix is to invest in a covered-call ETF which pays monthly. That'll give you a dopamine rush. I used to hold JEPQ but have switched to GOF. I get about $7,400 per month in distributions, but I have a legitimate need for the income.

My favorite stock for gambling used to be UNP. My portfolio was < 2% UNP. Now those funds are in GOF.; If not looking at your portfolio returns improves your mental health then you're doing it wrong. 

You have to develop the SELF DISCIPLINE to not react emotionally to your portfolio's ups and downs. Look all you want so long as you DON'T ACT on those ups and downs, especially the downs. It's OK to feel happy when your portfolio is up because you're not likely to panic sell.

That's what I've learned in40+ years of doing this.; I lose a bunch of money and the thrill fades.; You only live once!; [removed]; I actually got really into TA during the Covid crisis, most of it was interesting stuff to learn, but it wasn’t really useful. Then I learned ichimoku investing which is basically buying and selling based on the cloud that’s created by two moving averages in your stock. It makes it very easy to see what stock is breaking down and what stock is about to go up and when you should get in or out.; I can’t suppress my desire to gamble, but whenever i do, i turn my urge to buy voo, and voo only. you won’t have much chance to lose by buying voo, msft, aapl, qqq. 

it works well.; SQQQ or TQQQ on the opening

I've been timing well with bitcoins this year.; My taxable brokerage consists of basically only individual stocks. I treat investing in it exactly like gambling, which means:

1.) calculated risks (such as staying away from penny stocks), and

2.) only using disposable income, so if the stock goes to 0, then it doesn't really have a negative impact on me.; I do this because it makes investing more fun and i feel more connected investing in companies i like. Also index funds will perform the best on average, but that's an average. You'll never perform better either; Open an account at another brokerage.   Put 10k in and don't add additional.; About 10% of my investing is in individual stocks. It was a lot more when I was younger but I divested from them into index funds. That 10% is now my moon shot money, if it 5x that’s cool, if it doesn’t, it doesn’t really hurt long term that badly.; Buying individual stocks isn’t gambling if you know what you’re doing; Do it, but with small amounts. I gamble with 1% of my portfolio.; It’s easy to avoid gambling if every time you try, you lose; I treat it the same as gambling. I never put in more than a threshold I'm comfortable losing, I never chase losses, and I never delude myself that I'm somehow smart enough to know what will happen next.; Yes, but I have exactly $100 in a robinhood account that I mess with only when the urge strikes. Once it’s gone I’m not adding more.; I deal with it by compulsively buying options and telling myself ""this is the last time"". I did it for the 35th time last week. I'll do it again soon im sure.; I find it best to have a separate account for playing around with.  It's hilarious because my playing around consists of me trying desperately to meet the same gains as my set it and forget it 401k.  It's a total waste of time, but it's fun and I get my need to gamble out of my system.  I am proud to say I am actually up in my gambling account, but it would definitely be better and easier to just throw it into SPY and forget about it.; You have accumulated over 100k now, the safe way is to keep like 85% in treasury or anything that you wont touch, just add more as you work, and the other 15% you can start to think about stock picking, swing trades, and if you're doing options i think that 1% yr networth in option strategies is safe enough.; Only when I'm browsing Wallstreetbets. And I come back here to deal with it lol.; Set a budget for how much you’re willing to loose and then go play to your heart’s content strictly within that budget. Have fun!; Based on what I read, you are investing and liking it. There is absolutely nothing wrong with finding high quality, solid growth and good moat, businesses trading out of favor, adding due to some short term volatility, and waiting for a rebound confident in the fundamentals. While a lot of people say stick with indexes, I say if you enjoy investing in businesses, making money when a thesis plays out, and rinse and repeat, I say invest on. You seem to have a good head on your shoulders, so keep it measured, don’t go crazy (nio) and enjoy the journey (ups and downs, but hopefully more ups than downs); Easy.  Have two separate accounts with two separate brokerages:  One for Boglehead investing (index funds) and another for individual stocks.  The reason you use different brokerages is so that it's not easy to move money around.

My index funds make up >90% of my investments, which is a good thing because they far outperform my individual picks.  Picking individual stocks can be fun, but they're not going to consistently outperform the S&P unless you live and breathe the market.; Gamble with money you expect to lose, invest the money you expect to keep. 

I'd keep the gambling capped at like 2% so you don't eat your gains.; Would ypu eat them if thwy were already dead?; Just don't sell any of your main index funds, if you want to dabble in stocks use new money only; I keep a 80% loss stinker stock I picked once, in my account as a reminder that I shouldn’t try to pick stocks. It keeps me from doing stupid shit about 90-95% of the time…. So I guess in that respect I’m up on that pick.; Everytime I feel the need to gamble, I remember the times I loss my ass in doing so and that feeling magically disappears; I used to but picked up another hobby for that...basketball cards. Definitely more gambling and not cheap but somehow it scratches a few more itches.; [removed]; I have these thoughts from time to time, and I even have the urge to spend all my money to gamble sometimes. But just calm down and don't rush; Take 1k and trade 0dte options with it.; Gamble with sp 500 index funds; The more I have, the bigger gamble I would have to take to experience any noticeable difference in my life.   All of my basic needs (and then some) are already covered by income and the security of what I have saved.  I'm not sitting around thinking ""If I could just turn this 25k into 100k then I could buy a fancy car!""  It would have to be something like ""If I could just turn this 100k into 300k then I could pay the house off"" or ""If I could just turn this 250k into another million then I could retire tomorrow.""  I'm not risking that much.

To be clear, I do have a percentage of my portfolio in individual stocks, but I only sell a few times a year and I've rarely sold a stock after owning for less than a year.  I don't day trade.  I've been investing for about 25 years.; My method

1. Max out Roth $125 a week

2. Invest $100 a week into VTI/VXUS in my taxable account

3. Have $1000 in Robinhood to play Options. Half of any days gains goes directly into the VTI/VXUS side of things.; [removed]; You've got a slight gambling addiction. We all have some type of addiction. For me it's gaming, alcohol and adventure travel. DO NOT let your addiction dictate youR investments. Shift 5 to 10% to a dividend fund. Set dividend to dispused via check and have a blast at that casino. Differentiate the two. This is investing. Gambling is gambling. Enjoy but please be safe and put rails in place.; I don't see an issue with that. As long as you gamble with money that you can afford to lose of course. Just make sure you establish certain rules for yourself beforehand; Before Covid I never bought individual stocks. I just bought index funds and chilled, never looked at the market. Then I got addicted to stocks during the lockdowns and constantly looked at stocks. I hate it. I haven't even beaten the market. I would have been better off sticking to index funds.

I also play poker once or twice a year at a casino, I only risk $100-200 at a time. It hurts much more to lose $100 in cash playing live than it does to lose thousands from stocks online. So gambling on stocks can be very dangerous, just look at WSB.; Discipline.; 1. I remember that any time I do that I lose money.

2. If you want to track your longterm performance at ""gambling"", take a fixed (small) amount and transfer it to a different account. Pursue your strategy for some years (5?) with it. Compare your overall performance to the S&P500. Weep.

3. People pay for entertainment. Don't look for entertainment from your portfolio, or you will be paying for that entertainment.; All I like to do is the gamble; My mental health greatly improved when I stopped looking at the market constantly during work.; I've been there too. Limiting myself to 5% for fun trades keeps things in check. Less FOMO, more chill. Took up hiking to stay distracted - way better for the nerves than watching tickers all day.; put a time limit on the app!; That sounds like a smart strategy, Balancing risk while still enjoying the thrill is key. What types of stocks do you usually bet on?; I do the same - keep most in index funds but play with like 10-20% for that thrill. Scratches the itch without risking too much. Best of both worlds.; The thing is at I have been doing it for a few years and meeting or beating the market so it’s hard to stay away. It’s not like buying options and loosing 50k in one trade - I don’t do it like that. I updated the original post with more information.; > learn how you can make all the right decisions and still lose

Picard's rule of investing and life right there.; Stock gains high is a lot better for me than casino 😀. I edited my original post.; How does forcing yourself to sell if the stock drops help you focus on valuation… that’s when you double down, that means the valuation is only getting better my boy; subtle, and oh so accurate; This is what I do. I take a small amount and put it towards single stocks. The lesson I've learned is I can't pick stocks. Of the 6 stocks I've picked, 4 have dropped over 50% and one is now a penny stock. Luckily that amounts to maybe an 8k ""loss"", but it's still money I would like back.; I run $1 million portfolio in my IRA, and I have another almost as big account that is run in safe index funds; [removed]; Would you recommend those three as a good combo for a new investor long term?

So far I could find only E*Trade, which support hardware VIP token.  Vanguard’s yubikey is pointless since you can not disable sms.

Any other recommendation for an US based brokerage that support hardware based two factor authentication?

Thanks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1fy8s1x/brokerage_with_hardware_based_two_factor/,0,"Both Schwab and Fidelity also support Symantec VIP. 

Not sure if Fidelity still offers the hardware token but you can ask in r/fidelityinvestments which is the official Fidelity customer care subreddit.; Fidelity supports software 2FA with a disabled SMS option now.; IBKR has a system for hardware digital keys for large accounts with assets over 1m usd. https://www.ibkrguides.com/securelogin/sls/twofactorauth.htm; Interactive brokers; Only software based tokens, not hardware based. I did call Schwab.  Fidelity seems to be the same: https://www.fidelity.com/security/soft-tokens/overview.; It is a password less phone app, making phone pin to be a single point of failure.; Thank you; I suggest calling Schwab again.  [Here](https://intelligent.schwab.com/page/agreements/mobile-schwabsafe#:~:text=Schwab%20provides%20an%20optional%20security,at%20800%2D435%2D4000.)  Note #3 under ""How Schwab Helps Protect You"".

I have a physical token from Schwab sitting my desk right now.  A second one (my wife's) is in the desk drawer.; That's just the link for the free app.

My recollection is that you should be able to just buy the hardware token yourself on Amazon or your favorite IT distributor. I think they are about 20 bucks or so depending on the form factor that you want.; From personal experience, I have a password and software 2FA on fidelity.

You can disable the password-less option.; Hm.  Thank you.  I send them message, may be written response will be different ;).; https://www.reddit.com/r/fidelityinvestments/s/vflRWD35mv; It is $16 https://a.co/d/ibvltaB, but Schwab specifically said that that they have no support for it and don’t know if this would ever work.  Based on the fidelity representative reply, seems that fidelity is in the same boat.; VIP app does not support separate pin authentication (the way RSA soft token work), so I don’t understand how you are “disabling” this.

What I am saying, if someone get access to your phone and know your phone pin, they have full access your your brokerage account (since your password is most likely stored in password manager, protected by the same phone pin).; It is odd.  Schwab support is usually spot on.

Best of luck.; It probably depends on how it's implemented. I can't imagine that there would be an explicit distinction between hardware and software tokens. Syncing issues will probably not be supported the broker and you have to fix it yourself.

You will have to ask around to see if anyone is using the hardware token at Fidelity or Schwab.

What broker do you currently use? If it's either Schwab or Fidelity - you could just try it if a hardware token is important to you.; Dont ever save a password with a password manager.  Then you have a true 2nd factor of authentication.; Update.  My messages still not be answered, 4 days later. But I received a letter from Schwab today with a hard token which works...; I am with you, knowing a bit about technology, I don’t see a “reasonable” way to make soft and hard token separate (but then again, Symantec had number of “interesting” implementations before ;) ).  But I am not willing to use authentication when brokerage specifically says that it is not supported.; Good that you got the token.  Unfortunate about Schwab not getting this done right off the bat.

And I agree with you, this use of phones for authentication is deeply flawed.; I think that the credential ID in VIP tokens have a prefix that identifies the device type - that could be configurable. But I don't know if that's configurable or not. 

Also - since Broadcom now owns Symantec VIP - I am just guessing.; Ok, update.  Yes prefix identifies device type.  But hardware token works with both Fidelity and Schwab…; Could be.  If they would implement RCA style soft token (ie, pin protected), I would be ok with it, but token protected only by phone pin is not enough."
I wanna ask a question about options,"Okay so im new to the scene, ive been investing in stocks for the past 2 weeks.

If you had been just picking up skateboarding for the past 2 weeks, would you drop in on a 350ft half pipe today?; Options are next level. I would try your hand at investing itself for a while with buying stocks, get used to identifying good companies, and holding during volatility. Keep an eye on r/options to learn a thing or two, but you have much to learn grasshopper. And remember that about 90%+ of options expire worthless. Options are legendary mode; You can find educational resources in the wiki here:

Before you start trading options - I suggest picking up and reading at least one of the recommended books.

If you aren't willing to put in the effort to read, learn, and understand a decent book on derivatives, you aren't really serious about trading options.; You won't learn about options on reddit.

[Here is a book to get started with](https://www.amazon.com/Options-as-Strategic-Investment-Fifth-dp-0735204659/dp/0735204659/ref=dp_ob_image_bk)

Options trading by retail investors is a lot like teenage sex.  Everyone talks about it, but the people actually doing it are doing it badly.

EDIT:  There is a dedicated fiber optic cable between Chicago and New Jersey for use by professional traders.  It was laid in as straight a line as possible to reduce latency.  You cannot compete with that kind of trading.  So just buy index funds and find another hobby.; Don't, because options are more complex than 99.9% of people think. If you are not a hedge fund, don't even bother.; Leave it alone, man. In all honesty, leave it well alone. I have a banker wanker friend who is loaded, he plays with options because he can afford to and is somewhat knowledgeable. His losses always beat his wins.; Does OP understand that options trading requires prior brokerage approval?; One type of options that a lot of people talk about is selling covered calls.  Covered calls are not a way to get free money, despite what many say.

Selling covered calls is a conservative strategy that is expected to reduce both risks and returns, compared to just holding the underlying asset.  The seller will probably see lots of small wins (get the premium and keep the stock) & a few large losses (get the premium and have to sell the stock at a below market price) that will more than offset the wins.  Both strategies are likely to make money; buying & holding is likely to make more.  Check the returns of any ETF that uses this strategy & compare them to the returns of the assets they own & you'll see this.; None of your questions or considerations are the right questions so you're just not even close to ready yet. I'm not sure where to start with you, to be honest.

""Don't offer up huge profit or loss"" what does this even mean?

If you bought a call for $100 and it becomes $0 you lost all that money. If you buy a stock for $100 and it goes to $0 it's the same difference.

  
The questions you ask aren't the right ones; so what do you think you don't know and give some feedback so someone can better direct you.

Basically don't touch options till you handle that part; op has been investing for 2 wks and now wants to play options.

op belongs with the gamblers & speculators in wsb 🤷‍♂️; What about writing covered calls as an entry point to options?; No🤣; I run over 50 concurrent trades at a time and have a huge options portfolio.; Noone cares; Options in best case scenario yield about $1-2 per contract on average if filled at a good price. So in order to earn any significant amount of money you pretty much need to trade thousands of contracts per month, what is usually physically impossible to do manually without additional automation.

Also, your account is 1 hour old.; Your advice is just silly; serious people do care what other people with experience have to offer. You have no experience.; I make about $40,000 a month on my options trades. My contract sizes are in 10 - 15 contracts per lot. you simply just don't know what you're talking about.

I think it stems from the idea you think $1 is one dollar. $1 == $100 per contract. 15 contracts $1 wide is $1500. You probably thought that'd work out to $15.

Age of my account is irrelevant.; I meant $0.01 , so literally $1 per contract; Who the hell trades contracts for $0.01? That's the prices dealers give to take back contracts from losers where it's going to $0.; This is estimated as half of a bid-ask spread minus commissions. The less liquid option it, the more potential profit if buying at bid price and selling at ask price.

I feel like your next post is going to be at r/wallstreetbets if you don't stop doing what you are doing; I've been doing it for 10+ years lol. All you're doing is desperately regurgitating basics. The point is if you see a contract for $0.01 it's going to $zero.

The fact it even has a price is because usually the market maker WILL buy it back to close it off the books as THEY have to recover buying power from hundreds of thousands of such orphaned contracts.

And many $0.01 bid contracts are orphaned. It's not uncommon that I'll have 50 to 100 contracts that I can never close and have to expire worthless. Depending on the size of the underlying that could be at $0.05 or $0.01 etc.

\*edited\*; Sounds like picking pennies in front of a steamroller; How? You sell something for $1.00 and buy it back for $0.01. That's 99 pennies on the dollar. Not ""pennies""."
Is anyone else investing with Roots or have you invested in the past?,"For those unfamiliar, “Invest With Roots” is a REIT, based in Atlanta that is supposed to also benefit the renters by making them co-investors.  That concept appealed to me so I decided to try them, by investing in one unit!

I recently received a poly mail envelope with a scratch off card, a key chain, a couple of small company stickers and a post card with instructions on the scratch off and the keychain.

First of all, this is a huge turn off.  Don’t waste my money on gags and gimmicks!  I pretty much gave the company that feedback immediately.

The scratch off card was a bonus, only to be redeemed if you invested in another unit  (their nomenclature for minimum investment).  The keychain is supposed to be tapped on the back of your phone to reveal a “surprise.”  I couldn’t get it to work so I have no idea what my “surprise” is.  I’m guessing it’s like the digital business cards and just another marketing technique.

There is a high early withdrawal penalty if you withdraw your fund before a year, so I’ll most likely wait until a day after my 1 year anniversary and withdraw.

But, I’m wondering if anybody else has received some of these gimmicks, and would like to hear your thoughts or what your experience with Roots has been.  TIA!",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1fwc9fk/is_anyone_else_investing_with_roots_or_have_you/,0,"You bought a time share. A modern day version but basically a time share; Good luck! Sounds like you should've asked this question before investing with them? What made their strategy/concept appeal to you? Because their website looks pretty bogus. ; There's a lot of private REIT offerings that often label themselves as some variation of ""a unique opportunity previously only available to rich people!"" But they generally wind up being worse than a REIT and also more complex to own, are illiquid (entirely illiquid or limited opportunities to sell) and some in the past have gated withdrawals for temporary periods. 

This seems like it framed itself differently but seems very gimmicky in terms of the kind of things you got and has the same core issues (limited liquidity, etc.) Never heard of the company mentioned but crowdfunding, E-REITs (which feel like what were previously non-traded REITs - an asset class that lead to a lot of complaints over the years - in a different wrapper), stuff like that I just really don't recommend.

Edit: The site is kind of underwhelming. It focuses on the message which is nice but who is running the operation and what is their background? I see some people listed but no biography/background. It shows the number of properties it owns in Atlanta but no examples that I can see.  

Apparently this is some sort of RegA+ non-traded REIT; there's just very little information from an investment standpoint on the website, which is focused entirely on the message really. I'd have to really go through filings to try to have a better understanding of the investment (yes the message is nice but what do these houses look like? who is running this and what kind of qualifications do they have? - the CEO of this was apparently previously CEO of some sort of automotive company?), which imo shouldn't have to be done.

What are the specifics of withdrawals, given limited liquidity? Is there the ability to gate withdrawals? It doesn't really say on the website. Looking at one of the filing offerings, there's a long list of risks - including ""our manager and its affiliates have no prior experience managing a portfolio of assets to comply with REIT requirements"" and detailed conflicts of interest between the manager and the sponsor.

Edit: finally found it after looking through filings. They intend to limit the number of units to be able to be redeemed during any calendar year to 5% of the weighted average number of units outstanding during the prior year.  The manager can gate withdrawals ""at any time, without notice, for any reason or no reason."" There's a lot of other specifics, but it's like all the other non-traded REITs: yes there is quarterly liquidity, but not if a lot of people try to redeem at once.  

Again, not really familiar with this beyond just starting to look through filings, but I just think that anything investment-wise needs to have more information than this does on its website. These kinds of offerings sell themselves very basically on their websites but imo there's a lot more to it (I mean, just looking at one of the offering filings it's nearly 100 pages and there's a lot of noteworthy things/risks/considerations on these filings that should be under an FAQ section on the website itself, not something that people have to go through a filing to find) when considering this sort of investment.; The ROOTS program is aimed at a poor demographic in the Atlanta area.; I like the idea of investing in a real estate program that helps renters become homeowners, and that is what I saw during my research phase.  I do like the crowd funding concept.

I actually found some redditors that said they were getting good returns with Roots at that time.

Looked over their SEC docs, and decided to take a chance with a minimum investment.; You make a lot of excellent points!  I knew/considered some of these things when I invested, but your way of sizing up the website/investment model is very thorough and rational.

If you set up an account, you can see a bit more, photos of the houses recently purchased, and more info from the CEO, COO, …. But, I did what you did - looked at SEC filings.

So, I gave it the bare minimum investment (unit) and thought I’ll give them a year.  I invested in Zekhaus, which is a similar platform/investment model almost 10 years ago and I have doubled my money, which isn’t bad.  

I liked the uplifting renters vibe, and the rate of return other redditors said they made, but now that I’m in, I hate the gimmicks and the overall immature vibe.

So I will withdraw after my year is up!; Yes, one leg is definitely focused on renters who cannot afford home ownership.  However, the other leg is recruits outside investors to fund property acquisitions.

So the appeal is: get a good ROI (although not guaranteed) by helping that demographic.  I really like the idea, but find their recent marketing gimmicks off putting.  Third quarter returns and distributions are soon to be revealed, but even if I’m pleased with return I’ll be withdrawing after my year is up because I was so turned off by the gimmicks.; Go read their SEC filings.  The fee structure to the manager is extensive.

[**https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=0001866803**](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=0001866803); First of all, thank you for a genuinely helpful response.  However, the link you provided takes me to the SEC homepage for Roots, with a long list of documents and I’m not sure which specific document (name) you’re referring to, and I’m very interested in seeing exactly what you’re talking about.

I’ve searched for insider equity, distributions and salaries, …and haven’t seen anything.

Which stock is hidding in plain sight?,"Coming out of the Great Financial Crisis, Apple was a stock that was criminally undervalued, despite being a massive brand already. Over the years, there weren’t any groundbreaking inventions (outside of expanding their services), yet the stock still managed to significantly outperform the market. Even Warren Buffett, who bought in later, snagged it at a great valuation.

Now that the Fed seems to be normalizing rates and the economy has shown resilience, I’m thinking about which companies might be ""hiding in plain sight"" today.

A lot of people are betting on AI related plays, with many pointing to TSMC and ASML as indirect winners. I get the logic, but I believe that, no matter how successful they become, these companies will still trade at lower valuations compared to their U.S. counterparts. Money just tends to flow into U.S. equities first and foremost.

Personally, I think Meta is the best positioned among the ""Magnificent 7."" The TikTok threat has mostly passed, and it could even be a net positive for Meta not to be viewed as a monopoly anymore. Plus, I don’t think their AI and AR/VR investments are fully priced into the stock yet.

Amazon is lagging the other mega caps in terms of valuation, but there’s still some uncertainty around how well Andy Jassy will perform in the long term.

Any stocks you guys are eyeing? I’m particularly interested in established companies with consistent growth that still seem under represented.


tldr: Apple was once undervalued despite being a massive brand, and I'm wondering which companies today are in a similar position. AI stocks like TSMC/ASML seem popular, but I think Meta is well positioned due to AI/AR investments not yet fully priced in. Amazon also lags but could be worth watching under new leadership. What are your hidden gems?",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fwa7mg/which_stock_is_hidding_in_plain_sight/,612,"Two years and the Meta sentiment really has done a complete 180.

Money-making machine. Good projected growth. No debt. Just began with dividend.

 Only at 19 forward PE; CAT up over 240%; Meta looks overvalued compared to Google at this point. Google makes 2x as much money from Ads and almost 3x in revenue, and has more diversified revenue streams, than meta. Meta revenue is literally 98% from ads. Google's advertising business is 2x as big AND they have ~80B a year in revenue from non advertising sources (subscriptions + cloud which are growing much faster than Ads...), and theyre worth something like~1.25X that of Meta. I don't quite understand it tbh, metas advertising business is growing more quickly than googles but googles ad business is 2x as big and their other sources of revenue are growing just as quick if not more quickly than meta's ads.

I wouldn't be surprised though if meta passes Google in market cap by next year given how much wall street hates Google.; VRT isn’t necessarily a “hidden” gem, but it’s not become mainstream on Reddit. Their exposure to AI data centers is promising.

No joke... Any company well positioned to begin manufacturing their chips using this modern technological advancement. Navitas is currently the only pure play in this field, but any company shifting to it will do. That and silicon carbide. 

Why? All the amazing things that google, meta and the rest of the magnificent 7 are working on is truly that... Amazing. Except for the fact that these advancements have surpassed the limit in which traditional silicon chips can supply power economically. There are almost no options out there for consumers to drive the next generation of GPUs. Silicon produces too much heat and is not at all efficient at delivering power while switching at high rates. 

Gallium Nitride will be the pick and shovel industry for the next generation of technology. At a third of the size of Silicon based PSUs, GaN can provide higher throughout (3x worth) at lower heat. A smaller form factor means you can scale more in a data warehouse that is tight for space. Companies will save millions on cooling only. Electric vehicles will be able to charge in half the time or less without melting their connectors. Solar panels will be able to convert and store energy more efficiently increasing power collected and driving down cost. 

It's like the rest of the world created the fastest engines ever but the tire industry is just starting to develop the technology needed for those engines to go full speed. GaN is already showing up in many places including hundreds of smart phones and mobile charges. EVs and solar is moving towards it. 

I expect a lot of these companies to be acquired honestly but if you're excited about where GPUs and machine learning is going, keep an eye on its biggest handicap right now, and that is power consumption and our inability to deliver it.

You are probably gonna see the narrative around China change here too if the market increases further within the next couple of weeks.

“But they’re just a tiny NJ insurance company”.

It’ll make a Meta move and be at 4 trillion in 2 years watch.; Amazon - cloud is still not at its full potential and they are best placed to win; Sofi (which I'm heavily invested in) is not technically undervalued but I think currently mispriced compared to other growth stocks in its industry.

Disney I think is overvalued and has been for some time but, with recent price increases to D+ and integration of HULU, is currently mispriced (the stock) compared to peers. All the other issues that surround them are still there though.

Probably something in robotics, energy, and security... But those (a) aren't within my areas of comfort and (b) cutting edge robotics don't seem to be easily publicly investible. For example - I've wanted to invest in Boston Dynamics for years now but it's not an option. And investing in Waymo means investing in Google and everything that carries with it (as opposed to just the self-driving tech).; Eose it's all happening...; $HIMS!! I've scrolled thru quite a bit of comment here and I'm surprised I haven't seen anyone mention them. 

Look at growth for the past quarters. Up up. Just got added to S&P small cap 600! I have no doubt it'll make it's way to S&P 500; Zeta; RKLB; trust me ASTS; ASTS. Buy and hold; I'm buying Permian basin related energy companies. AI technology is here to stay and will require a lot of energy. The Permian Basin will be a critical source. Conflict in the middle east is also a factor at play too.; Sofi; Axon (the maker of Tasers). Basically a monopolist for a subscription product used by a huge amount of law enforcement offices around the world. + could be an AI play due to their cloud bodycam service.; SMCI


Had the Hindenburg report (3 months investigation) provided solid evidence, then it would be end of discussion. 

SMCI at current value is very high-risk, high-reward. If everything is overblown, SMCI is dirt cheap right now. 

Currently, there is a lot of negative (un-proven) news about SMCI and a lot of speculation.

But what we do know,

FACTS
====
> 2017 - 2018, 2019 There were account irregularities, and restatement was made, SMCI paid a penalty, CFO was replaced. 

> 2020 - 2023 No delay and compliance. New CFO.

> 2024, new Auditor (EY) + Hindenburg Short Report. Reasonable for EY wanting to double-check everything.

> DOJ probe is based on Hindenburg report... this will take years.. possibly nothing burger... or a penalty fee (Sibling self dealing, Revenue Recognition, Export control)

> In the last couple years and quarters, AI capEx are real and company like SMCI is a major benefactor. 

> AI spending is expected to continue to grow through 2025 - 2030

> SMCI has a unique approach to HPC server with components configurable and liquid cooling. Not every customer wants all the whistles & bells that competition package.

> SMCI partnership with NVIDIA is still strong. Blackwell is allocated ~20% to SMC, and customers want them.; Check out Woldspeed or WOLF!! Hit up r/wolfspeed_Stonk for more info. This company is a leader in cutting edge SiC tech, in the midst of a huge capacity build out and is being maliciously shorted. Prime time for a potential squeeze or just good old traditional upside, eventually.; RIVN; Told u SMCI bois; $SFM. Been going to Sprouts for 6 months after I just much prefer going there to a ‘normal’ grocery store. One day I was just looking up companies to realize it was actually a public company. I also started looking at the brands they carry and bought those too.

$PPC (also popular products in Costco) $PRMW, and $VITL. 

Just brands no one talks about but have been great returns. Sure some are newer than others but, not really popular by any means.; Williams Sonoma interests me. Up ~50% over the year, no debt and a few billion cash on hand, commitment to hundreds of millions in share buybacks and just raised its dividend. Well positioned to benefit from rate cuts (bc cuts = more home sales = more home good sales); Anything nuclear related. All of the big players are investing in nuclear and plan on building nuclear powered data centers.; Are you posting just so we can pick stocks for you?; Reddit... RDDT.; I happen to think BA is a good buy right now. They’re near the 52 week low & they’re too big to fail; Gmestp... It's shown countless times that $20 is a heavy resistance zone. And anytime it's hit $10 it's ran to $80 within a month or so. And it's been doing that for 3 years. But even just past few months. It's going between $20-25 consistently. At $21.50 so it's deff in the buy zone and avg down if/when it drops. Because recovery seems consistent with this one; Phillip Morris-ZYN is the new tobacco insanely addictive and cheap. It won’t be the next NVIDIA but it’s got a good run in front of it; I'm examining Uber and Tesla. Tesla has a moat from Chinese EVs in the West due to geopolitical concerns resulting in tariffs and they are the leader by far in EVs in the West and possibly the world. Check their margins; very good. They basically make the iphone of EVs. They also have FSD which is far superior to other automakers offerings.

Uber could be the biggest beneficiary of Autonomous Vehicles if more than one effective provider emerges because Uber has the consumer facing brand and network. They are also making a lot of solid partnerships with AV providers and delivery bot companies.; Clover health ($clov); AXON. Their video and data is going to be key to the future security state; Palantir. There's no question it's expensive right now, but the company is just getting started so watch for buying opportunities.; Intel

Just bought some; Rddt.. this is the most used app from me by far.. AI also using its data.; LUMN up 400% YTD and expected to keep climbing; Rycey; Still ASTS. Sorry haters. But it’s still ASTS. Do some DD. You’ll understand.; PYPL; Cost; FICO - Made me a multi millionaire.; Zoom it’s a stock that you can buy now it hasn’t left the station.

One of the best balance sheets I’ve seen and the stock price is low.

Currently it’s 68$ a share I think this gets a 40% move soon.; Can't give you an undervalued stock in an established company (the company has been around since 2017) But there is one in an emerging market (micromobility). $FLYE. 


The company ipo'd in June, is already profitable, was shorted heavily (85ish%) on no negative news/report/filing etc. (happened on July 23rd). And has failed to gain enough interest to really turn the price around since then, with one run that hit about $1.20ish.   


Price closed at $0.5758 Friday, and unfortunately they just got the notice that they need to regain compliance by March 24th, 2025 (this date may be off a little bit, but it is definitely in March 2025).  


That being said, they are an ebike/escooter/emotorcycle sales, rental, and repair company that has also branched out and started a delivery service centered in NYC.    


Why is it important that I mention NYC you might ask? Well because NYC is quite literally forcing/aggressively incentivizing micromobility & public transit adoption, actively trying to rid the city of traditional vehicles, semi-trucks and even delivery vans, now beginning to implement last-mile delivery (ebike delivery to their final destination from ""microhubs"" strategically placed throughout the city).   


But it isn't only New York that's doing this, this is a world-wide effort acrossed multiple cities and countries. USDOT themselves are backing this transition as you'll see in the links below.   


How they're doing this is too long to explain here, but links to all of the research I've posted will be below. There is plenty more to come but I haven't organized the information and posted yet. All of it is on stocktwits, seriously check the research I think you'll be surprised.

After looking through those, go dig through my stocktwits profile because there is a lot of other important information that will ultimately be added to another thread that builds on some of the info posted in the links above. 


Also, if anyone has a legitimate bear thesis after reviewing the company not based in speculation or nonsense, please comment and let it be known. Make me think.; I will say TSLA.; IonQ; AXON.  Every body cam video I've seen is from them.  I've been long for the last 5 years and think it will still break a multibagger from here.; RIVN looks exciting to me. Why is it still suffering ?; Intel; Wbd; Probably a stock no one knows about on here. 

I prefer to buy the mega caps whenever they take a hit. Scooped up more Google in the upper $140’s less than a month ago.; CCO; ANF; WPM.

Very much levered to the price of silver, but with the amount used in solar panels and most electronics and a structural deficit I can see this stock being one that we look back on in a decade and wonder why we didn't get in on it. 

The metals streaming business model is genius.; I'm betting on GM being a good choice. p/e ratio of just under 6 rn. Probably won't grow any more than it's competitors but should grow into its p/e ratio.; It's not A, B or D. It's the other one.; ASPN; BLX; Visa, recent legal trouble is like a drop in the bucket to em; Axon is my pick. Essentially has a monopoly on hardware and growth in their SAAS offering is off the charts. Massive space for further growth via new markets and due to their continued investment in the SAAS aspect of their business a guaranteed future revenue stream. Still currently underpriced imo.; FIX - Comfort Systems just has a solid history of great execution. They're one of the best positioned HVAC companies in the data center space, and they also have a great ESG/energy efficiency play with their energy management products. After a big correction at the start of September, they had a monster month on top of an already great year. One of the most beautifully consistent parabolic charts over its history.

FICO - Another long-term top performer that's had a great bull run. They're the market leader in credit scoring with a wide moat. Great financials. They're expanding into AI-based decision management solutions, making them a strong, but non-obvious, AI play.

These are I think the most likely ""forever"" stocks in my portfolio. 

Not financial advice. Do your own research.; CLOV; I don't know any at the moment, but usually the kind of stocks you're describing show up during hard times.

Examples are Tesla at $100, COIN at $30 and PLTR at $6 in Jan 2022, all companies with near-zero chance of bankruptcy yet priced as if they'd be out of business within a year or two. Unfortunately they all went down together, but it was extremely obvious at the time that these were going to at least tripple in the next couple of years.; If you believe in the idea of digital scarcity; $MSTR
Saylor is a financial wizard and is leveraging incredibly cheap and low risk loans/convertible debt to increase the BTC/per share on their balance sheet.; $DPLS; HON have been investing in them thru their DRIP program since the late 1990s.  My single largest holding outside of my 401K mutual funds.  Initially contribute $100/month moved to  $500/quarter and now nearing 7 figures.; [deleted]; $FSLR US solar play, great technology and both parties support massive tarrifs on Chinese imports. Low PE and mainly works with utility companies so not exposed directly to the consumer.; Copper. The world isnt going to stop using electricity and the global South wants to join the rest of the world and modernize. Add the fact we are moving towards renewables and need to update/replace existing grids and the compound fact that established copper producers arent exploring new sources(BHP just tried to buy Anglo American) but instead buying up smaller miners and what you have is an increase in demand without any additional supply being added. Freeport Mcmoran,  BHP, Rio Tinto, Southern Copper do your own research before buying.; Ecolab (ECL); JBLU Baby; LILM. Next generation intercity transport. The air yacht of the rich.; Reddit, in my opinion. I'm not rewriting my thesis but you can find it in my post history. So far it's done exactly what I thought it would and Q3 earnings are end of the month, we'll see if I was right or not.; Applied Materials and LAM Research; Haven't looked super deep into it but UHAL looks interesting to me.; Impinj; Palantir; Nb 1s~da; Reddit!; SMR. 

U.S. is on the verge of a major energy crisis. The growing demand that emerging tech is putting on the grid and generation is insane. It's currently not sustainable. Nuclear and renewables are the only feasible solutions while trying to curb carbon reduction. SMR is the only company whose modular reactors have initial approval from Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). UEC, CCJ, BWXT would all be other stocks to watch.; JOBY and ACHR. These 2 will be big in a few years. Don’t miss out.; I’m really hoping Bedford Metals plays out well for me. Their Uranium project seems promising.; GOOGLE AND MICROSOFT BABY; I think you're right about META... they really are monetizing AI and have new apps coming out all the time.

The latest is their META Movie Gen.; The one im about to sell; $LIF has been on a tear since their US IPO in June.; Zevra. Their product just got FDA approved and has potential of earning them a billion in revenue. They’re currently going strong with a yearly revenue of like 10 mil. Im not seeing something or it’s a gold mine in plain sight; $IOT; MSTR; Intel and Ubisoft. What comes down can only go up. Or go even more down; My main is Arbor Realty Trust. PE of 10.4 and since it pays regular dividends and is a somewhat smaller company, it tends to get overlooked. 

It is not one to be likely to explode in value at any point IMO but is definitely a company to have in a portfolio if you want reliable constant growth.; MESO; I'll bite on a sector / subset of publics that isn't one of the single sentence answers permeating this thread - pureplay natural gas E&Ps .

and probably midstream publics with an asset portfolio that skews nat gas, like KMI or WMB; same goes for public MLPs if you're banking on corporate tax rates to go back up ~35%.

Mid-term macro forecast is favorable with (1) a number of LNG liquification projects coming online and finally moving volumes, (2) obvious demand pull from AI-driven / datacenter demand, (3) a good number of gas midstream infrastructure comes online (and also begin moving volumes) over the next few years as well.

Most of these guys trade at (rough estimate) 1.5xish to NTM FCF or so, generally?

Also most have pretty strong cash yield (in addition to a pretty cheap price)

Examples of E&Ps include (off the top of my head) : CHK, AR, EQT, RRC

Midstream / MLPs (also off the top of my head): KMI, WMB, ET, EPD, OKE; Nvidia? Lol.. I know what you’re thinking. Overvalued right? My horse, nonetheless.; RKLB; It is soon becoming obvious that uranium is the new cheap and best source of energy to sustain the ai surge. I am currently holding UEC but soon will get into more uranium stocks; Ford.
Usually dips this time of year. 

Hidden gem. 

Pays divs ; I will say it again intuitive surgical. The king of robotic surgery.; SWTX bio pharma with global expansion and new product launch. Bargain.; None of them.

Anything that’s an opportunity in the stock market will be bought up, until it is overbought, by “big money”.

Rather than trying to beat high finance at their own game (with Reddit advice, no less), you should be diversifying with broad market ETFs, AND diversifying into blue-chip bonds and government debt.

With interest rates falling, there’s an opportunity to make money on bonds, as bond prices in the secondary market move inversely to interest rates.  As in, when  interest rates rise, bonds increase in value, due to the concept called “Premium Bonds”.  You can find resources that describe this.; Amazon is clearly undervalued. It should be in the 220’s.; MVIS imo; $hiti  

https://x.com/mvcinvesting/status/1830697874683842812?s=46&t=isMGSgAwakVgWTVa3jibrA; Buy BRK.B JPM and AMZN. There’s nothing else to buy unless you want to touch china.; High yield ETFs crashed extremely hard but their yields stayed somewhat high. Yields went up to previous levels pretty quickly. Prices recovered when people realized this. You could have bought and gotten like 16%+ yield on cost.; BRK.B, just look at their growth over the last few years. It's gained over $100 in value this year and at its current rate will quickly catch up to its older sibling BRK.A in about a decade as long as Buffet and his successor keep with the current policy of not performing any stock splits; WCN, WM, FHH, TTE, ROG, ADM, UNA; chinese stocks: tencent, alibaba, jd, bidu. all grossly undervalued and is now in the early innings of a bull run; MSTR: if you’re bullish on btc you have to buy microstrategy solely because they own over 1% of the supply.

CRSP: systems already widely used across the medical field but they have just begun to develop their own drugs. 

PFE: sticking in healthcare, high dividend, extremely strong reputation, large cash position, 1/3 the mcap of novo, 1/5 cap of lly

Those are my screaming buys for the well known stocks.

Here’s an unknown tech gem, BAND: fantastic exec team and BOD, client list includes Microsoft, google, cisco, zoom, etc. mcap of $500M, was once as high as almost 5 billion.; Google; Intel; A sell at $89, a buy at $596.; Metaverse, whatever happened there ; I bought at the biggest dip. Meta owns WhatsApp which is communication, that’s shit wasn’t going anywhere. Turned $1000 into $12000; Or the fact they are one of the top AI companies, and leading the open source side of things. And AR glasses + AI are a match made in heaven. Not sure how much of that was planning or just luck for AI to explode and evolve when it did. And their PE ratio is still low compared to its peers (same with Google). And if for some reason AI and/or AR don't work out, they are still a massive social media company which basically prints ad money at huge margins. At their current valuation they could put out gigantic dividend yields if the money spent on research was diverted to shareholders.; Bought at $105ish... The valuation a couple years ago was insane and it was an easy turnaround play.; It sure does, LOL; Well he did change https://imgur.com/a/80OW0lK; Good point. Not a company you think of unless you need paint… and everyone needs paint at some point.; But at a pe of nearly 40 and an expected growth of earnings of 8% this company is quite expensive - i am a little bit sceptical. But i would be happy if you could convince me that this stock is a good investment; i feel like auto zone is another random company that's done good too; PPG's fundamentals are better than Shewin's by a fair amount. Nothing in plain sight here at all.

Also, PPG is doing buybacks atm, all the more reason to think it's undervalued.; I remember working there and later finding out about their stock price and it was a holy shit moment. They can run a business I guess. Feels really scammy in some ways; their paint is probably some of the best, but they can make a gallon of paint for like $10 and turn around and sell it for $70 and no one bats an eye when the price goes up $2-5 dollars year after year. Just offer a 30% off sale every month. Give the contractors some ridiculously good deals, still make a profit when some people can get a $60 gallon for $15. Have their own massive distribution system.; Apple was at 10 P/E in 2016; Revenue highly dependent on ads, lawsuit pending with DOJ. I think the discount currently is justified.; Short term the money printing machine will continue. 

But long term it seems that search is not going to be how we interact with the internet anymore. And that is really their cash cow. When LLMs replace this market, google will undoubtedly be a player, but they won’t have a monopoly like they have now. 

It’s also less obvious how to print money from an LLM based solution with multiple competitors. There will certainly be AI based products and markets that we can’t predict now, but it’s not clear google is best poised to win in this space.; Yes, but their milk cow is still the same after 20 years and YT is not looking good from the consumer's perspective. I feel like they are becoming a worse company overall.

I sold my google stocks a couple weeks ago. It was a good return tho; I WISH I had some capital for long term investment. Look at Meta 2 years ago and it just 6x your money. Ridiculous. I would instantly put 30-50% in Google.; I need more GOOG. I have only 45 shares but I need to get to 100; Google search is borderline useless now.  They've become what they replaced, a bloated mess of ads and nonsense websites; I saw this but they aren't exactly hiding anymore with their move in the last couple of years.; Googles market cap also does not price in 

GEMINI revenue, WAYMO, TPUs; I don’t think Metas business model is as threatened by the chatgpt model. Google is competing and will need to likely make bigger changes than meh AI answers at the top of the search page. (Long term).; Not to mention google isn’t as a corrupt of a company which if everyone stops overlooking for meta will hopefully come back to nite them; VRT basically follows NVDA; I’m so glad I read these kinds of threads cause that’s how I found out about VRT 2 years ago.  Still couldn’t give you an explanation of what the company is. But it looks like a “the modern world needs this or else” type of deal.; When I do work in a data center, Vertiv is everywhere. How well they do is directly related to how many data centers companies are building. As long as people are building them, I'm bull-ish.; Beat me to it. Google could be the biggest company in the world in the coming years if they nail the projects they’re currently working on.; My fear with Google is just that it’s the only one out of the mega cap tech companies that is facing serious regulatory challenges by the DOJ.; [deleted]; Why?; Go to Finviz, key in your criteria, sort by mkt cap. Done!

[Stock Screener - Overview  PEu25 Growtho25 o10 SortBymarketcap (finviz.com)](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&f=fa_debteq_u0.5,fa_pe_u25,fa_roe_o25,fa_salesqoq_o10&ft=2&o=-marketcap); Yea. I am surprised Mag 7 is upvoted to the top. They dont seem hidden in plain sight. They are upvoted to the top of just about every thread on sub. 

I think FICO and AZO are better answers.; Good answer.  Hard predicting the future with such clear accuracy so far into the future.  As a story unfolds it becomes more clear.  You have to watch the things you know closely for opportunities.; Meta is overbought now; BABA; What else in LLY pipeline do you like?   I feel like there are about to be about a dozen GLP-1 agonist competitors.  

Personally, I'm more interested in VRTX long term because of their opiate alternatives and CRISPR technology.    But, I haven't really analyzed or invested in either stock.; Insurances are all choosing to not cover it for obesity.; For obesity stuff, I threw some cash at alt. They claim weight loss while also improving liver function and making liver less fatty. Phase 3 trials are 2025 I think. Definately not an expert on the company, but worth looking in to; LMT is my #2 position behind GOOGL. I think Russia and Iran are increasing worldwide demand for weapons and it's not going to stop.; The war machine prints but how do we know which company specifically? Boeing is also a major defence contractor. Huntingdon Ingalls is critically important to US shipbuilding yet they haven’t done well either.; These threads are about naming stuff with positive sentiment. Mag 7 has positive sentiment so they get upvoted to the top. 

I tried and I named FICO earlier in this thread and got no upvotes. Likely because it fits the answer so hidden in plain sight people dont appreciate the answer. Not much you can do if you actually name a real hidden in plain sight stock.; AMZN hasn't made a real new high since late 2021. All the others have at least broke out like AAPL and GOOG did. Consumer discretionary does the best after rate cuts start. So my very is that AMZN is going to have a crazy run up soon.; same. i scoffed once i started reading.

OP thinks a Mag 7 stock that has already climbed up 500% from its lows is ""hiding in plain sight."" lol..... 

had to make sure i was in the right subreddit because this level of stupidity should be reserved for WSB; > for the next generation of technology

Gallium Nitride might destroy itself, by powering AI that exponentially improves material science leading to better alternatives!    
Whatever you think of the AI hype, things like drug discovery and material science are rapidly speeding up; This is the first time I’ve heard of this company and interested to start looking more into it. Do you know why it has been nothing but declining since the end of 2023?; i came here to also spread the good word for U; grandma?; Google employees wearing crocs; Sorry for asking, but since when is PE of 24 literally free money?; It’s got electrolytes; Ehh, I'm bullish on RKLB long term but not only because of Neutron (which will take years to perfect/commercialize beyond the initial launches), but because of their growth in space systems, which is the real money maker for RocketLab. I personally feel too many are investing based on Neutron's planned launch next year, but it's space and shit blows up and gets delayed all the time. Profitability likely 2027/2028, *maybe* 2026 if everything goes as planned; Amazed how rarely it’s mentioned on reddit. Even with the huge moves this week, nary a peep; that is one volatile stock, haha; I second this; It's about to get *very* crowded in this space (no pun intended) and ASTS is only one aspect -- satellite manufacturer for LEO D2D service? IDK maybe I'm missing something and there's more potential here, but I'd like to see more diversification before tossing my hat in on the stock; The goat Cartman; I’ve been doing 30 day calls on WMT since they split and cashing out and rebuying — probably have done that about 4 times now and have tripled my money.  They’re on a steady escalator up.; They are pouring a lot of money into their new tech arm. Walmart digital services. However I think this is the second time they've made a run at a digital services business. They tried health care and it didn't work out, but this latest initiative seems to have a lot of meat behind it.; I love massive racks; VRT to 150!!!; Valuation is nuts tho!!! Trades like a tech company; I bought at a bit over 500 and was certain I had missed the boat. Glad I held.; According to Reddit it was a 100% sell a few years ago at $7 and now it’s a massive buy at $40. Buy high sell low isn’t just WSB it seems; 100% agree with PLTR; Curious why; Solid pick and most won’t understand. Which only draws me in further.; It’s had a great run I wouldn’t say it’s a buy now I would sell.; Their new ad placement  has me accidentally  clicking on so many ads. Bullish because of that alone. Also their adds are way more disguised as posts now so people falling for it even more.; Their ads don't convert , so digital advertisers rarely advertise on it. (You can't even target subreddits.) Their targeting and capabilities suck so they won't  beat meta or tiktok. They allow non authenticated users to post, read and consume, so you have no idea who you are targeting. 

So unless they can monetize a different way, it's not going to take market share anytime soon.; >The information on this site is incredibly valuable

How? Anyone can just crawl it.; Yes. 100% agree. Just in the past six months I have heard from several people that Reddit always shows up in Google and they need to start using it because everybody is using it. Been here a minute and my wife just signed up because all of her friends are on it. 

Combine that with an international use case and more details about AI training and I think there is the potential for some great, great upswings. My bare minimum valuation is that it is worth AT LEAST  a Twitter before Elon bought it for too much. 

They HAVE the attention. They just need to better squeeze money out of it.; INTC will explode to near $100 in 3-4y; what's the discount rate in 10 years?; operating income is negative lol; Why would they be worth so much in 10 years tho? People compare to SpaceX, but it cannot be worth as much without SpaceX disappearing; I’ll have whatever you’re smoking m8; Looking around that price point as well to buy more. I don't see a future with naturally skinny Americans lol.. people will be on ozempic and it's improvements for decades to come; I sold mine a few weeks ago because I hold it in some etfs and put it in NVDA. Wish I hadn’t.; Can you explain to me what PLTR does and why it’s a good investment ?; I own Coinbase but I often wonder how strong is their moat? If Schwab or Fidelity or other big players all started offering crypto trading, what would be COIN’s competitive edge?; coinbase will pump with btc - just watch its ranking as it moves up the most downloaded app list. around the next ath if it moves up anywhere near thdd red top 10 …. that’s when you sell and take some off the table; Maybe I'm just overly cynical because I'm a fan of games, but it feels like most of the big game companies are churning out garbage and horribly annoying their playerbase. If the world ever runs out of rubes, they'll be in trouble. (Lol.); They are looking to go private; About to bust a move.; What about when boomers and silent generation start dying?; I was considering buying Paypal stock, but concerned about competitors such as Apple Pay, etc. I feel like Paypal’s portion of the market share will be eaten up by competitors. I might be wrong, but something that makes me hesitant to buy.; How? AMD seems to be far more competitive and go-to choice for customers; You must be the guy who invested his entire inheritance from granny on Intel 😂; Yeah F is so cheap lol; I just sold all my Ford stock... and bought an F250 with the proceeds lol. I bought F when they announced the F150 Lightning but sold when the EV excitement dwindled and actually a lot of Ford vehicles are having a lot of problems. Made about 50% on the stock but I could have made 300% if I had exited sooner. Bought at $8 sold at $12.; Came here to say this; u/bnjmnzs Constellation has been on fire lately! 🔥 As the bullish nuclear trend continues...they'll likely continue to benefit as well as the nuclear fuel cycle (uranium in particular). FYI there's some good due diligence at [https://uraniumcatalysts.com](https://uraniumcatalysts.com/) .; People don't even mention BWXTs role in all this.; Yep. OP trying hardest to get stock picks outside of Mag 7, index funds, and ETFs. They clearly named 3 out of the 7 Mag 7 in OP. But top response still one of the stocks they mentioned lol.; Yes that’s always the case with these; They’ve been failing almost weekly all year…; I was going to mention the same thing. Plus they have IQOS which is being launched in the US. I remember an investor day presentation from last year - one page was showing products and time to get to $10b revenue. IQOS was first to reach compared to FB and Google. It was pretty impressive :); What is the story on CLOV? What is making their sudden gains these few days?; RIP Nana; My gains are crushing these downvotes. Bears don’t like money; I love their design and concept for future smaller vehicles, but they burned $5B in the past 12 months and only have about $5B left in the bank.

I think they have another $4B on the way from VW, but they could realistically be 2-3 years from bankruptcy.; Cause it’s a car company?

I put $4000 in when the average was $135ish and I'm barely at $12,000...; Having used their AI services, they have a long way to go before they can claim any sort of victory. Even their basic AI search on their app is absolutely horrible.; I was buying around those levels but sold at 420 🥴; That’s a good paint; It’s priced in at  $3,000 how is it hiding in plain site 😅; I do not like AutoZone. The quality of their parts (and many others in the industry) has significantly declined post-Covid. They’re also geared towards retail DIYers rather than larger commercial accounts. A lot less people will have the ability to work on their own vehicles because of how advanced some vehicles have become. I think in 10ish years AZ will be much less profitable. They’re dumping a ton of money into trying to build up their commercial lines, but Duralast has become known as DontLast. I haven’t looked into their technicals in terms of investing, but I work in the auto repair industry and just don’t like their future outlook from an insiders perspective.; It was priced to shrink, and I was glad for the opportunity to buy.; And since then made roughly 10x. Of Google can do half of that, I'll be happy.; revenue highly dependent on ads … is that supposed to be bearish?; The thing is that Google never made money on the kinds of answers that LLMs provide. The bulk of their ad revenue comes from people searching for a nearby landscaping service, a particular brand of clothing, a nearby Indian restaurant and stuff like that. AI isn't going to change that business model because LLMs aren't going to answer those kind of questions.; My recent surprise that I stumbled on is Howmet (HWM) a strong 60+% climb in value over this summer; Actually, Google is punished in a sense for even having Waymo and other bets as it makes their profitability appear worse than it would be otherwise... Which is currently being used as one justification for the lower multiple.; I'd be very surprised of Google is even making any money off of Gemini. Pretty much everyone is probably bleeding money on AI chatbots/etc. at this point.

The goal for now in that market is to capture market share, profits come later.; The thing is, all the current AI models use the transformer architecture that Google literally invented. So any competitive product will just be copied by Google who can leverage it better with first mover advantage and wayyyy more brand recognition for search. And if they want to get into a patent/trademark fight Google has a huge advantage; This narrative makes no sense, sorry. Firstly, chat gpt is orthogonal to search - they're different products, with different markets and different use cases/user journeys. They solve different problems.

Secondly, googles search query traffic is about 50,000 queries per second (and growing quickly). It would currently be way, way, WAY too expensive to scale LLMs to handle this. Chat gpt let's paying users do like what, 20 queries a week? And their user base is tiny. To suggest that chat gpt has the infrastructure to even become a legitime competitor to Google is pretty ridiculous right now. Maybe when they stop rate limiting their user base that idea could have *some* merit, but I don't see that happening anytime soon.

Even with the compute and inference costs decreasing exponentially, to even SUGGEST that any LLM is CLOSE right now to being able to handle 50k queries per second is pretty laughable - and even if it were realistic, chatbots are not reliable sources of information... So they need to be supplemented with Google or something similar. Not to mention that Googles core business and search traffic are growing, so that 50k number is a moving target, and could easily be 100k in 5 years (given the secular trend of smartphone adoption in the developing world... Which is dominated by Android. Remind me who owns Android again?).

There is no evidence that chat gpt is threatening search as far as I'm aware. Search query traffic and revenue are accelerating QoQ/YoY.; CLS is a good alternative to VRT for those who feel as though they might have missed the boat on VRT. 

Better PE ratio, net income and opportunity for price growth, IMO; I like them both, however CLS is Canadian with its supply chain electronics manufacturing services company headquartered in Toronto. It started as a subsidiary of IBM in 1994.; I'll bite; what is VRT? Genuine question here.; They do cooling and secure power solutions. Basically the keep those high end CPUs and GPUs nice and cool while they are running. As well as keeping the power on if there is a blip in power. Like an APC power backups; What's the actual name of this company?; That’s a big if (but agreed); Which Google projects are you excited about?; That's always been the same Google though.  Always looking like they're about to take over the world and you just stop hearing about the stuff.; People have been saying that about Google for the last decade lol; I could also be the biggest company in the world if I just start - similar magnitude #IF; rulxoysp; If Google breaks up the shares just become more valuable; You can bet on Google or bet on the regulator. Given the state of government today, I’m betting on Google; Sounds like a good dip to buy then; Those actions rarely kill the value..  it's only going to slow it down,  or divide it and speed things up.; The sum of the parts is actually worth more imo. I own Alphabet and am convinced that if they were broken up, they would be worth more. YouTube, search, self driving, Gemini, how many other divisions exist.; This is a fear, not an insight.; It will take around 10 years for that case to be ruled upon in Court if it even gets that far. Google has the best Lawyers & Lawyers are great at delaying cases; Hard agree with all of this despite me being bullish. For what it's worth, the reason why I agree is the reason why I can't legally explain why I agree.; Also from a consumer perspective my god have the products hit the fucking shitter these past 4 years. GCP and oddly enough Google Fi are the only products that I haven't had a bad experience with in the past few years.; I regularly read the Computer Science career subreddits, and the prevailing sentiment is it's a total disorganized shitshow at Google. I've seen several people recommend not to apply at Google.; First reason - PE 24

Then, a massive cash pile (invested in treasuries), earning cool 4-5%, poised to grow even more as rate cuts come along.

When they're not acquiring smaller competitors, they're spending this cash for $70B buyback.

So, just from balance-sheet angle, it's all beautiful, even if someone doesn't understand/believe in their sweet spot in tech marketplace.; Youtube will take over entertainment. In the future - there will be many many small time operations creating entire series on youtube with AI play.

This is 1/20 reasons, there's so many; SMCI is in the list!   
I don't trust it; Other than Google I don't recognise a single name.; FICO and AZO are absolute beasts. Not sure they are hiding in plain sight though - I’d assume that means undervalued and going to deliver huge returns; Speaking of hiding and Mag7 ... TSLA dropped out and AVGO/Broadcom replaced them, which hasn't gotten much notice; Could be! But only with a change in Chinese leadership where they would, you know, honor the rule of law and not throw the CEO in jail for a year because he said something displeasing to or about them.; I like their retatrutide. It’s the triple action version of Moujnaro and Ozempic that’s currently in late trials. from what i noticed, only when Novo and LLY have shortages , other companies can produce and sell their GLP-1. LLy is cracking down hard on those weight loss spas. Again, both of those companies patents expire in late 2020s early 2030s. By then, they will have even better weight loss drugs. But who knows what happens in the future. 

I haven’t done my research on VRTX, but from what I heard about CRISPR. It should be a hot buy.; How do you find a entry point when it's already up...

Thanks 🙏; Well, look at who makes the most in-demand weapon systems and platforms among US and allies. LMT is in quite the position with their missile programs, F-35, and more. Anyone putting in serious bids on upcoming contracts may also be a good bet. NOC, GD, etc.; It was a SPAC (special purpose acquisition company) where a pool of investors set out to find a company they thought could succeed with a large infusion of cash. They settled on what now is Navitas as the technology was just starting to be integrated commercially. The infusion was something over a billion dollars initially so they were cash rich. The officers of the company chose deferred shares as salary too to minimize the hit on cash reserves. 

They had been growing some 60-70% YoY which kept the high valuation going. But this year, markets slowed and chip manufactures got hit hard, so they stalled on revenue growth adding concerns for a dilution in the short term. 

That seems possible for navitas but next year and forward is looking completely different. Since it's new tech, they are inventing and innovating on the fly so it takes some time to deliver design wins (like a year or two). Starting late this year and forward a lot of those design wins are coming to fruition. they are beginning their deliveries to AWS and Google data warehouses, converters to solar (which was hit hard but on the up and up now), and more residential power devices like fridges, kitchen gadgets and laptop chargers. 

Whoever has the best IP here will be set up for the future. Looking forward to getting back to the 50-60% YoY growth. 

Also much of Europe is starting to go solar and electric. The demand will be high for equipment that can provide the best power.; You provide his point; What about those little things that go in Croc holes.; [deleted]; It’s what plants crave.; 3rds it. This is it.; Something something gold rush sell shovels; worse. at one point in the last month or two it was priced more richly then $NVDA is...; Yeah a lot of these stocks people are mentioning here have had recent great runs. I remember thinking Meta was a buy when it crashed a while back and everyone was talking about selling it. People are talking about buying space companies, semiconductor companies after crazy high runs. Just going to sit back and wait for things to fall. A recession is around the corner anyhow.; It's the software for all kinds of hardware out there. Like NVDA is the hardware for all the software out there. They are both respective in their nature. Just my 2 cents.; Yeah not time to load up now, wait for a pullback to low 30s; Exactly why it’s undervalued..; Should be easy to target subreddits though, no?

Its actually around where other car companies are at.; They’re a health is a medicare company that is converting into more of a SaaS company with an AI model that helps with expediting the diagnosis process for patients. It’s been beaten into the ground (as you can tell). They have star ratings for medicare companies coming out soon and I believe that could be a contributing factor to the recent gains.; Everyone I know uses IG though and WhatsApp is almost exclusively used for text correspondence in many foreign countries. People zero in on Facebook and forget about the rest of meta’s extensive portfolio.; The sacred and the propane; I’ll tell you what fuckin happened: that piece of shit Zuckerberg put 6 billion into the metaverse without any thought and tanked the stock.; Always a shame when they go young like that ; Teach AI real conversations; Massive strategic asset with a shitload of leverage on governement; I bought Oct 3rd, 6 shares at $138
Then I bought 17 shares at $88/share  In November

So I spent $2000 total not $1000 the 17 shares is roughly $1500. was using rough estimations, for the 17 shares I’ve made $10,000

I literally got it at the dip. I’m not sure how I got it at $88, but I guess the demand for Facebook stock was so low I got it at a discount since so many people were selling, I could send a screenshot if you don’t believe, I’m just lazy; Meta.ai imagine feature (creating ai images) is pretty wild. Changes in real time as you type and gives multiple results when you hit done.

Really fun tool to use ; I used their AI tool to practice for a job interview (it's been 12 years since my last interview). At the very least it helped me dust off some skills and presented some questions I hadn't considered. Not quite revolutionary, but I'd definitely use it again if I was preparing for another one.; Use meta.ai, it is pretty decent & we are internally fine tuning 🦙those models are pretty good. Btw they have one of the largest GPU clusters + are the primary contributors to pytorch which is the main library for training ML/LLM models.; Ditto around $500 as valuation no longer juicy. Still have some but on house money and just holding.; Lmao unless we somehow regulate it enough the future consists of ads in the nighttime sky; It might take a while but I think ultimately they will. I think we’re moving to a world where we all have AI assistants that handle these logistics. I don’t have much confidence in a timeline prediction there but I think that’s where we’re heading. Wouldn’t surprise me at all if thats in 10 years or less; I also found them, I literally have no clue where i saw them at, bought at $81 per share and now at a %26 increase; People talk about Tesla self driving and Uber “what if they didn’t have drivers”

Google is literally ahead of both of them by miles with Waymo, they’re already operational in several cities, and Uber is licensing waymo to test it out….; [deleted]; ""The goal for now in that market is to capture market share, profits come later.""

This has been the driving factor for all tech stocks since 2010 pretty much.

You get a much better stock return by driving insane user acquisition & growth, and then trying to capture profit from those users later.; Downvoters are just angry that Google is far and away the most popular product in human history ... And growing.

Sorry haters, chat gpt ain't replacing search anytime soon or ever.; RemindMe! 5 years 

ChatGPT pro is not limited to 20 queries a week lol, that’s just literally wrong. I probably do 100+ queries per day and don’t ever bump into usage limits. 

You are of course correct that current day models with current day compute resources cannot replace search today. 

But why would you assume that the models and compute won’t continue to scale and increase? Just look at how much it has changed in the last 2 years. With hundreds of billions of dollars pouring into this, and insanely fast progress, you can’t see a world where LLMs become a better way to interact with the internet than search? 

FWIW my wife, very much not a tech person, already uses ChatGPT more than google search.; Glorified HVAC company. Nothing they’re doing can’t be done by someone else.; Vertiv Holding Co.; Not with the current leadership. I think they're too comfortable with the current state of things.; With their current culture it's a huge if; Isn't there also the possibility that Google will lose share in search?; Tensor processing units for Data center memory processing

I also believe Alphabet and Microsoft (but more likely alphabet) will create software to complete against palantirs Apollo; Waymo; I mean, I remember when they bought YouTube for what, 5m? I thought that was the biggest waste of money ever.

Years later and I still live in my mom's basement for some reason.; Why would they; They can slow you down. But they can't stop you. ~Ramesh; Google Cloud! Arguably the most important one for the future; What's wrong with smci? Never heard of them; Bcoz it's quite rare now to find a company with growing revenue , high RoE, low debt and low PE. So you only find small caps, micro caps, besides Goog.


If you're willing to pay more PE, then choices get wider.; Russia is run by evil dictators    
China is run by soulless economists    


They know that fucking over foreign investors has massive massive risks that could damage their economy for 50 years   
Kidnapping Jack Ma didn't really have any downsides; I bought some NVTS when it dipped. I have 1200 shares with a cost basis of $2.49. I’m really hopeful they will be a good investment in a few years. I’m not buying anymore, just holding what I got and waiting  patiently to see what happens.; Clearly an individual of your discerning tastes could only be speaking of toe charms

https://amzn.to/3Nbg8wC; the croc charms that they sell are an insane profit for crox...holy shit. those tiny little pieces of rubber/plastic are selling for like $3-5? absurd.

My only concern with something like $CROX is that it is a company that is reliant on fashion trends going its way, which is never guaranteed.; do you know other tickers similar to VRT?; Rocketlab isn’t American though is it?; Very allegorical; Actually he spend > 40 BILLION ON THE FKIN METAVERSE lol; And now it's at $600 a share; My estimation of Mark Zuckerberg as a man just fucking plummeted.; Lol. It was all a front to get a head start in AR. All that money is going into real R&D like the Orion project.; Is it free?; Yeah I sold my measley 10 shares but then weeks later bought another 4. I'll just keep these for a while; Fed to your eyes directly via Google glass.


Please maintain eye contact with glass and complete the ad prior to further use; With a ChatGPT Plus or Team account, you have access to 50 messages a week with OpenAI o1-preview and 50 messages a day with OpenAI o1-mini to start. 

When you hit that limit, you'll see the following pop-up and no longer be able to select the model from the drop-down menu.

From the open AI website.



I actually did mention that the cost of compute And inference is decreasing exponentially, but Google search query traffic is also growing, it's a moving target. And as you can see above, the best models (which are still really bad and hallucinate often) such as o1 ARE rate limited despite a tiny user base. So yea the cost of compute has gone down but serving SOTA models is always going to be drastically more expensive than answering queries in the way Google does it.

And no I don't see how an LLM becomes a better way to interact with search. They're fundamentally unreliable and slow.

By the way, LLM cannot *interact with the internet* by itself ... It needs to be integrated with another app to do that such as a search engine.

Good for your wife I guess? A sample of n=1 isn't convincing, have you seen search query traffic and revenue growth since chatbot was released? Reality tells a different story.; True, I buy the dip but sell it soon after a run up, Plenty of competition, no ip to secure the moat; This is wrong. They do high end cooling for data centers and secure power solutions. They are definitely the leader in cooling after they bought leibert. I’m no vertiv fanboy. They are my biggest competition lol; This was what I said. They bought liebert in 2016, which is 10 years after the HVAC largely moved on from liebert CRAC units for japanese competition. Japanese products are cheaper and more robust. I understand the ai tag is where the valuation comes from, but all the other HVAC manufacturers trade at half or worse the valuation of vrt.; Thank you.; Maybe I’m a pessimist but I feel like fully autonomous driving is a way more difficult problem than we thought 5 years ago.

I sold it on apple news bought it back on GPU buying spree and ai. Its my top position average 200$

Regret bot buying Nvidia though.. biggest mistake i sold that around 300(after buying at 120) before the stock split


Current buy google..its fwd pe is just 20..has some room; If you have fb messenger, you can use the tool there! ; Yes; I take one multiple times a week. The hype is real. It works incredibly well.; Waymo is doing it today.  The unknown is how well they scale to new areas as it becomes legal/they get permitted for them.; More like fully autonomous lawyers...; When it gets here, and it will, it won't be going away; It seems to be working in LA, San Fran (?), and Phoenix. Could see it replacing manned Ubers and Taxis in most major cities within 5-10 years.; That's if it can be profitable on it's own. We know how much revenue YouTube generates, but revenues aren't profit. And IMO the fact that Google doesn't share the profit numbers means that they're nowhere near as good as most people at reddit seem to think.

IMO YouTube is probably profitable, but only just barely. I'd be shocked if they had more then a 10% profit margin, IMO it's probably more in the 5% range. There's a ton of costs involved in the business, like the absurd amount of videos they have to have stored, with endless amounts of content constantly being uploaded every day, the vast majority of which don't ever make enough money to pay for their storage costs and other expenses.; What's wrong with them?

I've no idea. I'm just tryna learn; Oof. To say the least; Good points. But also I think the investment of being the king of user submitted content might pay off soon. A lot of people (like me) are probably sick of the ad experience and considering paying for premium. It’s not like we have somewhere else to turn. It feels like I’m a frog getting boiled slowly with the ads lately.; For information, you should use Google or ChatGPT; Not you, that's for sure"

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Hopefully it maintains this strength when market opens.; Jesus what happened in that jobs report thread lol; Earlier this year, I [commented on the bankruptcy risk of Spirit airlines](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/197ztxn/rstocks_daily_discussion_technicals_tuesday_jan/ki6nmc3/) and why the [judge should not have blocked the buyout by JetBlue](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1av3jt4/capital_one_is_buying_discover_in_a_353_billion/kr8ulgr/) back in January.

The judge wrote: 

> ""The government has demonstrated that consumers value Spirit flights as a unique, economical product option,"" Young wrote. ""The removal of Spirit as an option for consumers, therefore, would constitute a cognizable harm.""""

[...]

> “Spirit is a small airline. But there are those who love it. To those dedicated customers of Spirit, this one’s for you. Why? Because the Clayton Act, a 109-year-old statute requires this result — a statute that continues to deliver for the American people.”

Today Spirit Airlines is in discussions for bankruptcy. Another example why being reflexively anti-M&A isn't always 'pro-consumer' let alone pro-competition. And an example of the danger of those binary event-driven situations where a single judge can mess up an otherwise very compelling thesis.; The US economy added 254,000 jobs in September. That’s way above expectations and a nice bounce from 159,000 in August. (Both July & August revised up)

Unemployment rate: 4.1%. (Down from 4.2% in August)

Wages: +4% in past year; It's amazing to see cyclical stocks and cyclical natural gas plays just play the same old tune every year. 

Right now nat gas is acting the very same it was in 2023 at this exact same time (storage) with the exact same price and I watch the shares of my nat gas stocks peak around the end of october, sell, buy lower but not as low the previous year, rinse, repeat, rinse, repeat.  Stock top using technical analysis (oh god really?!?  isn't that voodoo?) and see it clearly as a politicians lies.

The thing is when will the price just not drop as much or stay elevated?  While I am bullish on long term natural gas one needs to be a bit more reasonable and understand it won't be in the next few years but nat gas is certainly ramping up demand wise.  Bearishness on oil is bullish for natural gas, but who am I to get in the way of unreasonable investors?  The ship goes where everyone wants it to go and we just tag on for the ride.

It's fun to pretend to be smart but honestly, understanding the rational of markets - that being that markets behave entirely unreasonable - is the key to making money sometimes.  

And what do I know, I just parrot what people have said for ages and are far smarter than I am or ever will be in the investing world.  

I will tell you what I do know, the weather patterns indicate a colder winter, summer power generation is ramping up in a big way and I am bullish AF on natural gas in the long term.  At some point people are going to start buying crossover vehicles and that is even more bullish on nat gas.

""As to the glamourous side of the Surface Sales & Royalty segment, this is where IT and AI meet the Permian
Basin. This locale has unique and cheap land, plentiful and cheap gas, the possibility of cheap liquid cooling

an unregulated power grid for connection with wind and solar power installations.

Each of these developments—the datacenter itself, related roads, power lines, wind and solar, carbon

The risks are always the same. The government can snap their fingers and remove any person, company, stock for whatever reason. Tax fraud, insulting an official, anti china sentiment, not sharing info with the government. These are all grounds for disappearance 

If you are comfortable with investing in that environment, and you accept those risks you can start looking at economic numbers; Yeah .5 cut next meeting is off the table which is freakin great. More and more evidence the FED has their financial engineering tools calibrated for a no landing. Forget about soft.; gyna; give it to me, be real, is it still worth to get in on NVDA; Sweet, USD pops .6% v the Euro :); I have been very bearish & the job numbers continue to prove me wrong on this economy. So I bought heavy on the crude oil stocks this morning. $BP, $HAL, $SUN, and $CVI were the stocks I bought.  If we are really going for a soft landing, than the demand destruction priced in for crude oil is way oversold. Plus we have all these nasty wars. I also bought more Pfizer & British Tobacco and opened a position in $TLT, but those are boring dividend stocks & US Treasuries that no one else here follows : ); What’s your favorite undervalue stock rn?; This market is frigging great.  

As long as earnings dont disappoint we will be fine.  I see the s and p going to 6k.; Soft landing cuh; Interesting how no ones talking about RDDT.

My last 6 calls were pretty good. (Even though most of the market has moved up)

Picked up more Amazon at 164 while selling Apple at 220(old cost was 95$)

Picked up more RKLB at 6.6 (old cost 5.5)

Went heavy on BRK.B at 375 (performed almost identically as the S&P though in that timeframe)

Heavy in TD at 75 CAD.

Sorry for the potentially dumb question I’m not very good with stocks; Whew, looks like the market is finally recovering from indecision. I'll be glad to be wrong on my original prediction if it sticks.; A lot of uglily overvalued companies (i.e., PLTR, TSLA, CRWD to name just a few) soaring while nicely profitable and properly valued companies (i.e., ASML, NXT, MSFT) do nothing. Interesting market…; [deleted]; [deleted]; Since China is getting attention, and most are still on the sidelines, and that's OK because that's just your risk profile, but I would just say, ask yourself, what do you actually know about China's politics besides regurgitations from the media without understanding Chinese? Maybe you know about Tiananmen Square Massacre 40 years ago, and how terrible the CCP is for that? Just an example, from the crash on 6/4 on that date, likely the last major time when China was deemed ""uninvestable"", Hang Seng Index went up 480% over 4.5 years. HSI is ""only"" up 50% from the absolute lows on 25-year low valuations.; Let’s see if this report shows us recession or not lol; Awesome, the strangle worked out well.; What is the story on CLOV? I saw that it all of a sudden increased a lot in these past few days; It's crazy to me that yesterday Google comes out with a statement doubling down on WFH (work from home), after people wondered if they would follow Amazon.

Now today there is a report of Amazon cutting jobs and trimming fat.

Google continues to be a loser performer compared to the other big tech. And they never really cut half of the employees they should have after the pandemic. They are still stuck in the  pandemic, and employees are chilling at home or making tiktok on the job about how cool the benefits are, like the massage room, the nap room, and the video game room. They need to get rid of this sh\*t CEO.

This really isn't intentional.

Regardless, the composition of this jobs report is not reassuring. [When we look at the payroll numbers by sector](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t17.htm) most growth is in government, government-adjacent, or part-time work with contributing help from data centers.

Sounds right up my alley lol ; Not sure if I suggested them to you before, but a name I opened a position in a few months ago is MTPI. Not as cheap as a stock, but solid company. 

Good growth and super low float. Good ROIC and like no debt. 

They sell components for like satellites, aerospace and defense. 

[https://s201.q4cdn.com/767782554/files/doc\_events/2024/Sep/18/mtronpti-sidoti-investor-presentation-2024-09.pdf](https://s201.q4cdn.com/767782554/files/doc_events/2024/Sep/18/mtronpti-sidoti-investor-presentation-2024-09.pdf); Not a big fan of the daily predictions in general  but this looks too strong to me to fade substantially unless there’s some very bad news today. Russell 2000 also up very nicely premarket. Pretty much everything apart from defensive stuff is up. Plus the movement is based on new macroeconomic data, not just sentiment or the earnings of one company. That gives me more confidence in it as well.; MAGA and adjacent can't stand when something goes right for the wrong people.; The fun outcome would be JetBlue buying Spirit's assets for pennies on the dollar out of bankruptcy. 

The outcome of Spirit actually going out of business (probably less likely than restructuring, but even a significant shrinkage of the airline would be possible) is really helpful to every other airline. Laid off flight crews can be gobbled up by other carriers. Open gates can be leased to other carriers, though there's a lot of complexity around this due to their locations in various terminals (no airline wants one gate in a non-adjacent location). 

However, while I think the judge's decision was nuts.....ULCCs are getting killed right now. The majors basically copied their model and there is huge overcapacity on the top leisure routes. It was only a matter of time until one dropped. Also, a lot of the issues JetBlue was trying to solve through the purchase are not as pressing now (pilot shortage). I actually think that spirit going away would allow organic consolation to occur.; Two things can be true at once. Airlines flying in and out of bankruptcy is as reliable as the sun rising, and their booms and busts play out literally over months, not years.  Sticking those losses on Jet Blue shareholders wasn’t necessarily a noble act.; >Wages: +4% in past year

LB is at 2.3x book 35x forward earnings and TPL is at 19x book and 45x forward earnings. 

TPL is definitely on a better place right now, no debt and their book value is artificially low because they don't mark their land to market value ...still, LB is really interesting.; Ah, is this a TPL deal where the FCF come from royalties on the land?; I don’t like it as an oil play but for the other reasons you mentioned absolutely. I wrote a DD on it a few months back on r/wallstreetbets and I’ve seen way more discussion on it there recently.

It could certainly continue to rise but up 400+% is good enough; I actually rode PLTR from $7 to $50(edit: $40s) the first time after it crashed from IPO.

Still my favorite lotto ticket stock.; There was just a huge amount of options out there in both directions in anticipation of the jobs report, market gotta work through those trillions  of dollars first lol; Yes economic numbers skewed by the proletariat; The US: markets is generally some degree of good much of the time, with the occasional stretch of absolutely horrible.

China: market is some degree of mediocre/lousy much of the time, with the occasional stretch of ""stocks only go up"" after the country finally goes ""hey, everyone come back"" and offers stimulus and/or (probably temporarily) walks back regulations. The FXI is up about 40% YTD - much of that coming in the last month - which is great for anyone who bought very recently. Zoom out though and it's still negative over the last 5 years and getting back to (checks) the same price it was in 2006.; Fine, but the way people compare Chinese to US sometimes is as though there’s zero trustability of Chinese stocks and US are the model of transparency. It’s not the case. I think nearly everyone knows the issues there have been with Chinese stocks which does naturally lower their fair valuations compared to the US. Some think these issues don’t automatically make them completely worthless and that a floor has been reached. 

A lot of dodgy stuff goes on in the US stock market too. For example Nikola. Yes US stocks are more reputable than Chinese overall but it’s not as black and white as some make out.; Just keeping the high inflation. ; B b but the august recession crash lol; my personal opinion is that everyone comes up with reasons why it's no longer good and bla bla and then when earnings come around and they announce they made yet another morbigoritrillionbillon dollars it moons by double digits %, every time; [deleted]; Also bought oil today!; Might want to refer to /u/CosmicSpiral comments below for the truth about these fresh-out-of-oven job numbers.; Where to start? There are so many of them.; I like HIMS. Averaged up after the recent dip.; Instead of talking about things you bought in the past at lower prices, what are some prices and trades you’re making today and Monday.; Totally agree on RDDT. I'm in across two lots, $54 and $56 (initially bought at $56 then couldn't believe it dropped further over the coming months so doubled down at $54). It fits my investment thesis perfectly, which is that I buy stock in products that I use and love (when/where the value makes sense). Beyond that, I work in the advertising industry and can tell you with certainty that essentially every advertiser is dipping their toes in on Reddit, and that momentum is building. It's up to Reddit to prove that ad spend worthwhile, and admittedly their adserving platforms are waaay behind the likes of Google and Meta, but Reddit's data is wildly valuable, especially when we get into a cookieless world over the next couple years.

I'm extremely bullish, call me crazy but I see RDDT as a legit 10 bagger opportunity, assuming they execute.; Since the economy is so strong without cuts, sounds good to me; That's how I feel whenever I think I'm clever with a trade; I feel an oil price spike is going to make it harder for Harris to get elected, so Biden will privately put pressure on Israel to not attack Iran's oil infrastructure before the election.; (This comment isn't trying to express any political preferences here) I think the US administration is very very much against oil prices spiking and is probably lobbying significantly against Israel doing that. The comment yesterday by Biden was probably blown out of proportion. He was just saying ""We're still talking about what to do"" but because it was in response to attacking oil, was construed as a possible move. The guy isn't the most clear speaker.

*If* I'm wrong on this, then that's massively bullish oil. Which is why I no longer have confidence it would happen. 

Besides, there are other levers at play. Today CentCom announced a flurry of new strikes on the Houthis / US suggested more sanctions (very novel, I know). Yesterday's Beirut airstrike took out the next leader of Hezbollah + allegedly more Iranian military forces present in the bunker. Don't think we need to see a massive air attack on Iranian soil that destabilizes markets even if that kind of theatrics is what the public is expecting.

OTOH, I don't think a big spike in oil prices a month before the election is enough time for it to really matter to the election outcome.; I assume it's an excited sell off and will either be like this all day or go up in the last 30 minutes.; I think Wall Street may be getting ready for Israel's response in the next several days between Jewish holidays. Israel and Iran both have tons of missiles and their exchanges so far have been comparatively minimal. Iran almost certainly could launch enough missiles to completely overwhelm the Iron Dome and do real damage to Israeli infrastructure. The less restrained Israel's imminent response, the less restrained Iran's counter-response. 

People note that these countries aren't that important to the global economy, which is largely true. But, when oil facilities become a target for warfare and two countries lob tons of missiles at each other, it could forshadow a dark future.

But, full-disclosure, I sold off a bunch of positions that had minimal impacts on taxes both to limit potential volatility (I'm heavy in semis with a utilities barbell), and to scoop up if there's a panic buy. But I am definitely not selling my LT positions with big paper gains, and I never sell in my buy-and-hold account.; We've been basically sideways since july. Most up days seem to fade or even end in the red.; Meta has been on a tear lately. The one dog of big tech this year has been Microsoft. That stock hasn't gone anywhere since February.; IMHO, market is shrugging off anti-trust concerns a bit too much lately with GOOGL.  It could be devastating to their business and should go up incrementally, not zoom with market.

Disruptive search threat is very serious as well.  I think people already in should hold but make sure to trim and size position appropriately as it goes up.; I don't think there is really a right or wrong answer, just whatever you feel comfortable with. I think there is some research about actually just doing a lump sum invest in the beginning of the year actually does out perform, but if you like just investing weekly, just go for it.

The most important part is just continuing to invest and hold. That's the power of the index. Long term compounding interest.

However, the one thing I would call out is that both the VOO and SPY are both the same thing and I would just pick the one with the lowest expensive ratio. Like VOO has an expensive ratio of 0.03% compared to 0.09%.

It's not a huge difference, but over a long period of thing, it could be money you are saving.

I think you should be able to get on robinhood, not sure, but I think Fidelity offers the cheapest one at 0.02% with FXAIX.

  
Edit: didnt' realize FXAIX is a mutual fund, so would suggest just going with an ETF over it.; VOO is just Vanguards S&P 500 ETF. It has an expense ratio which is cheaper than SPY i believe. Don't think there's ant advantage to holding both, but if that's what you wanna do it's fine. Better than not investing.; [deleted]; Problem with ASML is it’s hard for them to scale because of how manufacturing intensive they are. China export restrictions have also hurt them.

And keeping your knowledge workers happy while allowing them to ship some fun... that's a great recipe.; If we have a 4M-5M housing shortage that will likely persist for a long time and rising costs for consumers, businesses of specialty trade contractors, isn't this economy working as intended?

We need more people doing these jobs and we are getting it, sounds like a positive thing for the economy as millennials and Gen Z begin to grow their families into bigger homes.

I guess I am skeptical of claims that government jobs and trade jobs are ""bad"" for the economy.

Edit: it seems the commenter below me is arguing that all the jobs are ""part-time"".  However, part-time jobs dropped around 100k in September.  Full-time increased by 400,000.; I posted about them a few months ago. Stock sold off on a combination of capex spend hitting earnings and a former director's estate liquidating his position. It was super cheap in the $5.50 range, but still not expensive. 

Plus, there was a take private offer for $7.25/share that as rejected by management, so there's sort of a backstop out there should the market not realize the business.; I'm not familiar with this one, thanks!; I blame Biden for this jobs report tbh; Imagine people who let their (brain dead) politics get in the way of profits.

Transport/warehouse -9,000

Manufacturing -7,000; “Employed part time for economic reasons” is in the jobs report. That figure went down this month.; From CNBC:

""Strength in job creation spilled over to wages, as average hourly earnings increased 0.4% on the month and were up 4% from a year ago.""

So whatever is happening is putting upward pressure on wages. you're right, this is one report and individual experience will differ, but overall higher wages generally correspond with strong labor markets. Wage growth outpacing inflation is generally good for workers.; My only wonder is even if Republicans win presidency, they probably won't win enough votes in the house or the senate in order to do anything about the IRA.

The markets regardless, are going to be hyper volatile until the election is decided.; I did it; I think you’re right that we’ll see more escalation until the US election.

No, because residential building construction payrolls are simultaneously shrinking. New housing starts are severely lagging behind finishes as well, which shouldn't be the case if supply was properly responding to demand. 

> We need more people doing these jobs and we are getting it, sounds like a positive thing for the economy as millennials and Gen Z begin to grow their families into bigger homes.

It's not the increase in construction jobs that's the problem, it's the lack of growth or reversion in *everything else*. And note many of those jobs are likely part-time as well; the sector is notorious for churn and lack of stability.

Government jobs work if they contribute to building the necessary infrastructure that supports private investment and growth. They are not productive *ipso facto*.; Rad. Going to look into them.

When over half of the expectations beat comes from seasonal part-time restaurant work - which is what the boost in ""food services and drinking places"" comes from - it's not a ""reassuring jobs report"". What Goolsbee says is as informative as Bernanke or Krugman.

> My point is that this is fairly good jobs report and I am not sure how you could conclude we are falling off a cliff.

Where did I say it was proof we were headed for a recession? When you look past the headline, the data composition shows a mediocre report. 

A strong sequence of jobs reports that would reverse my bearish stance would include:

* Broad-based employment growth across sectors instead of concentration.
* Growth in full-time employment, which has shrunken over the last year and a half.
* Job quits going up secularly. They have been declining since April 2022. In a strong economy, people believe they have the leverage and financial cushion to search for new work.
* Average weekly hours stop dropping. They've been dropping since April 2021.; I mean it's so cheap it's similar multiple wise to coal stocks atm, that's how bad it's gotten. It's crazy stuff to me; I called out another name to creeme from a post earlier here, but I opened a position in MPTI a few months ago. 

They do components for like radar, stats, defense. 

No debt for the company, seeing like 20% YoY growth and extreme low float. 

I always talk about how I like to invest, which is coming up with ideas around things that should produce tailswinds. Kind of like what you are talking about, like if RKLB is doing well and we know small stats should continue to see growth, it makes sense to invest in companies that produce components/parts for that.; Reddit is at $12b market cap; It's possible sum of parts is greater than the whole.

But if they broke it up, they would also likely enact fairly severe restrictions to the resulting pieces to ensure other entrants can more easily compete.

Also part of what makes Google so powerful is that their gmail, calendar, cloud services, youtube, search, etc. all speak to each other in terms of data.

Odds are the option to have data across apps communicate will still be available, giving google an edge for already having developed a following for these apps. Google store as well makes a good chunk of change. And, openAI in court admitted that google was the forefront of ai technology. Even in it's broken smaller parts, google leads in many of the categories individually. I'm actually excited at the prospect of losing dead weight on non profitable sections of googles portfolio and getting a more targeted focus (separate company) for each category; The seasonal adjustment (12,470.2) is roughly the same as the non-seasonal data (12,476.2). 

> September full-time jobs increased 414,000...

Full-time employment is down 900k since last September, as admitted [by the BLS themselves](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t09.htm), and part-time is up ~1 million. Multiple-job holders are up ~510k over the same period.; Yeah, it's a much smaller market cap, but overall high ROIC, low debt, low float and solid growth. It's good a lot of green flags and I think they should continue to growth based off defense, aerospace and space being in bull markets.; >beat comes from seasonal part-time

You can't claim it is only seasonal when that is adjusted for.  If they are the same, that means there were seasonal effects both ways.

We all know full-time had a couple bad prints.  It contradicts your concern about part-time in this particular report which is objectively good.



Just curious though, you seem to have quite a negative tone.  What are your predictions for the market?  It personally feels like you are trying really hard grasping at straws trying to spin this as weak when it isn't.  So at this point I am not sure what to tell you.  I am squarely in the camp with vast majority of economists that thinks things are going as intended by the Fed.

Let's agree to disagree and see what happens.; > You can't claim it is only seasonal when that is adjusted for. If they are the same, that means there were seasonal effects both ways.

I should've emphasized the problem was with ""part-time"" and not ""seasonal"". With their operating margins rolling over due to spiking service inputs and being forced to operate as loss leaders to retain market share, those businesses are not hiring full-time workers. They're hiring a lot of new bodies but not for the long-term.

> We all know full-time had a couple bad prints. It contradicts your concern about part-time in this particular report which is objectively good.

One monthly report is not a trend. We should be seeing secular decreases in part-time work and secular increases in full-time work.

> What are your predictions for the market?

I'm tactically bearish until the end of October. I think we'll see a pullback due to the market being overextended along several parameters. Then we'll have the typical post-election November and December surge, and investors should stay bullish until mid-2025. Besides having some downside protection, no one should overreact: election volatility is normal.

Long-term I'm bearish on the major indices because valuations are too bloated (Bank of America arrived at the same conclusion on 19 of their 20 metrics). That won't influence anything regarding my *current* portfolio as valuations have no predictive timing before 3 years; however, they are like gravity and will dictate returns over the long-term. Beyond that, the relevant indicators in the credit market are not flashing red and it always front runs a potential crash/recession. Although access to credit for small private businesses is terrible, SLOOS is not showing the same case for large companies.

> It personally feels like you are trying really hard grasping at straws trying to spin this as weak when it isn't.

Hardly, I know how to read data and look past the headlines. And again I said it was mediocre, not weak. Looking at the Establishment vs Household survey responses provides the best example: 

* The unadjusted September increase in government payrolls was +1.322 million, seasonally adjusted to +785k. This is the largest jump in September on record.
* The unadjusted September change in private payrolls was -458k, seasonally adjusted +133k.

When ~86% of all seasonally adjusted job growth is created by local and federal government, that don't imply a strong economy. All of this is easily verifiable in the [A-8 section for Household](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t08.htm) and [B-1 for Establishment](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t17.htm)."
1 Percent Risk (Long Term) ,"I'm thinking about investing 1 percent of my portfolio into a individual stock. But I want to make sure I understand everything 

1) Can I get rich from Fractional Shares?

So Far I'm going to put in 50 bucks a year into Amazon but soon when my income grows to 100k I will put $200 a year. And I'm going to hold it for like 30+ years. Is there a good chance that I can get to 100k or 1 Million dollar from this strategy? If Amazon stays on top 

2) Stock vs Sp500

So when a business reach there expected earnings for the year does that mean that they beat the Sp500 or match it?

Like is the only way they will underperformed the Sp500 is if they underperform?

3) Should I care about Stock share prices?

Like I'm confused on why Costco ($800) and ulta beauty ($400) cost so much while apple, Nvidia, Google and Amazon are like $200 to $150

Like those 4 overall makes more money than Ulta & Costo so why are they less?

Is it because they are younger?

Also should I care about a stock share costing so much. To be honest Costco is a great business but since there share is so much it kind of scares me to invest in it.

4) So since I'm taking a 1% Risk would it be the best idea to do the risk on my Roth Ira & HSA since it is a tax advantage account?

2. That's not how it works. Company valuations are a product of market expectations of future returns. The good news is that means you don't have to care about any single stock. Just invest in a total market tracker every month and move on with your life.

3. No. Stock prices aren't very relevant.

What is your plan for the other 99% of your portfolio? That's more important than what you do with 1%.; 3. Let's say you have 9 puppies. You can sell them to 9 people = 1 puppy each. Or, 3 puppies per person = 3 each. But now the total price to the person with 3 is triple the price to the person with 1 puppy.

That's like shares. You need to know the number of shares issued and the value of the company, to know the per share value, which is part of pricing (simplified greatly).

Look at Berkshire Hathaway's price.

1. Look at the words: *Per* share. If I offer you a 10% commission of everything I make, you get 10 cents of my $1, and $1 of my $10. The more you own, the more or less Value, because it is per share. If you only own half a share, you get or lose half as much as Value as someone who owns a whole share.

If you put $2m into Amazon and it goes down 50%, you're still ""rich"" but you have a loss.

No. Simple math. 30 years x $200 is only $6,000. $1 million / $6,000 = 166.66. You would need your investment in Amazon to grow 166x. For reference, it's normal to double your investment every 7.2 years assuming a 10% growth rate which is roughly the market average.; One of reasons you see some inexpensive stock prices, are because they’ve had “stock splits”.  For example, on 6/10/24 NVDA had a 10:1 split.  Prior to the split, the stock was selling for about $1100 per share.  After the 10:1 split, stockholders received 9 additional shares for each share they own and saw the price decrease by 10 ($110/share).; Yes, GOOGL had a 20:1 split back on 7/18/22.

I can see Amazon being like a top 3 or maybe even 1 company in the world in the next 10 or 20 years.; If you look at the largest US companies by market cap there are 3 companies with 3.4T - 2.9T (APPL, MSFT, NVDA) and 2 more with 2.0T - 1.9T (GOOGL, AMZN).  I doubt AMZN will make it to #1.  I own stock in all of 5 of them.; The way your Amazon investment can reach that high is by the dollar decreasing in value. This is actually what happens and how many investments increase. Over a long period a stagnating company will still rise by the level of inflation. So if the dollar decreases in value substantially the dollar value of a company increases substantially."
Challenge to find stocks matching 13 attributes of Peter Lynch,"I tried to find modern examples to each attribute mentioned in Chapter 8 of One Up on Wall Street. Then I thought this community could find better fits and have fun together. So please share you candidates for any category below - maybe we discover hidden gems along the way.

RECAP: Chapter 8 of One Up on Wall Street is  filled with fundamental yet profound strategies.  Invest in simple, easy-to-understand businesses over complex ones.  Identify undervalued companies with stable returns and less competition. And, search for as many of 13 attributes of the hypothetically ""perfect company."" The dream attributes of such a company go as:

***It Sounds Dull—Or Even Better Ridiculous:***

Companies with unexciting or absurd names often go unnoticed and can be undervalued, providing excellent buying opportunities. Lynch highlights that these companies are typically engaged in simple, straightforward businesses and the duller the name, the better the prospects could be.

My examples: Duckhorn Portfolio (NAPA) & The Lovesac Company (LOVE)

***It Does Something Dull:***

Companies engaged in mundane or straightforward businesses might not attract attention but often provide stable and increasing returns. Lynch appreciates companies that do boring things as they are less likely to be in the limelight and more likely to be undervalued.

My examples: Waste Management (WM) & Stepan Company (SCL)

***It Does Something Disagreeable:***

Businesses involved in unpleasant industries (like waste management) are often overlooked. Their disagreeable nature keeps them under the radar of most investors, potentially leading to lower valuations and higher returns for those willing to invest in them.

My Examples: Altria Group (MO), cannabis companies and Caesars Entertainment (CZR)

***It’s a Spinoff:***

Corporate spinoffs often result in profitable investment opportunities. Parent companies usually ensure that spinoffs have strong balance sheets and are well-positioned for success, leading to lucrative investments.

Found a good website on this: [https://thezenofinvesting.com/recent-spinoffs/](https://thezenofinvesting.com/recent-spinoffs/)

***The Institutions Don’t Own It, and The Analysts Don’t Follow It:***

Stocks with little to no institutional ownership and minimal analyst coverage can indicate untapped potential. These ""ignored"" stocks might offer significant opportunities for gains before they become mainstream.

My examples: Denny's Corporation (DENN) & Turtle Beach Corporation (HEAR)

***The Rumors Abound: It’s Involved with Toxic Waste and/or the Mafia:***

Lynch points out that companies involved in industries surrounded by rumors or negative perceptions, like waste management or alleged Mafia connections, can offer hidden value. The negative stigma leads to fewer investors and potentially lower valuations.

My examples: **Clean Harbors (CLH)** & Boyd Gaming (BYD)

***There’s Something Depressing About It:***

Companies operating in industries that deal with the less pleasant aspects of life, like funeral services, often have consistent demand and face little competition. They are typically ignored by the larger investing community, providing opportunities for higher returns.

My examples: Service Corporation International (SCI) & Matthews International Corporation (MATW)

***It’s a No-Growth Industry:***

Contrary to popular belief, Lynch prefers investing in low or no-growth industries as they tend to have less competition and more predictable business. The stability and predictability of such industries can lead to steady returns.

My examples: Consolidated Edison (ED) & American Water Works (AWK)

***It’s Got a Niche:***

A strong niche market provides a company with a competitive edge and often a virtual monopoly in its area. Niche companies can control pricing and enjoy high barriers to entry for competitors, often leading to sustained profits

My examples: Idexx Laboratories (IDXX) & WD-40 Company (WDFC)

***People Have to Keep Buying It:***

Lynch prefers investing in companies that make essential, habitual or addictive products like drugs, soft drinks, or cigarettes over those making fickle products, as continuous buying ensures steady business.

My examples: Procter & Gamble (PG) & Reckitt Benckiser (RBGLY)

***It's a User of Technology:***

Companies that effectively utilize technology to reduce costs or enhance services are appealing. For example, a company benefiting from the technological price war, like Automatic Data Processing using cheaper computers to increase its profitability, is a better bet than the companies making the computers.

My examples: Walmart (WMT) & Domino’s Pizza (DPZ)

***The Insiders are Buyers:***

Insider buying is a strong positive signal. If the people who know the company best are buying its stock, it's a good indication of confidence in the company's future. Lynch values insider buying as a sign that the company won't go bankrupt soon and that management is aligned with shareholders' interests.

My examples: Zoom Video Communications (ZM) & Carnival Corporation (CCL)

***The Company is Buying Back Shares:***

Companies that buy back their own shares reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases the value of the remaining shares. This action typically indicates the company believes its shares are undervalued and is a way to reward investors. Lynch sees share buybacks as a very positive move, often more beneficial than other use of capital like dividends or acquisitions​.

It sounds dull—or even better ridiculous: Valmet…


It does something dull: pulp, paper & energy 


It does something disagreeable: Involves industrial processes with environmental and regulatory challenges


It’s a spinoff: Valmet was spun off from Metso in 2013

The rumors abound: No mafia rumors, but operates in industries with environmental scrutiny


There’s something depressing about it: Heavy industry with environmental impacts, which isn’t glamorous.


It’s a no-growth industry: paper…


It’s got a niche: world leaders in pulp and paper machinery


People have to keep buying it: Constant demand for its industrial equipment and automation services


It’s a user of technology: Automates and optimizes manufacturing processes

If we combine this with the lack of communication with shareholders and a somewhat haughty attitude, many shareholders simply stopped believing in the company.

Anyway, he describes it as combination of all of the worst elements Waste Management, Pep Boys and Safety-Kleen, if that would help; Their business model is very slow to generate real FCF. These are businesses that require high initial investments, but then low CAPEX to maintain and with a high moat.

In the case of Billboards, in addition to making some of them digital, they are also buying some of the land where they are located, which will reduce leases in the long term.

Fiber has been the most expensive and without a doubt what can make or break the company. They are channeling a large part of the value received to this sector which increases the Gen/ adm expenses.

Due to the model, I believe that currently the two most important indicators are revenue growth and gross profit margin. 

My biggest concern is not so much with the model, but with the management. Let's see if Adam has the ability to deliver on what he mentioned in the letter.; I read his books 25 years ago, but I do remember him making a 10 bagger plus off of Leggs Pantyhose after his wife recommended them to him and he checked out the company. I don't think pantyhose are depressing or boring necessarily....."
The Crash of the stock market has arrived. Price/Earnings ratio just broke 30 for the entire S&P 500. ,"Almost 90 days ago I made a post in an alternate subreddit regarding why I believe the stock market will begin to crash within 120 days -- Essentially the crash will begin by the day before the election. I have included that entire post below -- and all of these reasons still remain relevant... Moreso than ever with the news from the Middle East today. Obviously the port strike is expediting things today. Nonetheless -- I think the post is super relevant, and for some reason, the moderators of WSB deleted the post after 6 hours, despite it receiving over 2.2 million views, and over 1100 shares. 

The ride the market has been on, quite simply, has been insane.

According to generally accepted wisdom -- by investing in the S&P 500, you can anticipate to double your money, on average, every 6.5 years. I'm not 100% certain as to why that's the accepted figure -- as calculating the last 14 6.5 year periods the average rate of return has been 64%.

Below is a chart of the average price/rate of return of GSPC (The S&P) over the last 14 cycles.. I couldn't easily find data prior to this..

|Year|GSPC Price|6.5 year return on investment|
|:-|:-|:-|
||
|1933.5|10.91||
|1940|12.05|10.44%|
|1946.5|18.43|52.95%|
|1953|26.38|43.13%|
|1959.5|58.68|122%|
|1966|92.88|58%|
|1972.5|107.14|15%|
|1979|99.93|-7.22%|
|1985.5|191.85|91.90%|
|1992|408.78|113%|
|1998.5|1133.84|177%|
|2005|1181.27|4.10%|
|2011.5|1320.64|11.70%|
|2018|2471.65|87.10%|
|2024.5|5525.29|123%|

While the last two cycles don't necessarily ring any alarm bells -- we have just more than doubled, twice, looking at the last two cycles -- There is one massive, bloated, shit filled elephant in the room... Price to Earnings Ratio.

Historically, the Price to Earnings ratio for the S&P has sat just under 20 (the easiest data I could find puts it at 19.4x between 1974 and 2017 -- I'm not grabbing any arbitrary dates or numbers here). The Median value has it under 18x, and there have even been extended periods of time where it traded at +/- 10x.

Currently -- the P/E ratio sits at 28.71 -- roughly 150% of what is normal.

In the history of the S&P, the P/E ratio has hit this level only 3 times...

* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Dot Com Bubble (P/E broke 30 +/- April 2001).
* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Global Financial Crisis (P/E broke 30 +/- October 2008).
* The quarter after Covid hit. (P/E broke 30 +/- March 2020).

Images aren't allowed in this subreddit -- but if you go to the multpl website you will see we finished trading yesterday, 09/30, at a P/E of 30.07

Historically -- what has happened to the markets after crossing this mark? In all three scenarios, by the time we crossed a P/E of 30, the dam had already started to break.

* During the Dot Com bubble, the S&P 500 was already down 19% from its highs, and would fall another 34% before finally starting to recover. By the the time the bleeding stopped, it had lost 47% of its value.
* During the global financial crisis, an almost identical story can be told. The S&P had lost 18% of its value by time P/E broke 30, and when it finally bottomed out in February of 2009, it lost 53% of its total value.
* Covid, obviously, was a much quicker recovery... as we only fell 32%, and had bounced back in less than 6 months time (reason for which outlined later).

**Okay -- so** ***Maybe*** **we have a price to earnings ratio problem, but you're still not sold. What else do we have going on?**

Outside of the fact that I firmly believe that the market is overvalued today, I think there are several other major issues that we are facing in the current environment -- and while I could write a diatribe for each, for purposes of succinctness, I'll simply outline them via bullet points below.

* Credit card debt is at an all time high, and outside of a brief period after Covid checks arrived, has been rising since 2013.
* Younger Americans are in the most trouble with credit card debt. As boomers continue to retire, it will be the working class most disproportionately affected.
* Credit card delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2011.
* Auto loans debt and average auto loan payments are the highest they've been at any point in history. Auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2010.
* The stock market is insanely top heavy right now. The Magnificent 7 (Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA)) now account for 45% of the entire value of the Nasdaq. They account for roughly 30% of the entire stock market combined. As of today -- they are trading at a combined P/E of 42x. A correction in these 7 companies would be absolutely catastrophic for the entire market as a whole.
* We are starting to see a weakening of the labor market. Furthermore -- I do not believe the jobs numbers are entirely as they seem. I think many of the jobs 'added' over the last 18 months have been individuals picking up second jobs to help make ends meet. Any reasonable increase in the unemployment rate have absolutely massive consequences.
* Many banks are holding on to massive unrealized losses. While this has the potential to hit the regional banks the worst, some of the largest banks -- including Bank of America, Charles Schwab, and USAA have unbooked security losses that are greater than 50% of their equity capital.
* Regional banks are at risk due to the massive amounts of US treasury notes they hold that were bought during Covid. In short -- nobody was borrowing money to buy homes or cars. Banks, flush with cash, took said money and bought US T notes with this money so they could earn some interest on it. This was at a time when interest rates were very low. Now that interest rates are high -- demand for these old t notes is essentially non existent, as you buy new t notes that pay a much higher rate of return. If any sort of bank run starts, these banks will be forced to liquidate said t-bills, and they will have to sell them at a loss. If too many people do this simultaneously, the bank will become insolvent -- like what we saw happen with Silicon Valley bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. (Side note -- the failure of these three banks alone was larger than the combined total of bank failures in 2008 during the global financial crisis).
* The US government still has a spending problem. Our deficit has grown by $500 million since I started writing this an hour ago.
* Global tensions are high -- and rising. Massive protests are erupting all over Europe.
* The US is involved in two proxy wars that don't appear as if they will abate any time soon.
* The political division in the US is as dramatic as I've seen it at any point in my existence. Perhaps those older and wiser than me can chime in here -- but it seems most are resorting to tribal, identity politics split down party lines.
* Commercial real estate is starting to buckle. Covid brought about work from home, and with many offices retaining those practices, or allowing partial work from home, office space supply far outpaces demand. This problem is exacerbated by high interest rates. Most commercial loans are done on 5 or 7 year balloon. When that balloon is bout to come due, the owner of that property will refinance the loan, restarting the 5 or 7 year period to avoid paying off the balance owed on the property. Many of these property owners that refinanced into low interest rates in 2020, during covid, when rates bottomed out -- are now having to get a new loan to keep from paying their balloon. However, with interest rates more than twice what they were several years ago, and vacancy rates skyrocketing, many of these real estate owners will not be able to pay the monthly mortgage on their buildings. Commercial Real Estate foreclosures jumped 117% in March alone.
* Housing has become increasingly less affordable for many Americans. For 2022 -- the most recent year I could find data -- a family earning the median US household income, renting a median priced US home, was spending 40% of their income on rent.
* Countries are abandoning the US dollar in droves.

I believe some of these issues, on their own, are enough to cause serious economic turmoil. Bundled together, I don't see how we aren't in for a very rude awakening.

**This economic downturn may be severe.**

In the three times this has happened before -- the action, or lake thereof varied dramatically. During scenario one -- the dot com bubble -- the government largely just let the companies fail. While I was only 11 at the time, my understanding is that there really were no bailouts here because the only people really hurt were the investors in those companies -- unlike scenario two. During the GFC, shuttering banks would have resulted in a complete collapse of the US (and really global) financial system. While I won't get into partisan politics, I'm of the belief that the covid bailouts were entirely unnecessary -- and more importantly for this post -- the reason that the upcoming crash is going to be so insanely problematic.

**Bailouts on any level, whether to companies, banks, or directly to citizens, will inevitably increase inflation. I don't think they are on the table for this correction.**

People have painted the inflation problem as a result of supply chain issues... And while supply chain issues didn't help, I think the bigger issue, by far, was the sheer amount of money we printed. You cannot make $4 trillion appear out of thin air and expect that every dollar in circulation isn't going to suddenly become worth less money. We just lived through this reality after the Covid printing.

This will largely tie the feds hands. Print more money -- we find ourselves in a cycle of ever increasing prices and higher interest rates.

**What happens from here?**

I don't know. Don't listen to me. I'm an idiot. Stock market will probably just continue to go up. I'm probably wrong about 100% of this.

The prediction in bold below is what I posted 90 days ago. I now believe the top is officially in -- that we won't see another ATH for a long time. 

**My Prediction? GSPC/SPY cruise up a tiny bit further, to +/- $5900/$590 -- before retreating to $3500/$350 by 12/2025.**

betting on a market crash and expecting a high risk volatile asset to somehow appreciate is hilarious; Great post. I think you have hit on a number of interesting points. PE/banks unrealized loss/etc. 
However, these points don’t necessarily correlate to a bubble burst or market correction. 2008 was mostly due to compiled sub-investment grade mortgages. I do think some companies are overvalued but their revenue continues to grow. So there might be some correction in NVDA or GOOG let’s say, but that won’t cause the market to completely crash. Traders took gains today, but it doesn’t mean they won’t reinvest tomorrow. I’m all for doom and gloom, and while you have compelling points, they don’t necessarily connect with each other. Let’s see how it all plays out!; I think something you may be overlooking is the valuation of some of the s&p500 companies. Many AI high fliers in there could be seen as skewing the valuation. Take a look at the equal weight s&p index, trading at around 16.5x 2025 and 15.15x 2026 earnings. Just something to consider 🤷; Something to keep in mind, is that SPY is the global hoover of savings and retirement funds, much more so now than it was 10 or 20 years ago. 

2 of your 3 crash examples from PE ratio going over 30 were from an era where the average person didn’t really have any involvement in the stock market. Nowadays, SPY and other various S&P500 trackers literally hoover up people’s personal savings, from across the globe. Even on countries like mine (England) where pensions are more powerful than the US, around 23% of the population invests in the stock market, most people set it and forget it on an automatic monthly investing schedule. The top two ETFs people go for here is VWRP and VUAG, the first one being an all world tracker with 2/3 of its weight in the S&P 500, and the second one just being a straight up S&P 500 tracker.

And this is in the U.K - we don’t invest in the FTSE 100, Japanese people aren’t investing in the Nikkei, mainland Europeans aren’t investing in the STOXX 50, etc. Everyone across the globe invests one way or another in the US stock market, specifically S&P 500. Most people aren’t active trader types, they just have a monthly direct debit so it automatically buys into the S&P 500 for them every month.

Even 10 years ago this wasn’t really much of a thing. But with investing/broker apps being so mainstream and easy to access on phones, there’s massive amounts of people investing in the US stock market. Much more so than there was in the era of the GFC or the dot com bubble. 

Like I said, nowadays it is literally the global hoover of everyone’s personal savings. This has got to contribute atleast in some way to inflated P/Es because much more people want to buy into it now than ever before.; This must be the impending recession I've been hearing about for the past 4 years.; [deleted]; [removed]; Not really accounting for the fact that pensions are largely a thing of the past.  So younger/middle age workers are basically forced to put their retirement into the stock market.  Would that maybe imply higher PE levels on average than history would indicate?; Forward PE of Sp500 is 22.4. Now you can argue that if companies start missing earnings badly than your thesis may be correct. However, a common mistake I used to make was applying historical trends in the past and applying them to the present. Sahm rule for example, etc. The fact is that the makeup of stocks in the Sp500 is radically different than a generation ago means that historical trends of the sp500 is pretty much as worhless as ticker tape, a sign of the times so to speak.; Very nice post! Lots of time and thought went into it. I appreciate it. 

One thing to keep in mind when using time comparisons is that monetary policy is not consistent. Whether it be moving off the gold standard or the GFC rescue or the Covid response, historical comparisons get corrupted. One of the most interesting graphs I’ve ever seen was the 2020 (or was it 2021?) S&P 500 index price movement but denominated by M2. It’s a flat line, indicating that the rise in a share of the S&P 500 index was the result of growth in M2 and not revenue/profit or any fundamental. Fascinating.; [removed]; I don’t want to be a “this time is different” guy but you can’t really compare anything pre-2018 to what we have now. 

Companies print money with very little capital requirements. Anything older than 2011 you’re talking about oil and manufacturing companies dominating the S&P. 

You might be right, you might be wrong. Who knows.; SPY is literally only down $6.

And this is on the back of a massive dock worker strike, not your numerology.

Relax; OP trying to catch a falling knife that may or may not exist and trying to convince you to catch it with him; [deleted]; I think several of the points you’ve made don’t mean what you think they mean to the economy/markets, some of your points I’d even consider bullish. Also at all those times you cited where the p/e hit 30 and it was already down 15%+, what about this time? We’re at nearly an ATH when the pe hit 30. I also believe you’ve fallen victim to sunk cost fallacy, you’re down on your short position and missed out on a 20% YTD gain in the market so you’re doubling down psychologically and trying to validate it by making this post and receiving confirmation (which isn’t what’s happening).; Increase in P/E ratio cold be explained by the proliferation of index funds and retail investing over the past decade and a half. If more money comes in it has to go somewhere the mag 7 and s&p 500 is a self fulfilling prophecy in this respect. In demand companies get more attention which increases the premium on their shares, combine that with the set it and forget it “invest in everything with the highest market cap” index investing which is the most popular these days and you have an increase in overall PE as the largest weighted companies demand even more money from every dollar put into broad market index funds as the attention and short term performance attracts more growth investors.

Ever heard of APA Corporation? How about Catalent Inc? Well if you bought any SP500 index fund you bought a little bit of that too. everyone has. So there’s a little bump on the premium for those smaller companies there too and as the heavy weighted companies eat up market cap and consolidate with other like minded successful enterprises through M&A you get a lower quality bottom of the list than you had previously, except they’re being bought more aggressively than a long time ago by passive investors who “buy the market.”

The introduction of ETFs, the move to defined contribution from defined benefit retirement plans, and the increased popularity of retail investing created a brand new environment in the market never seen before. Unlike the Great Recession, Great Depression and tech crash, these are not bubbles as much as they are paradigm shifts in how we as a society invest our personal wealth. The market is simply more busy with more players than it has ever been before. That may be something to consider when looking at the increased PE you mentioned.

As for the banks and their losses. These treasuries they hold are the safest investments you can purchase. As such, the banks have the ability to mark to maturity if they can verify their full intent to hold them to maturity. While your right that if there is a bank run there could be forced liquidation and trouble, your wrong in saying there are unrealized losses on their books because these losses can’t materialize in the first place. Regardless, as interest rates are cut these t notes will increase in value.

Now for interest rates. The printing of money does not itself create inflation and the inflation phenomenon is not as simple a supply and demand like many think. The increased supply of money does not create less demand for it and as a result increase prices. It’s increased credit that promotes consumer spending and increased government spending that adds money to the private sector that creates inflation. So to say rate cuts are not possible is not all that accurate and it really depends on whether and when we will arrive at the feds neutral interest rate.; The market has ALWAYS gone up after a presidential election because the market hates uncertainty.; Are we able to find the PE ratio of the S&P500 post 2008 though? There are new activities and environment that does not exist before.; If you go are looking for bad news, you will find it. 

I remember predictions of the market crashing when boomers started retiring and pulling their funds from the market. You can’t fight demographics after all, can you? Didn’t happen.; If my house is worth 3x it was 10 years ago, a car costs 2x what it was, eggs cost 5x what they did, I earn 3x what I did… why should I not expect a PE ratio to be higher? PS equal weight SP500 is pretty normal.; > Auto loans debt and average auto loan payments are the highest they've been at any point in history. Auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2010.

Did you normalize against the average cost of a car? I don’t think you did…; I ain’t reading all that; QQQ members taking a beating even when they beat estimates is the only argument I need to understand that we don't have a melt up. 


Thank you for buying my puts.; I aint readin allat but going to assume it's 99% bullshit; IMO, while I'm bearish for 2025, some of your claims have a large and small influences on the bearish case. To me, credit levels, unemployment, and consumer demand are king. 

Folks in this subreddit balked at my post here that, to me, puts things into perspective:

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fj7263/why_2025_will_be_bad_in_one_chart/?ref=share&ref_source=link

TL;DR: Feds cut rates, unemployment rises, demand decreases. Everytime the unemployment rate has made a rebound off lows, they go sky high within 12 months.; Good food for thought. 💭; I just moved all my 401k funds into bonds due to this escalation of war.

Thanks for the signal. I was already bullish though. There are no negative catalysts near term.; I think it’s important to think about “buy now pay later” loans as well, considering that they aren’t counted with credit card debt.

Edit: I read the rest of the post 😆; This would be more solid if you had footnotes on some of facts you are citing.

It certainly feels like there has to be some kind of correction but I am also aware of how attractive predictions of disaster are.; i like potatoes; Are you betting on a Trump presidency? If you believe the incumbent will win the election, then the markets will continue to rally through the election cycle and most likely beyond. This has something like a 90% accuracy in past history.; Most of the growth in the market and GDP is from govt spending.

Similar issue here?; Yes, the S&P 500 will very likely produce dismal returns over the next decade or so. You're absolutely right to be concerned about valuation. My advice is to allocate anywhere except large cap US growth stocks. International and small-cap value stocks offer solid expected returns going forward.; Why did u long on bitcoin if u r betting a market crash. The riskiest asset always crash hard.; RemindMe! 2 years; Except if you subtract out the Mag 7, the SP 493 is UNDER 20.; OP you are missing some key details. Yes, the S&P is overweight tech and that may be scary but if you look at the difference between the last two bubbles and especially the late 90s, earnings for tech are actually keeping up with these high valuations. 

Regional banks have already started to refinance CRE loans and in the event they do fail the FDIC will insure it and a big bank can collect it and consumers will be just fine. 

Our deficit is concerning but not as big of a problem as media makes it in my opinion… the US dollar is the world’s reserve currency,  currencies are pegged to our dollar and central banks hold our dollar in reserves. The chances of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA defaulting on its debt anytime soon is little to none imo ofc. 

Political division has always been there and as long as its not WW3 global tensions wont make countries hate us more than they already do lol. Also, we’re not Argentina lol. We have a sound banking system and print money effectively even though we go over the budget and we’re still in good shape. 

Out only real problem imo is fixing the housing market that’s extremely under supplied. I wish we could take some of those empty houses in China lol.

Don’t let the media fool you OP. 😈; 🤡; Hey I remember you. You're the guy who said the market was going to crash in ""120 days""  except you said it 4 mo ago.

The p/e problem might not be as bad as you think though since a lot of these companies have a lot of real estate on their books at purchase price. Since real estate has gone up so much if you adjust those values to market value it will lower the P/E.; That is a spectacularly long copy pasta 😂

I recognize that I very well could be wrong about all of this.; RemindMe! 90 days; Bank unrealized losses are a nothingburger at this point.  They peaked like a year ago and only get better as rates continue to drift downward and bonds continue to mature over time.  Since banks are well capitalized, there's no reason for them to sell any of those holdings.; Thanks for the constructive and fair response... Definitely something I hadn't really considered.; But...isn't the unequal top-heaviness kinda the point of this stance? If the magnificent seven correct down, say, 33%, which I don't think is particularly improbable, the entire US stock market loses 10%, to say nothing of whatever else might be going on. Movements like that could easily be destabilizing to the whole system. Maybe I'm missing your point though, I'm absolutely not an expert here.; The Magnificent Seven have a weight of over 30% in the S&P 500. AAPL alone has a greater weight than the entire consumer staples sector. Can't just ignore that and say, ""Oh, excluding these, the others are cheap"". You'll find that many companies besides the Magnificent Seven also trade at silly multiples, e.g. AVGO, TSLA, LLY, COST, MCO. Forward earning multiples mean little when analysts can't even accurately predict the next quarter's earnings.; But he has that in his post as a negative!!! So it has to be a negative, STOP, you are ruining his narrative!!!!; This is certainly a fair response. 

That considered -- what hapeens if it falls 10%, 20%, and holds that level for months without recovering. Does the rest of the world still have the same faith in the S&P? Do they continue putting their money there?; Imagine such situation. Aliens arrived to Earth and brought with them a lot of gold, rare minerals and so on, exchanged it to $ and started to invest in US stock market. What will happen next?

That is why it is not a justification that if retail/foreign investors came then insanely high P/E is ok, poor earnings growth rate is ok, trillions worth companies with 0.48% YoY revenue growth rate is ok and so on. It is not ok and in any situation (even on other planet or 1000 years in the future) it will indicate a market bubble. Profits of running business should always be higher than profits of investing in that business because otherwise there is no sense to run that business at all. But currently we are having insanely expensive business which hardly earn any money.; When the market crashes 10 years later: SEE GUYS I TOLD YOU; S&P500 down <1%

""THE CRASH OF THE STOCK MARKET HAS ARRIVED""; I agree. Outlook is pretty awful across the board. And if the economic numbers they are selling are truly so phenomenal -- why did they start this rate cutting cycle with a 50 bps cut? The last time that happened was at the start of the GFC.; >Yield curves are still inverted. 

10-2 has uninverted.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y2Y; pure poetry 📚; Hope for the sake of our country, economy, and Boomers 401k's that you are right, and I am wrong.; Baby boom retirement, forced rmd that were put off during covid.  Lots of things will keep money flowing; Maybe. 

Forward P/E is a fair argument. But I also believe the economy is in far worse shape than what is being claimed, and I think projections for future earnings are inflated. Current earnings have only been achieved by a massive amount of government printing (which eventually made its way into the economy)... and more recently, consumer debt. 

With delinquency rates skyrocketing -- I don't know how much more appetite big banks will have for further extending credit. Furthermore -- the amount of money we printed -- quite simply -- isn't sustainable. Trying to match that level of printing would send inflation back through the absolute roof.; Thanks for the thought out response. I'll take a look at the S&P denominanted by M2 graph -- definitely an interesting consideration.; The guy is going to be a good lesson. To others. ; [deleted]; I'm well aware that today's catalyst was the dock workers striking plus escalation in the middle east. I honestly thought we would find a new high about 2 weeks prior to election. 

I am now thinking that between the two aforementioned items, SPY will take a hit over the ensuing week or two, and while it may try to recover thereafter, it won't be enough to hit a new ATH. 

Once again. I know nothing. But if we all know nothing, my prediction is just as valid as anyone else's.; That’s why you buy shares, in companies that actually produce something.; is this true?; Yes... It hit 70 in December '08, went as high as 119 in March of '09, and retreated all the way back to 16 in September of 2010. 

In that time frame we saw the S&P 500 lose have of its value, with SPY retreating from over 150 down to under 80, and then back to +/- $110 in September 2010.; When a ratio gets higher, that means one part increases more than the other. In this case the price. A ratio stays the same, when both parts increase it decrease the same.; If the earnings would keep up, then we wouldn't have an increasing p/e?; 120 days is November 4th. It will start before then 😉; Nothing in there is written by AI. All words are my own my friend.; 5 dollar meal deal saved America! Inflation killer!  Super size my fries again!!!!!! Screw that super size me guy I could supersize for 14 cents, those were the days. 18 years ago; Even though my plays will take a beating, I hope for the sake of our country that you are right, and I am wrong.; Lol. 

I've made one post regarding the market is going to crash. It was roughly 90 days ago. Certainly plenty of comments... and even a post asking if we were overpriced roughly a year ago. But only one post before this calling a top. 

I'm standing true to that today. 

In 30 days we will have an answer if my timeline was realistic, and in the event I missed the mark, we can see what things look like in December of 2025 which is the only other price estimate I made.; RemindMe! 6 months; Lol -- valid point here. But I don't think they will be able to keep it afloat that long... and furthermore -- SPY could fall $50 by then and they can still claim ""Market is great, we are up 10% on the year."" 

I think big players all know it is coming. They will not be the last standing on a sinking ship... It will be retail, and people's 401k's/IRA's that left holding the bag. 

Look at Buffet -- He has sold +/- $100bb YTD in shares, while purchasing just $4bb. Smart money is already all on its way out.; That’s EXACTLY what they mean. Thinking the market was overpriced for “awhile” just means you’ve missed out on a massive bull run on any timescale in the last 15yrs.; Why didn’t you go short 90 days ago then?; 2 years or 10 years from now, you’ll be right sometime.; RemindMe! 60 days; uh yeah it's called ignoring whatever you're spewing and forever investing in VTI. it'll outperform whatever this nonsense is lmao

> I Think BTC follows

100% agree with you. after all, that's what happened in 2022 and 2020. oh wait no it crashed ~~60%~~ 75%; No shot. 

If crypto has long been held up by retail investors. You are quick to point out how people have less money now due to inflation and rising housing costs. If the market crashes and people start losing jobs and need actual cash to buy groceries or pay rent where do you think they’ll get the money to buy crypto? 

Like what am I going to do with BTC? Can’t pay for  my mortgage, utilities, fuel, or groceries with it. 

But hey if you believe it why not just buy BTC? It’s up nearly 4x since 11/2022. Meanwhile BITO is only up 2x.; We’ll find out soon enough. Either way, it’s always good to try and inform people of what’s happening using real numbers, so kudos!; I did a research on past recessions like this [https://imgur.com/nhqz8bc](https://imgur.com/nhqz8bc)

|-|-|-|-|; Just another thought, banks unrealized losses are mostly Treasury securities they were forced to buy when we had ZIRP for so long. All of those bonds will mature at 100% of their face value and will perform very well if we continue to see rates track lower.  They will hold these securities to maturity and receive all of their principal back (plus interest).; Unless the USA stops being the economic superpower of the world, I doubt it. People from across the globe don’t chose the S&P 500 because they’re a big fan of America, they chose it because there’s nowhere else in the globe that offers such a good mix of massive growth stocks and matured global mega corps. For example, I will never invest in the UKs FTSE 100 because it’s comprised of very matured and boring companies that see almost no growth, it’s the same case with Europe. Banks and Insurance dominates. I’ve spoken to people from Hong Kong and China who rather invest in the S&P over their countries indexes for similar reasons and also because you can be certain that business will always be stable in the US, you can’t say that for China/India etc. 

Basically, america is just the most attractive place in the world to invest in because it sees the best growth whilst also being the most reliable and stable. You think a world ending -20% crash for the S&P 500 is bad, look at the S&P China 500. Roughly -28% in 2018, -52% crash from 2021-2022. India’s Nifty 50 has performed really well and stable actually, but even so, they’ll invest in the US. 

Until America stops seeing monster growth mixed in with matured mega corps and pretty much unrivalled economic stability and security, people won’t stop pouring their savings into it. And the strongest military in the world defends that economy’s interests.

Also a side note, I don’t see the US stock markets growth elements dying any time soon either, largely because the best and brightest workers and entrepreneurs in the world all go to America because A) the best and brightest workers get paid better and B) the entrepreneurs with ideas for “the next big thing” go to America because it’s the easiest place to get Venture Capital funding, it’s the startup capital of the world. Conversely, this is an issue for the U.K. and Europe (I know of this first hand), and likely India and China aswell, because there’s a thing called brain drain. It’s a real issue in my country and all of Europe, and it’s basically the concept I just explained. Our nations smartest people leave us to go to America because they can get double, triple the pay if not more. Hence the name “brain drain”, the US hoovers up all the smart people in the world. 

So I don’t personally think that people will lose confidence in the US stock market any time soon simply for the fact that I don’t see any other country becoming a more attractive place to invest in any time soon - Americas closest rival is china, and no one wants to touch Chinese stocks with a 10 foot barge pole (relatively speaking ofcourse).; My friend I agree completely with your analysis here, I've come to the same conclusion but don't make posts about it because nobody cares to actually think lol.

Some things you can also add to the pile: 

- Election volatility 

- Israel/Iran Middle East shenanigans 

- VIX futures are now in backwardation 

- Product stagnation. Is anything new anymore? 

- Extreme market euphoria as seen by the last two drops being bought back with aggressive force. 

There is, quite literally, zero arguments for market bullishness anymore. Fundamentals are horrific, companies have lost their growth potential, rate cuts generally signal a recession, geopolitics looking bad as other countries struggle... The list goes on and on. 

Good post! Trade it carefully the timing on these is rough.; It’s all vibez all the time.; AT&T sucks, the other big ones include Exxon, GE, PG, Chevron, and JNJ. My point stands.; Yes.  Use your favorite chart provider to look at the market history.; I don't mean just shortly after 2008. I mean 2009 to 2024. Are you able to do a report of 2009 to 2024 and figure out what is the average PE ratio of the S&P500? This is because the S&P500 before this period should have a different value than after this period due to various changes in environment, Fed policy, etc.; You sure about that.gif; is this crash in the room with us now

ya weirdo; I did. 7 $450 SPY P with an exp of 9/19/25, and 5 QQQ $400P exp 6/30/25. I am down pretty heavy on those positions currently.; Why choose VTI over voo, ivv splg etc?; I think there are a lot of other factors at play. Continuous money printing leading to dollar devaluation being the biggest catalyst to move into other asset classes.; That seems incredibly risky. What happens to the price of TLT if the US gets a credit downgrade, which seems very likely if the doom thesis is correct?; You're not wrong -- I fully understand that the USA is the prettiest horse at the glue factory. 

But if I'm of the belief that we will see a massive, global economic downturn -- which I am -- 

Then

1. There are far less people to purchase the S&P 500, as more people are unemployed  
2. Eventually people realize that the aforementioned horse, while pretty, is still at the glue factory for slaughter. Rather than get clobbered by further losses in the market, they can buy bonds, gold, or even hold cash.; [deleted]; and here you are still predicting the same thing.

You should take another short today.  You'll make more money that way when it crashes.; lol 20th times the charm; Ouchhh; Up vote = laugh; I appreciate the honesty.; Yea its an up market and needs a crash for those to print; It’s like they say: bears sound smart. Bulls actually make money

Best of luck; You’re betting against the military industrial complex that has shown it will go to war to protect the USD. We care about oil and using other country’s oil because oil is traded against the USD. It’s in our financial interest to keep it that way hence continual wars and proxy in the ME to destabilize the region and keep it that way lest they band together and say “we control the oil, fuck the US and their currency.” I don’t think history will look too kindly on us.; Ok whatever let’s play semantics. Fact of the matter is look at the top 10 companies today. 100% tech except Lilly and Buffett. It matters and it matters a lot.; [deleted]; [deleted]; Bears make money betting against individual stocks of bad companies. Being a bear is going to get you slaughtered betting against the entire market unless you have absolute dumb luck timing, like 1% chance on selling and buying back, or have insider knowledge about why a weakness in a specific sector will tank the entire economy (financial crisis) in which case you might as well just bet against that sector anyway."
MSFT or AAPL,"I want to pick a stock to put some money in short term (under or about 1 year) and I'm thinking about MSFT or AAPL. Doing research, they have pretty similar valuations, efficiency (disregarding ROE for apple). I searched up predictions and aapl is supposed to rise 6% yet msft is supposed to rise 18%. What do you guys think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ftg51m/msft_or_aapl/,0,"Why not 50% in each?; I’ve been in msft since 2003 and the only time it has disappointed me was in the 2007 crash. 100% msft all the way.; GOOGL; MSFT

Hands down.; I am a die hard Apple fan - and still wonder why Buffett sold those shares. On the other hand, MSFT has more diversified product portfolio and better strategic partnerships. MSFT seems one step ahead

Let me add that recent bull market can be deceiving. Tech stocks make or break fortunes; usually considered unstable. However, paying dividends and brand equity may provide protected downside for 1 year , your plan can actually work; MSFT for sure until APPL start moving; One year is a very short timeframe for investing in any stock and predictions are notoriously unreliable (otherwise we would all be millionaires).; Both for sure, but based on recent price performance, I am leaning more into msft as the stock has been sideways for months. Both are A+ but remember that these stocks will move, so if you 100 percent need this money in under a year you are prob better off in cash if something safer. God speed; Neither at the moment. They are both great companies but you should always look at valuation. The price you pay is just as important as the quality of the business you own; MSFT all day.; AAPL = B2C

MSFT = B2B

For me, AAPL because it is more predictable in terms of consumer´s behaviour.; Out of those two, I’d pick AAPL for sure !; I wouldn’t buy either at current levels. But if I had to pick one, I would buy Microsoft. Microsoft is expensive but at least is growing. Apple trades over 30x earnings and has low single digit growth.

There is no room for multiple expansion here, and the earnings growth will get you 3-7% per year if the multiple stays in tact. If the multiple falls, you’ll be lucky to breakeven.

Now, if something happens where Apple is able to grow earnings at 10-15% per year, it could be a great investment. I’m just not seeing it. If they made a really nice pair of smart glasses, and sold a hundred million units, that would do the trick. But is that likely?; Seems like all the answers are written by a bunch of newbies.... 1 year is to short of a period to invest in stocks, especially such large caps as msft and aapl. Imagine you put your money at beginning of 2022 for one year..; At this point, they’re both just subscription services.; “Short term”? Either is risky for your time horizon of under 1 year.; MSFT and google; Aapl is going down this month.


MSFT is a long long hold, 8+ months; I just sold my MSFT because the last 2 years it only returned the same amount as QQQ.

Don't get me wrong, I have made quite of money off of it.

I figured I would just hold QQQ until I see it turn around.   If it doesn't beat the index, then I don't see the point in holding the individual stock.; AAPL is falling behind in the AI race and they’ve been faking the funk for wayy too long. It’s apple event disappointed and its facade its putting on for this “Apple Intelligence” isn’t supposed to reach markets till 2025. MSFT and META are simply more innovative than APPL is and they’ve gotten ahead on AI and stayed there. I say MSFT over apple ALL DAY.; Only 6% for Apple in the next 12 months sounds criminal, ngl; What is it about goog that makes it not as hyped as msft or aapl?; Do both...; If you’re holding for less than. Year I wouldn’t invest in stocks at all. You’re just speculating. ; I’d do 50/50 but AAPL is a one trick pony and that carries more risk.; Meta or PLTR; Right now, I’d say Google due to valuation and you planning to hold for only a year.; Apple is way more vulnerable than Micropeen; I doubt you can go wrong with AAPL shares. As for Msft looking like some glitches coming up. Need to understand how it will impact you.  Msft peaked last time for 16 years it did not recover losses until 2016 year.  Now with a new CEO and layoffs so it is trying to control cost. I just looked up analysts comment on Msft. Just as I expectrf, it is overvalued and lacks momentum.  VGM overall has a rating of D while momentum is really lacking- a F. There are 1/3 less analysts recommend to buy. Start in September a few suggest to HOLD and I have not seen in a long time some analysts including Zacks recommend M a SELL stock.; I won't choose either because they are too giant to be innovative. They have minimal potential to grow. I will prefer Nvidia or Broadcom; Just buy AGG if you need the money in a year.  Buying meme stocks during an AI hype is risky.; If it is one or two years, better IEF or TLT or GLDM, but not others. Please do your research before investing.; If it's only 1 year, then PLTR 🚀📈; Baba; This is what I don’t get. People ask all the time to choose between two fine companies. Just take both!; It's exactly what I did with V and MA. I couldn't decide between the two, and I split the remainder of my money down the middle.; Why not Zoidberg?; I agree you could buy two Apple and one MSFT and be happy; You can say the same for apple.. selling that stonk always ends up in regret; MSFT since 2003… end of 2003 it was 27 dollars, it’s 430 dollars now …. Holey mama; This year is was up to 468 then dropped off a cliff. Disappointed but we still have a few months left.; I sold it today to buy war stocks but I’ll get back into it asap; Too me, Buffett's plan seems like less of  statement about the market or equities in general bit more preparing for a major change of leadership of his company. He is in his late 90s. His best friend Charlie Munger just passed away. His estate plan has his estate going to a charitable foundation to be managed by his children and spent in 10 years.

All reasons to have BH redeem his stock in a buyback, which will benefit all investors. The company will still have significant cash reserves, and a still very large investment portfolio.

He has been outstanding in his role at BH and a leader and mentor for millions. A planned exit that brings maximum charitable benefits to the world will be so beneficial to billions of people. Not that I think that it matters to him, but it would cement his legacy as a philanthropist alsmot more than how the Rockefeller and Carnegie are remembered. He will always be a positive inspiration to billions of people and likely outside of the two foundations (and Jimmy Carters legacy) it will take a long time to see their equal.; I heard from a reliable source that he sold Apple for Capital Gains Tax reasons and nothing to do with stock performance.  Backed up by the fact that he didn't sell all his shares in Apple.; Are you die hard apple the business fan or apple the product fan? 

If the former, does the slowing iPhone growth concern you?; My thought was on the tax implications if Kamala won the election and added the unrealized gains tax along with the rumors of a possible recession; !RemindMe in 6 months how much msft has gained since today.; Tech stocks are always “overvalued” its never dropping to a p/e below 30 lol. They’re expensive stocks with unique prospects that you won’t get from any other equities. You gotta jump in eventually.; Also Apple is highly regarded as an upper echelon status symbol.

It will be purchased for decades.; i bought aapl sm recently and made a couple bucks, I was planning to hold shd i sell?; [deleted]; My case for not investing is that LLM will male search as is todas irrelevant ( having major implications on ads via search). I’m yet to see Google’s answer to that.; ik but if i had to pick; i dont think apple really counts as a meme stock; AAPL a meme stock GTFO lmao
But this would be my choice OP; Even if they prefer one more than the other, they can divide it, like 25-75 or 60-40...; You want to be looking at the long term steady rate of incline, including the dips.; What kind of war stocks?; Well, nothing is forever. Sales growth is not the only way to increase earnings. Apple can reduce costs or sell other products to existing iPhone users.

They will find a way as long as customers love Apple products; The tax benefits from Trump run out this year and will likely not be extended. If new ones (higher or lower) are in place they wouldn't take effect for a year or two. 

>*Buffett thinks paying taxes now on the massive capital gain for Berkshire's Apple shares is a smart move.*

>*""We are paying a 21% federal rate on the gains we're taking on Apple. And that rate was 35% not that long ago, and it's been 52% in the past,"" he told the audience in Omaha at the Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting. ""I would say with the present fiscal policies, I think that something has to give, and I think that higher taxes are quite likely.""*

>*So, Buffett is taking the tax hit now because he thinks there's a good chance the taxes will be higher in the future. ""If I'm doing it at 21% this year and we're doing it at a higher percentage later on, I don't think you'll actually mind the fact that we sold a little Apple this year,"" he added.*

He also sold all his Paramount stake so they likely wanted to cover some of the losses as well.

|-|-|-|-|; I’m all for tech stocks. I just think AMZN is a much better deal for example; Yes, true. But apart from 2021/22, due to global volatility and huge tech sell offs,  Apple has seen consistent double digit growth over the most recent years. Even this year we already have seen apro 20% growth and we still have a huge quarter to go. Therefor i would argue that 6% is very conservative. Especially if you take in to account the launch of Apple Intelligence and rumours about a new type of Iphone in 2025. AAPL has always had a loyal consumer base and i have no reason to see that change in the near future. Personally i'd reckon we'll see another double digit year next year, but i could be wrong ofc.; RTX, AVAV (drones), NOC 

All already priced in, any dip on AVAV I’ll buy (it hits $186-191 often); He literally said he sold for tax reasons; Lmao unrealized gains taxes. Sure.; Share price growth you mean. Fundamentally, eps/profit/revenue aren't actually growing by double digits for a few years. The stock multiple however keeps expanding.; Interesting!; Do you recommend I put some money into war stocks?; Nah, just capital gains. Close enough; I’m not advocating for politics here, but Kamala has stated she plans to tax unrealized gains. I’m not sure where the disagreement is here. All in all, it’s about taxes at the end of the day; Fair comment, maybe i wasn't clear in my wording. What i meant was the stock has traditionally grown in double digits every year (Apart from 2021 for obvious reasons) and based on what we know now i do not think there is any reason for the stock to not continu that trend over to next year. 

Having said that; Nothing is a given of course.; They’re already too high 

AVAV, they do drones. I’d buy price under $195-186.


NOC, might dip under $510 buy slow; sure but that's not what the comment that everyone is downvoting is saying.; I'm sorry but if you think an unrealized gains tax will come anywhere near passing and that people like buffet spent more than 2 seconds thinking about it then you just don't understand politics.; How long do you think multiple can keep expanding while business metrics like the ones I pointed out stay flat? That seems unsustainable.; I don't really understand why you are trying to argue historical data that i provided and which you can check on various websites including the markets that list them? Apart from 2021 AAPL had grown over 10% per year in stock price for the last 5 years, and possible stock growth for the next 12 months was what OP asked. 

Unless i am completely misinterpreting your question, in which case i apologize, i don't really see why AAPL could not continu this growth. Have i missed some major market or sector news in regards to next year or have i misinterpreted your question?"
This quick look at baba price/FCF says it's a screaming buy,"I do not hold a position. But maybe I should. 

Baba is @ $254B market cap. In 2023 they reported a FCF of $21B. That's a 12 price/FCF ratio.

Aapl for some context trades @ $3.54T market cap. In 2023 they reported a FCF of $99.5B. That's a 34.3 price/FCF ratio.

I know it's a chinese stock and they should be ""discounted"" because of American's perceived risk but this seems a bit excessive of a discount. Even when it was trading at ATH's it had a price/FCF of 4.5 which to me still seems like a screaming buy. Given the recent china stimulus and runup of baba, I think it should still be a buy right as chinese consumers get this stimulus and baba should benefit? Am I wrong here? Are there risks I'm ignoring?",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ftb6hk/this_quick_look_at_baba_pricefcf_says_its_a/,0,"[deleted]; I once invested in Chinese stock. Showed insane promise, I ploughed in tens of thousands of dollars. One morning, I wake up and ALL OF IT reduced to a few dollars. Luckin coffee. The brand was a big fucking fraud, kicked out of exchange, became a penny stock overnight. 

Never. Buying. Another. Chinese. ADR. Again. Just not worth the cost. Thousands of great companies to chose from, there is no reason to get into that market.; My cost basis is the mid-70s but I sold half my position at $108. I like it for the long term because it just really is cheap. However, the whole story right now is hinging on Chinese stimulus and I’m not as optimistic that the US investor base will get what they want. 

Will be revisiting after I speak with some China specialists this month that have a better understanding of what’s actually going on there. 

In the meantime, you’ll never go broke taking profits; Also one CCP decision away from annihilation; Baba is an extreme value (and has been for a long while) because it’s effectively just gambling on the Party’s next move. Might as well get your investment advice from a Magic 8 Ball. Or play roulette. It’s gambling not investing, because the economics of the stock market mean nothing in the absence of rule of law. Trust me I want to agree with you. I have just been burned so many times by China and won’t be again. And my worthless RSX ETF sits in my account to remind me it can always get worse.; The good: it's super undervalued, high buyback ratio.


The bad: 1 digit growth rate, it's China. 


I bought and will keep buying but will sell it all after my target ; People like you always come out after the stock price sees parabolic growth. It's up 30% in 1 month, and 50% from its low a few months ago, Yawn.; Investing in China basically boils down to whether to trust that CCP will treat investors fairly if theres something they don't like about the company. So you're basically putting money on a ""trust me bruh"".; It was a screaming buy at $70 and I’m glad I pounced. The anti-china crowd on reddit is so loud, you’re unlikely to get any meaningful discussion on this post.; NoPE NOPE. I have been burnt three times. At 212, 170 and lastly 140.  Same story. China is not transparent.; Hell no. The numbers they report cannot be trusted; How much are u buying?; Free cash flow is also at a trough because of investment into cloud. Considering analysts describe Chinas cloud roll-out and usage as being about eight years behind the USA and considering Alibaba leads the Chinese market similar to AWS in the US, just IMAGINE the cash flow number in a couple years when that pays off.; Chinese companies founders are at the mercy of CCP. The Chinese govt can dictate what the companies can/cant do. The govt can make or break the company with their policies. 

I have stayed away from Chinese companies years ago after this realisation.; Baba is my Chinese bet. Opened a position 2 weeks ago. It definitely seems to have made a bottom from its 4 year downtrend and it has a ton of potential upside. Obviously China carries a lot of risk as well as a lot of upside. I can’t speak to the fundamentals of the company but the chart is starting to look good which means that Wall Street is starting to buy in and following the money is always a good strategy. I would personally wait for a pull back towards the mid 90s before buying here but it wouldn’t be surprising to see this stock over $200 in a year or two; Stop thinking about Chinese stocks as if they were American stocks.; China has peaked. It is basically all downhill from here for China.; I would value BABA like Ebay instead of AAPL. So eBay price/FCF is 22, then you take discounts; I just want 120 in the next month and a half.; I bought FXI today on the 1% dip. Might have missed it, but looking for a quick 10-30% profit and I’m out. With a tight stop loss of 4-5%. No way in hell will I buy Chino stocks for more than a few weeks hold.; These people don’t have due diligence.; 📕; Cashflows

||TTM|2023|2022|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|AAPL Operating|$102B|$97B|$100B|
|AAPL Free|$104B|$100B|$111B|
|BABA Operating|RMB171B|Y200B|Y143B|
|BABA Free|Y138B|Y165B|Y89B|

APPL is a consistent cash cow. BABA, not so much. It's never just about a snap shot number. It's always about growth and risk.; Sounds good, you should add a position.; Remember that one time Jack Ma didn’t properly conform to CCP standards, then he disappeared for months, then resurfaced a humbled man who had seen the CCP light? 

If you wanna compare ratios and numbers between AAPL/MSFT and BABA, knock yourself out. But remember that there more to it than numbers, and those details can be pretty damn important.; They also own Alicloud, [Ele.me](http://Ele.me), a 33% stake in Ant Finance, Cainiao, and a bunch of other mostly unprofitable companies with great potential. Not to mention they are one of the leading AI companies in China with a strong reputation in the AI industry.; I was going buy when the price was 85-89$ two weeks ago, kicking myself now; After the ANT fiasco, I’m staying away permanently from that country.; Man if China attacks Taiwan, the stock price of $BABA is the least of your worries.

All your stocks would immediately crash. NASDAQ would be down 90% if the breakers allowed it.

If you’re seriously consider tail end risk of ww3, the hedge is to enjoy life now, buy guns, ammo, medical supplies, food, water, and a bunker.; Never thought about it till you said it, but it’s kind of a us presidential race…..  trump wins, no attack but high tariffs.  Kamala wins, things stay the same and they may attack.  I’d say the pot odds are in favor of baba.  I sold a put today and looking for iv to contract to buy a few leaps .; Do not check Luckin Coffee price. I wished I bought all the pennies.; 🤝

Nio traumatized me; Insane promise? A fucking coffee brand? Why?

Let's be real. I get why Baba is valuable. But chinese starbucks? Hell, even starbucks shouldn't be valued as it is. It's just coffee.; So true, I have very few rules I abide by 100% but that's one of them.; “I got burned on a Chinese stock once, therefore all Chinese stocks are bad” is dumb logic imo ; [deleted]; Except it ISNT a fraud. It had fraudulent accounting…like many companies. It’s the largest coffee chain in China and has shown to be a well functioning company.; You really invested in a Chinese coffee company and thought it was a good choice? I’m sorry man but of all the Chinese businesses to risk your money on? 

I agree with your overall sentiment but I just think Luckin Coffee is a terrible stock to throw out as an example.; If you learn anything worth sharing, please share it here too!; What’s your target price then?; This is a bad take. Even with the recent rally, BABA’s literally trading where it was in 2014 and down 65% from highs. 

It’s like saying “Yawn dont buy Apple in 2010 because they’re already up 50% in 2009, yawn.”; I’m mainly looking at the stimulus. If there was no news of stimulus I wouldn’t bat an eye at baba; Are you me?; Just because you paid too much in the past doesn’t mean it’s not a fairly valued company today.; I’d say Amazon is a better analog then a bidding sight like eBay but that’s good feedback; it's in this range now, you can buy haha; Tarrifs is usually paid by customers unless the market is competitive.

Most Chinese products are far far cheaper than US made, so theyd still take the market even with taroffs passed on to customers; China gets elated every time the US puts tariffs on their goods. They pass the costs onto consumers here meanwhile they retaliate and decimate our sectors. Look at what happened with agriculture tariffs they placed on us during trump admin. Shoot ourselves in the foot every time; I knew someone whose “big bet” was nio back in 2019. 2020 I thought they was a genius and they was, they exited in 2020. I just looked up the stock. Another fraud?; 50k in Nio calls down the drain; Its not just coffee. Lets not get into the discussion of how powerful companies that “create” a market are. Starbucks created the US coffee market. It got the richest consumer market in the world hooked to coffee. Now it is a commodities play, real estate play heck even a savings bank play. Its impossible to unseat starbucks brand now. 

Luckin coffee promised to be that in China.; Their coffee sold in stores is also roasted too long and contains ash according to a test.; its mostly the exact same stocks being pushed. baba and nio arent new to anyone here; You are missing the point. Complete lack of oversight, rampant fraud and unreliable financial reports with zero recourse due to lack of jurisdiction.; Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.; It inflated sales by 300 million dollars, how is that not fraud?; Not everyone is as smart as you. This is dumb money right here.; Imagine comparing Apple with BABA, lol. ; So you bought a ton when it was 50% cheaper a few months ago, right? And it was a much better deal  then than it is now, right?; I'm going to keep this very very basic for you.

Months from September 2010 to now... 168.

Months from April to now.. 6.

Do you understand the difference? I'm not even gonna both to discuss the other reasons why your comparison is non-sense.; Yes. I’m you.  In the future. One advice. DONT BUY BABA or BIDU; Just because CHINA injected money before and didn’t work doesn’t mean it’s going to work this time. ALSO please READ about ADRs. UNLIKE US stocks YOU ARE NOT BUYING EQUITY in the actual company. Basically, the Alibaba stock will buy you a stake in a Cayman Islands-registered entity that is under contract to receive the profit from Alibaba’s Chinese assets but will not actually own them.; Yes,Amazon can be a good one. But Amazon has both first party (Amazon) and third party sellers, but Baba really just third party sellers. Amazon=Baba+JD; I don't get why you're getting downvoted. Your points are perfectly valid. And Starbucks (and Luckin, back when it had potential) could be fairly considered a real estate and consumer defensive play as much as Macdonalds is. ""It's just coffee"", wtf? Apple is just a copper and glass company then?; People can go to many stores for coffee, including McDonald's McCafe.; You’re arguing Apple is a bad investment? Confused what you’re even trying to say here when the comparison is to OP’s statement that BABA is up 50% and therefore not worth talking about anymore; My cost basis on baba is $61 as the valuation was ridiculously cheap, though it’s not a meaningful part of my portfolio. Doubt that’s the answer you were hoping for though.

https://imgur.com/gallery/tb5EPvs; Did you misread my comment lol? 

> don’t buy Apple in 2010 because they’re already up 50% in 2009

I’m referring to the doubters of Apple stock back in 2010 because it had grown by 50% within 6 months. Exactly as BABA just did. If you slowed down and read what I’m saying you wouldn’t make these mistakes of trying to compare 168 months of growth to 6 months of growth when literally no one said that.; Oh wow I had never heard about this VIE structure before you’ve totally open d my eyes! 🙄; Starbucks and a ""regular coffee"" place are not the same experience.; Good for you. Did you or OP make a post back then to talk about how cheap it is? No? Oh, it's still cheap and it's a small part of your portfolio? Sounds like a good reason to add more. I'll await your reply with a screenshot showing you purchased more shares at this fire sale price.; Your welcome. Glad to help.; I literally did make a post about it lol. Although again I’m sure that’s not the response you wanted to hear. Why would I add more when the stock is already at the allocation % I want for my portfolio? People on these types of threads get so emotional for no reason. Genuinely cringing reading these comments.

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/DwO1Jax2qt; Lol, yep for sure. He definitely wasn't expecting that. Then still just arrogantly replies back. People are crazy on the internet.; That's great. I didn't actually care enough to look through your profile. Can you let me know if OP posted something too? Thanks, baba.; I don't really care cause my original comment was directed at OP and not some random person who piped in named u/callmecrude. Like honestly, good for him, but not who my first comment was directed at."
Anybody else investing mostly in companies whose products/services they personally use and love?,"I think mainly Peter Lynch was the one who among other great advice suggested that people should invest in companies whose products/services you or your family and friends use and love. According to his books Lynch often found investment ideas in everyday life. He encouraged investors to observe the products and services they use and consider investing in the companies behind them. That seemed like a great advice to me 20 years ago when I started investing and I haven’t regretted it since. Here are the companies I invested in following this advice and still hold:

Apple, Amazon, Disney, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Netflix, Nike, Uber, Mastercard, Nintendo

Now I’m thinking about Reddit lol. However, I’m not very excited about the prospects of it becoming profitable. Maybe a small position just to watch and see what happens in the future?

However, would be really interesting to know if some of you have practiced this advice as well and how has this advice served you in the past and which companies have you invested in? Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1fsoqet/anybody_else_investing_mostly_in_companies_whose/,67,"No. I take emotions out and stick to a boring S&P 500 low fee index ETF.

I might love a product or company, but that doesn’t mean they are a good investment.; [removed]; I do the opposite. I invest in Apple and Microsoft and use Samsung and Linux. Their products are meh, but it doesn't matter. What matters is that they know how to sell and bring profits to me as an investor.; Not only do I invest in product and service I use and endorse. I've also invested in companies in my field that I admire, or work at. Many ppl advise against investing in your own field as all the eggs in one basket. I say why let your domain expertise go to waste. Find the moat and the right leader, you'll have a good candidate to buy and hold.

My most successful and longest holds are founder operated companies. Specifically, technically competent founders. Just listen to their quarterly staff meeting talks and read between the lines. You'll have a sense of they are in it for the long haul or a quick bucks.; No because every product or company I love or use eventually gets discontinued/goes out of business.; No, I have no misconception companies I like are all good investments. That’s a terrible investment thesis imo; What about the products you don't recognize you use, like consumables. What you listed sound more like products people can do without... easily. Many you listed are not ""used or loved"" by me but I'll bet we share the consumption of xanthan gum, corn, or dextrose etc. . The only ones on your list I might use are Mastercard and Reddit. 

You might check in the ""consumer staples"" section of stocks then your food labels to see what you are consuming that doesn't have a services connection (like most of those things listed since services can be canceled as money tightens but no one will stop eating).; It's a good starting point for discovery.  Then I do my financial and strategic analysis to make final decisions. For low risk large cap companies whose services I buy, I set investment goals to (eventually) offset the expense of my purchases. 

Other times starting out this way leads to interesting rabbit holes to explore that yield a new set of companies to consider. For example my neighborhood is overrun with EVs, so that got me interested in the materials supplychain since automakers are not generally good investments and elon has been trying to encourage lithium production. So I started digging and found a whole bunch of companies doing interesting things at the basic materials level supplying important metals to the whole industry. Of course that led to discovering even more companies in basic materials for other tech related industries.; Nah, I try to keep my feelings about the companies separate and focus on companies with consistent stock gains over the past few months or more.

Really I shouldn't even be doing that, I should be 100% in index funds, but I like having some of my portfolio in individual stocks because it makes me pay more attention to the economy (and I'm willing to deal with some risk).; No. A good consumer experience does not necessarily translate to a good investment, and this thinking drastically limits your candidates to invest in. I invest in a number of B2B companies that I never directly interact with.; Same here with many of the companies you've listed.  I bought Marvel comics fairly early before all the superhero movies, which was scooped up by DIS, also the same with Pixar.  

APPL, DIS, AMZN, GOOG, NFLX, and also KO, SBUX, COST.  I had MCD (McDonalds) for a while, and made money off of it, but the last time I ate there I pretty much didn't like the food, even tho it was crowded.  It just tasted like junk food. That said, probably still a worthwhile stock.

I think it's a bit harder now after the wave of computers, cell phones, and everything that came during those years. There's a lot about tech I just don't know enough about like AI, etc.; Yes I use voo; I invest in Amazon and I buy so much shit there... I should have just bought more stock as well.; Yes Warren Buffett suggests that too. But you need to find companies when they're new and/or cheap. Reddit has too much popularity. You want to find an Amazon when it was in it's early stages. No hype, no trillion dollar market cap, no in the sheeple's consciousness. You take the risk but you get the reward if it plays out. If they go bankrupt then you're fucked.; The one that stands out in my mind as a miss is Chipotle. I remember trying it in 2008 and it was so obvious it was a great product that was expanding fast. Never got around to buying shares though..sigh.; Sort of. I refuse to invest in companies that I'd prefer don't exist. My sh\*\* list is the short list, so that's not terribly difficult. The rest I review and analyze for potential gains. If I think there's potential I'll buy in.

Although that sh\*\* list is starting to develop chapters lately. Because one thing that will get a company on it is them advocating political views as a corporation, no matter their position. I consider it the mark of an idiot that can't run a business. Because only a complete idiot would openly work to alienate half the US population, if not half the globe. It's not just bad business. It's unnecessarily stupid business.; Nope. Don't trust that my tastes will lead to success, lol! OTOH, since I'm an indexer, I'm invested in companies I love, I guess. I would consider a small, fun investment in a company I loved, I think.; Yea, I know what I like; Partially, that’s why I have positions in MSFT and  KO. I’ll probably look into PG too; Yup that’s why I have LMT, I love my F-35 Lightning. Really though I am invested in Costco, and while I’m not a member right now because it just wouldn’t make sense for me with where I’m at and my needs, I absolutely love the company and its business model.; I've been helping my 8 year old invest, and ask her what she wants to buy each month. So far she's been picking companies she knows and uses, and has been doing better than me...; Definitely. Invest in companies you love and believe in.; Best way to invest…direct experience, exposure to products or services.  This is how I traded Apple and Tesla for major wins.; I invested in ATT (T).  I get enough dividend to pay my yearly cell phone bill. 6% yield and it up 46% since I purchased it  about 2 years ago.      Also tinking of adding FTXG food and beverage   ETF.   its portfolio includes many good companies I that sell products zi buy.    I also invested in a utility ETF so the dividend can cover most of my utility bill.  My primary purpose in this is to covert a living expense into passive income that covers living expenses.; I like the idea of ""know what you own"". The problem is that what most people know is what most other people know: the big consumer oriented brands. So everybody is buying those, which leads to overvaluation.

Lovable products and a strong brand name doesn't help if the balance sheet is meh, margin is non-existent, but price is too high.
Case in point: DIS sucks vs VOO.

https://portfolioslab.com/tools/stock-comparison/DIS/VOO

And you miss out on the hidden champions of the commodity or B2B or B2Gov space.

Few people have experience with LMT vs RTX to tell which one is better (thankfully);  Most ppl do- I personally love LMT and what their company stands for; I got burned investing in what's in front of me, what I know, and what I use. Instead I look at the bigger picture of the economy and invest in what I believe most people need. Right now, most people need oil and sustainable energy. I also balance out my portfolio with other less volatile stocks in foreign banks, REITs, bonds, and ETFs.; Nope, just you. /s; I believe Lynch mentioned this familiarity more like another filter, you still would need to make an DD on the numbers but that way you'd be more confident on the viability of the products/service offered.; This is terrible way to invest money. Investing is a skill that needs to be acquired through learning and experience... Any person can mentally play different roles. People should be able easily play a role of consumer when using a product and ply a role of an investor when making investment decisions. The more roles you learn to play in life the better it is!; I will buy any company at a certain price, I will sell any company at a certain price.

So it's fine to consider what you know about a company when making the decision to buy or sell, but that should be a very minor consideration that would only move the needle a few %, I think. There's so much risk of bias here, and ""I will simply have no bias"" is not a serious answer.

Being convinced you see something huge that the market is missing is often the beginning of the end for retail traders.; Personal bias and anecdotal experience with products isn't a way to decide on a portfolio.

This is why certain stocks are dramatically overpriced. People just buy what they know.

Sure, look into companies you know and like but have some depth to your research.; I do.  I've used Nvidia products for a long time and that worked out really well for me in the past couple years.; Costco!! Just the only one I bought because I like it. ; Mohnish Pabrai recommends that to an extend. The idea is that if any company gets your money, they are already doing something right. It also gives you an edge in understanding the product. On the other hand, it might mean that it is hyped, so you still need to do your research; Added reddit to stock port for this reason.; Isn't this how Mark Cuban invests too, which is why he owns a ton of Netflix that he never sells?

I do this occasionally but not with my main investment account.  Though buying Disney because I like it hasn't worked out great.; Yep I believe the company surely does well if it’s popular; Ubisoft, love prince of persia. This thing is going to 10x (or get bought out).; Yes

There’s even a name for this bias, the affect bias: https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/affect-heuristic; [removed]; [removed]; I'm guessing you do use Microsoft...; Yeah, Facebook is a cesspool but Meta stock has given nice returns the past year; Lol. I feel this. Hate-investing.


In a just world, Microsoft would have been driven out of business decades ago, before the twenty-year exponential enshittification of windows that they've been hard at work on.


Now? I hold their stock. I give up.; [removed]; It can be a starting point, if you invest in a individual company you probably should have some basic understanding about its business and maybe the competition. That may not make it a good investment alone but hey at least its a starting point; Absolutely! At best, small ""fun money"" investment.; Imo, that's what makes the materials sector exciting. Much of the ""secret sauce"" in cosmetics, food, and even things like toothpaste often actually comes from the fragrance supplier and not the brand or maker. So if you discover who the best selling suppliers are, you can invest in whole industries quite efficiently. Same goes for renewable energy and environmental protection - investing in the materials that make it all happen is very necessary to our survival.; Index funds do carry risk and there are stocks that are less risky than them.; You’ve had some great investments, especially with companies like Disney and Pixar! It’s interesting how personal experiences with products can influence our views on stocks. McDonald's may not be everyone's favorite, but it still has strong market presence. Tech can be tricky to navigate, especially with rapid changes. What recourses or strategies do you think could help you better understand emerging tech trends like AI?; Yes! Such a good choice. VTI for me.; JFC, give it a rest; Sears was popular, and so was Kmart. Did you invest in them? Popular doesn't translate into profitable. GM and Ford are popular but aren't very profitable.; Interesting. Thank you! I admit I do prefer a fund not heavily into REITs, as I don’t like how corporations are taking over the housing market and making it difficult for small landlords to compete.

But that would never keep me out of a low fee S&P 500 index fund 😆; I just stick to the S&P 500 and choose based on fees, then check out who is offering it.  I also care about share price, as Schwab doesn’t offer fractional shares and I just don’t like them psychologically, anyway.  Makes me feel poor 😊; Idk why downvoted, those are good companies, which you know when you've already done your consumer research; Same I bought some toyota and birkenstock specifically cause I love their products; Samsung make good products as compare to others but i invested in Apple and NVDA because its make me some profit; You should read how much Suckerberg is burning up annually. The free ride isn't going to last.; It gets harder to pick some of these companies like AI and tech, though still the same adage of buy what you know and use still applies.  The only way I can stay abreast of things like that since I've never worked within that industry is just to read online sources.  I Google things, and don't go all-in on any stock these days unless it shows signs of starting upward, then add a bit more.  I still think NVDA has room to grow, possible PLTR.  I own both.  https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/09/30/once-in-decade-2-ai-stocks-to-buy-before-soar-560/

If you're already in  some of these: AAPL, GOOG or GOOGL, AMZN, MSFT, META, and SNOW. Then you're already following some of these companies working towards AI.  Here's a link: https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/top-10-favorite-ai-stocks-of-brad-gerstner-1354176/5/

VOO & QQQ have some of those same companies within them too if you want to hold a mutal fund with them in it.  It's still early, so there's no big rush to jump all-in.  https://www.invesco.com/qqq-etf/en/about.html?utm_campaign=BL_QQQ_BAU_G_S_ININV_PROS_Brand&utm_source=Google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=qqq-cpc-paid text&utm_term=12190225115_117285846619&utm_client=placeholder&utm_ver=placeholder&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwmOm3BhC8ARIsAOSbapWijvoBD7syLqFMHFYFz8JyNdU1Cb6gVYYcYcaHe1DVsByRfwJIldoaAicfEALw_wcB

Since I already own many of these same companies I just plan to hold them or add to them on downturns in the market:  GOOG, AMZN, META, AAPL, NVDA, etc.; But so is Tesla, Amazon, Netflix they make up the most of the s and p and would give you crazy results; None have been downvoted.  If someone downfvotes A Negative number is listed.  At this time I only positive numbers. Up votes.; How much? In 2022 they spent like $10B-20B on the metaverse for losses, they were still crazy profitable as a company, $23B in pure profit on the entire year... and last I checked they had cut back on the spending there.; That’s a smart strategy, Sticking to what you know while keeping an eye on emerging trends is wise, especially in fast-changing sectors like AI and tech. It’s great that you’re using online resources to stay informed. NVDA and PLTR both have potential for growth.; I have Tesla and am not impressed so far. I've made more in oil. Amazon is a monopoly and will fall over at some point. If you worked for them in some way, then you know they are inefficient. They need competition and they've become complacent. Netflix is stagnant as well. When companies become dominant monopolies, all innovation and quality go out the windows. Consumers aren't as stupid as monopolies like Amazon think they are, and Amazon is teetering on disaster, IMHO."
