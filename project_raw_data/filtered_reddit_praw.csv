0,7k -> 100k gains,"Wow how did I get here? I’ve traded options for a couple years now and lost small amounts of money consistently. About 1-2 months ago however I had my first hit with ACHR calls, shooting my $1500 to about $20k. I was ecstatic, and frankly greedy.

From here I fell into a stint of bad ideas, bad decisions, and bad luck. 20k turned to 15k. 15k to 8k. 8k to 4K. After some time I found myself sitting on around $5000 in my account. How had I lost most of my profit? Was it bad luck? Should I keep trying? I thought I had figured something out, but now what?

This is where my story turns a lucky page. I looked to the ultimate casino. What are these flashing lights? Why does it smell like cigarettes? I woke up sitting in satans casino. SPY 0dte contracts. (I know what you’re thinking). From here I went on a 4 trade streak that went as follows:
6k -> 19k -> 30k -> 100k. 

Wow. It still doesn’t feel real. I know I’m just gloating but I also wanted to share a few things I learned. 

1. Take your motherfucking profits. Fucking take them. Yeah sometimes 300% turns into 400% but don’t be a greedy bastard. YOU WILL LOSE OUT ON SOME POSSIBLE PROFIT NO MATTER WHAT. You will not time I perfectly and more often than not you will wait too long and lose out on more than you needed to.

2. Listen to yourself. I’m sorry but half the time the people saying shit are wrong and half the time they’re right. Don’t let some anonymous person on Reddit take the blame for you losing money. Lose that shit yourself and own up to it. Some people make a lot of money and are frankly way more knowledgeable than I will ever be. I fell into it myself, seeing someone’s profits and saying it’s gotta be my turn now. People are right people are wrong, find your groove. Lose your own money. But how do you find yourself on the winning side? That takes me to 3.

3. Luck my friend. I know most people know this, but to anybody that is new and cumming there pants at seeing various peoples insane gains, this is a casino. Have fun, lose what you are able to lose. Be happy when luck is going your way but be prepared that it can and will turn. Please recognize this fact. I lost money and lost money and said eh I’ll just put in a little more. My bank account was pissing it’s pants and instead of handing it a towel I unzipped my own. I’m so thankful it worked out for me. But just because it did this time that doesn’t mean it always works out eventually. Be smart. Or something. I don’t know I mean I wasn’t smart at all. Are any of us? I’m sure there’s some smart people in here. I don’t fucking know shit that’s the point. 

No financial advice here do whatever you want to do happy new year make 2025 special but not the bad kind of special. Oh yeah and spend time with the people you love and not that fake time where you’re kinda there. Check in with them. Put your phone away and ask them how they’re doing. It’ll feel good for you too I promise. In a while crocodile. ",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hs3rm8,18,2025-01-02 21:37:35,"

1,So keep looking at tech stocks in 2025?,"Seven giants drove the market rally in 2024, with artificial intelligence chip leader Nvidia soaring 171% for the year and Apple shares rising nearly 31% over the same period. But stocks retreated in the final days of 2024, with the S&P 500 ending the year with four consecutive days of losses for the first time since 1966

This basically means that the U.S. stock market this year will not be “Santa Claus market”. This well-known market indicator usually refers to the stock market at the end of the year the last five trading days and the first two trading days of the new year rose. Statistics show that since 1950, the S&P 500 has risen an average of 1.3% during this period and has closed higher nearly 80% of the time.



The tech-led rally in 2024 has raised some concerns about its sustainability, but more optimistic investors point to continued economic growth and improved profitability as reasons for the market to continue to rise.



All Seven Tech Giants Rise In Pre-Market, With Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon And Tesla Up More Than 1%



TSMC CoWoS Expansion Reportedly Exceeds Schedule, Monthly Production Capacity Reaches New High of 75,000 Pieces\]

My price target for TSM is $240",https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1hrw02q/so_keep_looking_at_tech_stocks_in_2025/,25,2025-01-02 16:18:52,"I'm more bullish on energy stocks and tech stocks; 2025 NVDA Target Price $200; PLTR; And energy; If TSM can break out to new highs in February I think it's well worth the investment; 

My top pick for 2025 is Google. They are just so incredibly well positioned.

Google basically from day 1 has invested for what is now possible with much of what is possible is thanks to Google.

Compare Google to OpenAI for example.

Search will go to agents and there is nobody better positioned than Google to win the agent space.

There is no company that has anywhere near the reach that Google enjoys.

Take cars. Google now has the largest car maker in the world, VW, GM, Ford, Honda a bunch of others ones now using Android Automotive as their vehicle OS. Do not confuse this with Android Auto. Google will just put Astra in all these cars. Compare this to OpenAI that has zero access to automobiles.

Same story with TVs. Google has Hisense, TCL, Samsung and a bunch of other TV manufactures using Google TV as their TV OS. Google will have all these TVs get Astra. Compare this to OpenAI that has zero on TVs.

Then there is phones. The most popular OS in the world is Android. Google has over 3 billion active devices running Android and they will offer Astra on all of these phones. Compare this to OpenAI that does not even have a phone operating system.

Then there is Chrome. The most popular browser. Compare this to OpenAI that does not have a browser. Google will be offering Astra built into Chrome.

But that is really only half the story. The other is Google has the most popular applications people use and those will be fully integrated into Astra.

So you are driving and Astra will realize you are close to being out of gas and will tap into Google Maps to give you the gas station ad right at the moment you most need it. Google will also integrate all their other popular apps like Photos, YouTube, Gmail, etc.

Even new things like the new Samsung Glasses are coming with Google Gemini/Astra built in.

There just was never really a chance for OpenAI. Google has basically built the company for all of this and done the investment to win the space.

The big question is what Apple will ultimately do? They are just not built to provide this technology themselves.

I believe that Apple at some point will just do a deal with Google where they share in the revenue generated by Astra/Gemini from iOS devices. Same thing they are doing with the car makers and TV makers.

They will need to because of how many popular applications Google has.

Astra will also be insanely profitable for Google. There is so many more revenue generation opportunities with an Agent than there is with just search.

BTW, it will also be incredibly sticky. Once your agent knows you there is little chance you are going to switch to a different one. This is why first mover is so important with the agent and why Google is making sure they are out in front with this technology.

Plus the agent is going to know you far better than anything there is today so the ads will also be a lot more valuable for Google.

The other thing that Google did that helps assure the win is spending the billions on the TPUs starting over a decade ago. Google is not stuck paying the massive Nvidia tax that OpenAI is stuck paying. Plus Google does not have to wait in the Nvidia line.

That is how Google can offer things like Veo2 for free versus OpenAI Sora

https://www.reddit.com/link/1hg6868/video/sopmwriocd7e1/player?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=OpenAI&utm_content=t3_1hg6868

Or how Google is able to offer Gemini Flash 2.0 for free. But this is a very common MO for Google. They offer this stuff for free and suck out all the money and hurt investment into competitors. Then once the competition is gone Google will bump up the ads and/or subscription price. Plus the fact that people are not going to want to switch Agents it will also allow Google to bump up the ads without losing material customers.

The other place Google just blows OpenAI away is in terms of research. Last NeurIPS Google had twice the papers accepted as next best.

Plus next best was NOT OpenAI. Google has led in papers accepted every single year over the last 10+ years.

Most years Google has been #1 and #2 as they use to breakout Deepmind from Google Brain.

OpenAI has NOT even registered and not been in the top 5 a single year.; im bullish on penny stocks lol; Still worth watching tech, but 2025 might demand more cherry-picking. NVDA and MSFT don’t carry forever; Do you think the world will rely on more technology or less technology in 10 years?; Zeekr Intelligent Technology; No. Don't do that. FOMO is only rewarded in the short term.; I stayed out of US market all year, as I thought it was overvalued at the start of 24! Fortunately for me, the companies I chose gave me an almost exact match to the Nasdaq return...very happy with that.

I'm still too afraid of the valuations in US market, sure you could pick some individual companies that have value but the ETF funds scare me.

This year, I've gone big on heavily discounted UK based investment trusts paying massive dividands. Plan is to collect the dividends and wait for the valuations to close towards the NAV and make an absolute killing! wish me luck...; I've read healthcare and energy stocks could be profitable. Magnificent Seven can probably undergo a correction/consolidation, they have seen massive profits in 2024.; I think quantum computing stocks and energy stocks will be pretty bullish in the short term, though the quantum stocks are looking pretty bubbly (looking at you RGTI); My one and only dream is to see PLTR at 50% off from here... I dream about it day and night, and even when I eat from time to time. lol; This post doesn't make any sense. 

*“Santa Claus market”*

You mean ""Santa Claus Rally"" - which is a rally around Christmas. Christmas is over.

""*the last five trading days and the first two trading days of the new year... Statistics show that since 1950, the S&P 500 has risen an average of 1.3% during this period and has closed higher nearly 80% of the time.""*

*""All Seven Tech Giants Rise In Pre-Market, With Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon And Tesla Up More Than 1%""*

And now their average is -4%.

Do who cares what they opened at today when your data point is 7 days? Lol. Maybe wait for close today at least? Currently, the spy is -0.6%.

Regardless, the market was down 2% over the last 5 days of 2024.

So, if you're looking for a 1.5% rise, the market has to go up 3.3% by the end of tomorrow.

Also, the S&P isn't the mag 7. It's the S&P.

*""continued economic growth""*

There is no data supporting the idea of economic growth. Everything points to the inverse.

People like to say ""future profits"" without considering what that means in terms of real data.

The forward P/E of the current favorite tech companies makes them silly to buy.

PLTR- people are paying $172 for every $1 the company projects to earn in the next twelve months.

TSLA - $115 for every $1

APPL, NVDA - and the average of the ""Mag 7"" - $30 for every $1

If any of these companies miss earnings, what do you think the market will do?

Paying $115 of $30 for a share of earnings when there are no earnings or there are losses generally doesn't go over well.; I was with you in all the macro writeup until the arbitrary price target for TSM without any quantitative rationale.  I can change that number from $240 to $500 and this post reads exactly the same.   How do you arrive at $240?; Where is INTC? 😝; Buy baba will be the best decision in 2025; I’m paying more and more attention to energy and real estate.; > bullish on energy stocks 

why?; Any you recommend to look at? I should probamly diversify my portfolio a bit more lol; Why?; Not likely IMO, while it was somehow a bit under the radar after 2023 after a great bounceback for some reason, everyone, their mother, and their grandma are now invested in this stock. 

Company will be fine for the longer haul, but even if you can argue that it's cheap here, it's gotten to where it's too ""too"" retail loved.; Dude how much did you bet on Nvidia?; Q1 ‘25 NVDA PT $150
Q4 ‘25 NVDA PT $190; Based on... 

You think the forward P/E at 30 isn't silly enough? 

That price puts forward P/E at 43.

You think people want to pay $43 for every $1 of earnings the company ESTIMATES they will make over the next 12 MONTHS?

Delusional, my dude.

I like the company and all but there are better bets to make with your money than that.

I'm not betting $43 on a black/red roulette spin so I can earn $1.; Forward P/E of 172.

You're paying $172 for every $1 of *expected* future earnings over the next twelve months.

Eesh. Dude.; And my axe; Of course, all of this is going to take some time, but I don't think breaking out to new highs is going to be hard for TSM; VLN lol; [cool](); Do you think that every company who is at the forefront of tech right now will be at the forefront in 10 years?; Everyone understands this; Of course, it doesn't want to keep going up like the other giants, and I'll sell once it reaches the right price; It's forward P/E is 172.

People are paying $172 for every $1 of projected earnings over the next 12 months.

And you want it to go up 50%? Lol. 

Stop dreaming before it turns into a nightmare.

You're in a momentum/euphoria trade. That stuff fades and then people start looking at price vs. value.; But the whole post is dopey.

He's looking for a 1.3% gain on the S&P over the last 5 days of 2024 and first 2 days of 2025.

That means the market has to go up by 3.3% by end of day tomorrow.

More than that if today's close sucks.; Before my grandmother died, she told me not to invest in INTC; I’m holding Baba since 2015 now.   Something better happens.; ill think about real estate when the 10yr hits mmm 5.00%; Contrarian move. 

I initially felt that most oil stocks were a sell on a Trump move, but I now think that's wrong at least initially.

You just have too many people on both sides really that think Trump/GOP=lower oil prices. 

Don't think crude oil really spikes, but I think it can see up to $90 by spring and make folks expecting inflation relief really squirm.

TL/DR: Good chance the idea of real inflation relief happening doesn't occur and Trump is hiring Kevin Warsh for when Jay Powell's term is up next year.; NVIDIA is a good investment; priced in?; So what? That doesn't guarantee that tech company X or tech company Y is going to be the one to bet on.

So goofy.; no, down -50%.

or even -66.66% from here.; What else did your grandmother tell you?; Trump's promise to escalate the trade war with China will certainly help your position...; Oil dumps in a recession. Trump wants to increase supply when demand is already falling.

DCA is my approach.

If I'm wrong about recession then there is a little profit on a rally.

If I'm right, then I should be happy in a couple years.; Based on what? 

The forward P/E is 30. 

Semi conductors are a cyclical market.

You think every business is going to update their tech every quarter? Every year?

NVDA is nice and all but the non-researched, emotionally based love fest for the stock is just ridiculous. That's not how to make investment decisions.; Ah. ""off"" confused me. 

Yeah. It's a good short. Momentum trade so hard to predict when it will tumble.; Yeah, I'm thinking that the drill baby drill/recession thesis doesn't work at least for 2025.

It takes two to dance in regards to the drill baby drill idea and the oil companies are saying nah we gucchi.; They're probably basing it on the official reveals and releases of all the new cards coming within the month not realising that the gaming market is *not* where NVIDIA makes the bulk of their money lol."

3,"Are Meta, Apple and Alphabet's dividend payouts actually an effective use of cash?","For all three dividend payout yield sits at around 0.5%. This means that even if the payouts were trebled (and this would take several years of incremental increases, unless the tree decide to go the Visa route and increase payouts by around 10% per annum) the investor would only gain an anemic 1.5% CAGR from dividends. I understand that tech companies aren't the place you go for dividend payouts, but 0.5% or less seems somewhat pointless to me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hr2cbg/are_meta_apple_and_alphabets_dividend_payouts/,141,2025-01-01 13:50:10,"Yes because that way they make it into the large cap dividend funds and get more buyers for their stock.; It’s not meaningless to the old guys who got the stock 40 years ago with a billion splits, I’ll bet they’re getting 20% on their initial investment or more.; Some would argue that the simple fact that you and others “don’t like it” is actually the point. When a company see itself changing from a high growth phase of its life cycle to a more modest growth phase, paying a dividend can start to change its investor base, thus changing shareholder expectations in how the company is managed. 

While these companies can absolutely continue to grow, they likely cannot repeat the growth that they have had over the past decade (especially Apple, IMO). 

Just a thought from an online stranger.; Look at NVDA with their 0.03% dividend yield...

I get the intention behind it (included in more indexed funds) but I'd much prefer buybacks instead.; It’s an amazing invention imo. Keep people holding a stock for decades and the payout is almost nothing to most retail investors.; Apple was forced to start paying dividends because their cash pool was too big and investors kept asking on every conference call. I guess Google and Facebook got to the same point and follow Apple's lead.

And if you look at Google's graveyard, maybe they should've paid more dividends rather than dumping money into things like Allo and Duo. I think 99% of the investors would (correctly) want a tiny payout than watch Google dropping a billion dollar into another (their 5th?) chat app before the project even starts.; Not an effective use for Meta or Alphabet imo. They both have incredible runways and opportunities to invest, same for Microsoft which you oddly enough didn't mention. Apple, yeah, they just have no idea what to do with their money and it makes sense to me.

Oh, I include buybacks here btw. Same thing anyway.; Academic literature has found that investors interpret dividend changes as a signaling component to the stability of earnings.  This impacts stock performance more than the financial aspect of the dividend itself.   It ends up being an effective use of cash for them for this reason, but not for me as an investor.  It is absolutely a waste of time from my perspective.; I would say absolutely. Companies do stupid shit when they have too much money and all 3 companies print obscene amounts of it.

We have seen what happens when Zuck has more Metabucks than he knows what to do with. You get the fucking metaverse. 

Google also has a pretty good track record of blowing cash on random crap.; Dividend giving is a scam. A company should always prefer buybacks since they offer tax advantage. The only use of dividends is to make some grandma funds consider the stock for purchase.;  Don't you need to already have a lot of money for you to be able to get a decent chunk of cash at this point?; Yes. These companies have so much free cash flow that they don't know what to do with it and use dividends as a form to return money to investors, Their payout ratios are so low that that they probably should be paying more of a dividend but atleast them buying back stock over this past decade has provided good shareholder value.; Isn't it also low because they kept mooning, which would make the % lower?

Like how is nvidia's dividend supposed to have caught up these past few years?; Could be multiple reasons: They might did it to increase hype and atract dividen investors, they had extra cash, they didnt have better use for it. It could have been anything. Those companies have soo much FCF it doesnt really matter if they pay such a low divi.; Yes and they have relatively low dividend rate.; The concern shouldn't be what the yield is, the concern is if they have something better to do with the money. Those companies are so profitable they end up having more money than they can effectively reinvest into the company. Returning that money to the investors becomes the only reasonable option, either through dividends or buybacks. This gives the investors the option to do what they want with this excess cash that the company can't figure out what to do with.

This may seem a little ridiculous when it ends up being 0.5%, but keep in mind that is still many, many billions of dollars they would need to figure out how to utilize to generate meaningful ROI. That isn't something easy to do without throwing a lot of that money away.; Very insightful comments on this thread.  One other issue is if these companies were to slash/eliminate the dividend to repurpose the cash spend, there stocks would tank.; There was a time Apple didn’t pay a dividend and was sitting on a huge pile of cash that kept getting larger. It would have been near immoral to keep amassing that pile of cash without paying any of it back to investors who saw the company through the tough years and kept the stock afloat.; Personally, I would prefer the money being used for buybacks, not dividends.  I'm in these stocks for price appreciation, not a small amount of taxable income.; If you only look at the dividend in terms of its current value, it does seem pointlessly low. But if you've been holding any of these stocks for longer than 5 years the returns are pretty good with just the dividend.

0.04% yield on apple's $250 is only $10, but if you've been holding the stock since the 90s when the value of the stock was less than $1, you're returns are absolutely insane without even taking into account the increase in value.

taking into account share splits

1000 shares in 95' would have costed about $400~ 

those same 1000 shares today are now yielding you $10,000 dollars in dividends every year.; Great use of cash. Much better paying dividends than Apple pissing even more money away on buybacks at ridiculous valuations or Meta pissing money away on Reality Labs.; I bought META at $19 and change and it has been sitting in my taxable account for a decade.  My gains are too high to sell it, so I was thrilled when they started paying a dividend no matter how meager.  

Two years ago I moved my AAPL holding to my taxable account because the dividend was so low.  I would much rather own the high payers in an IRA and pay the pittance of tax on AAPL's dividend.; I have no idea how investments work at the scale of aapl, or any mag7 for that matter, but if you can get 5% in short term bonds and pay out .6%, doesn't that arbitrage spread mean something positive for the company?; You are holding them for the growth ; 40$ each quarter from Nvidia is the best feeling ever...; IMO no. I’d rather money goes towards buybacks. Amazon is the last cash printing big tech company not to pay a dividend. I hope they keep it that way.; oh yes i forgot about that, it gets them listed in dividend funds. Probably the same reason NVIDIA pays a ridiculously small, like 0.03% dividend; This. And added stability; Most dividend funds don't buy stocks with such a low dividend yield.; Facebook/Meta didn't really have a choice. They spent tens of billions on the metaverse, it was a flop, and big investors were getting really impatient.

It was the only way for them to tell Wall Street, 'we've learned from our lessons, matured, and are ready to be responsible adults.'; Steve Ballmer got $1bn in dividends from just MSFT.; or they could just periodically sell the stock and end up in the same place, dividends don't magically make them more money.; Why should they buy back shares when the shares are overvalued? That's a poor use of capital.; Depends on valuation. I'd rather $AAPL pay a dividend if the stock is trading at >30x free cash flow and I'd rather a buyback if it is trading <20x free cash flow.; does being included in those index funds actually boost share price though? Amazon has outperformed Apple over the past decade by at least 100% so I don't really the tangible proof on the index fund argument; All of those 0.03-0.08% are meaningless; Google has no idea what they're doing, and it shows.  People love to say ""Look at all the money they're making!""  But people also said the same thing about GE back in the day.; Google in 2024 has made more money than Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and every other Fortune 500.

That suggests they are making the right moves.

Just think if they thought investing in the TPUs was a waste.; I didn't mention Microsoft because Microsoft has a more respectable dividend in my eyes at 0.8%; I prefer buybacks (rather than company keeping the money) since a lot can go to waste. Meta has somewhat addressed this but there was a period they were wasting shareholder money hand over fist on the metaverse. Alphabet has wasted tons on their “other bets”. Keep spending on R&D but reduce share count to increase value for shareholders. Buybacks are also more tax efficient.; yeah on an $1000 investment you'd only get around $5 back or less on these three stocks, which is painful; Buybacks are more tax efficient for the long term holder, especially those who are accumulating shares.; That was an amazing decision from you back then, well done. That's 500% return at least.; That's an achievement, seriously. When did you first buy in?; what's also interesting about Amazon is how red hot its share price growth is even with pretty minimal buybacks; Nvidia also went to the moon while not increasing dividend which meant the % got lower.; Nvidia does a 0.01% dividend to stay in dividendd funds. The more important thing they do is stock buy backs at the same time (15 bil a quarter)

Making money on nvidia is about selling covered calls which are extremely lucrative.; NVDA pays basically the lowest dividend possible, I believe it’s one penny per quarter, for inclusion in mutual funds that require dividends from their holdings. ; He certainly earned it with all the monkey dancing he did; Per year! He got a billion dollars in dividends in just one year!; That fool doesn't deserve a penny there's a reason why Ballmer era as CEO of Microsoft is often known as the dark ages for the company; Share buybacks would have been better since they're more tax efficient; Lol you're going to hurt some feelings saying that here. Most investors don't understand what you said.; Fair point.

I'm not holding any stock that I think is overvalued.; I cannot think of a reason why it wouldn't boost share price.  Amazon not paying a .01% dividend so it can get a nearly-free price boost actually irritates me.; If you’re buying $100 worth yes; Not meaningless to a patient investor.  If I put $10,000 in a 0.5% payer today, and they grow the dividend 10%/yr for 35 years, I am then getting $1,600/yr, or a 16% yield to cost.  

Giving investors a steady and increasing flow of income is attractive to long term holders, and can encourage them to hold the stock as they don't need to sell to get a tangible benefit from those shares.; Not to a CEO. That divi check pays for their lifestyle ; > All of those ~~0.03-0.08%~~ are meaningless

All dividends are irrelevant, period.  At least on the investor side.; A higher dividend doesn't make it a better choice for the business, though. It makes it a worse choice, even.; The other bets contain Waymo and Quantum Computing which could both bring major cashflows in. Calling it a waste is a bit too early to judge.

Furthermore, it doesn’t really make sense to buy back the stock if it is expensive, you may as well pay out a dividend; Meta is still burning cash; The problem with buybacks is that history has long shown that businesses are just as terrible investors as the average retail investor.

i.e. buybacks in the S&P500 are at their highest at the market peaks (when the average stock is most expensive), and buybacks are at their lowest after a recession/market crash, when the average stock is at it's cheapest.

Very few businesses are smart like Berkshire Hathaway in only doing buybacks when their own stock is cheap.; Thats what 0.5% lol.  You might as well risk it on Penny Stocks at that point. You would see a better return; The IPO crashed and burned, and I like buying on bad news, disappointments, mergers the market hates.  It's more than 3000% according to WFA.

I stand corrected with the drop in past few sessions it is down to 2956.63% up.; Buybacks and dividends go against their company philosophy. They still hold true to Bezos’ first shareholder letter “Day one”. They increase revenue and use that money to increase revenue even further. Buybacks and dividends would be a departure from that philosophy. Eventually they will shift to being more of a “mature” company but they still have the startup mentality.; Covered calls meant you lost out on a ton of upside over the past 2 years, and you also are risking downside if Nvidia stock crashes; This guy thetas.; DEVELOPERS....DEVELOPERS ...DEVELOPERS!; oh i know, i've come accross /r/dividends before.  the level of delusion is hilarious.; I trust amazon to generate higher returns on their free cash flow than to issue a dividend.; Hey, if you have 10k worth of it, you may be able to enjoy a nice evening at the movies with that dividend!; Yes. Still in order to get X from 0.08% you would be better off investing in something as stable but pays 1.5-3% using the same amount of investment money for a far higher payout; What if you take those 10K and put it into a 2.6% payer (dividend king); What an example did you pick ;-); not true, I've put my university tuition in some stable dividend-yielding stocks and I've been getting an approximate 10% annual yield from it. If I were to have put it in a high interest savings account (5-5.5%), I would have lost a lot of additionally generated capital. ; If the business passes cash to shareholders, that is not a bad thing. 

Also, as others have pointed out, if paying a nominal dividend opens up that stock to be purchased by funds and ETF’s that can only buy dividend stocks per their strategy, it increases the possible ownership base.; but if you're going to implement a dividend, you might as well make it high enough to be meaningful, but I understand what you mean; Is it?  At the end of the day a business is worth the present value of its future dividends; > Furthermore, it doesn’t really make sense to buy back the stock if it is expensive

Nobody knows for sure at the time whether a stock is “expensive”; Yes both could generate returns but other bets hasn’t delivered value in 20 years. Search, cloud, YouTube is what has been driving the company. They’ve wasted a ton of money.; I agree.; Companies are not meant to be stock pickers - they are meant to optimize their capital structure.  They have extra capital when the company does well, which will tend to correspond to periods of higher stock prices.  When the company is doing poorly and has little free cash flow, it will tend to be a at a lower price, but it doesn't have the cash to buy back stock.  

We shouldn't want companies to hold on to cash on the speculation that its stock price will dip in the future - they should manage their balance sheets based on current conditions, and let the market value them.; also the thing Meta and Google do differently than Apple is that Apple's share count has dropped substantially since a decade ago, whilst Meta and Google's share price has stagnated because the latter two do so much dilution from stock based comp.; You’re forgetting that the companies are still growing and their stock prices will appreciate over time; You're free to reinvest the money back into the same stock, or to use it to buy some other stock that you think is a better deal.

Dividends are the best use of cash when a stock is expensive and they can't effectively reinvest it to grow their business. If a stock was trading at a 100+ PE ratio, and less then a 1% free cash flow yield and yet they were spending billions of dollars on share buybacks I'd be pretty pissed at their management for wasting that money if I were an investor.; I appreciate AMZN not having a dividend. 

However, I also see Jassy as bringing the company to profitability by cutting expenses. I see the dividend as an eventuality.; That is not how covered calls work. 

For example when I did nvidia covered calls I’d sell weeklies until it hit my sell price ($145) when it finally did hit $145 I sold a atm call for $9 for 45 days out. This gave me $9 of upside protection or $9 of downside protection.  If at expiry nvidia was at $170 I could buy it back for $25 or let it go. If nvidia after it hit $145 the price started falling to $132 I could cash out for a ~70% profit and reissue at another strike or hold it. 


Like you said above covered calls do have a weakness, if the price were to fall or rise  more than $9 my position would be negative, but I’m not buying a stock that I think has huge downside potential, I believe in the company long term.

I’m currently selling covered calls on IWM, KO and SMCI.; Do you realize how small of a dividend allows a company's inclusion into ""dividend"" Etfs?

NVIDIA paid out like 200 million (.009 cents a share) ...; You could have just sold the equivalent amount worth of stock; I think unless you have a super high capital account, you’re better off with a higher return on a stock like Nvidia or google then counting on a dividend payment on something like Ford.

I’m learning all this on my own, so maybe you can convince me  otherwise.; Then you probably get 5-7% annual increase in dividends, and after 35 years, you are earning about the same in dividends, but you have less capital appreciation on the underlying shares.; It's a bad thing if the business can generate a higher return on investment by using that cash themselves. That's why I disagree with pretty much all of the Mag7's distributions except for Apple.; Tell me you think it‘s a good idea for Microsoft to liquidate and pay out the biggest dividend of its life. Or less extreme, to cut all R&D and all capex whatsoever just to juice its dividend.

Yeah, it‘d be stupid. The point of growth is for the business to reinvest and grow its cash flows, that‘s why I‘m paying 30x earnings.; >Is it? At the end of the day a business is worth the present value of its future ~~dividends~~ cash flow; Management should have a good idea, because if not they will allocate capital poorly; Yeah, they should stop working on transformative technologies to advance our species and instead focus on making better advertisements. Alphabet needs more geniuses like yourself working there because you’re clearly smarter than all of them!; Management teams getting paid millions with the job of capital allocation should absolutely be thinking about valuation when deciding whether buybacks make sense. 

“Can you imagine somebody going out and saying, we’re going to buy a business and we don’t care what the price is? You know, we’re going to spend $5 billion this year buying a business, we don’t care what the price is. But that’s what companies do when they don’t attach some kind of a metric to what they’re doing on their buybacks.”

\- Warren Buffett; Alphabet shares outstanding have been dropping since 2018 by about 13%. That’s less than the ~25% for Apple over that time, but calling it stagnant doesn’t seem appropriate: https://m.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOGL/alphabet/shares-outstanding; They’ve been profitable since Bezos; Should go back to talking to your wife about that ¯\_(ツ)_/¯; I still think the company retaining their cash flows for reinvestment would provide a greater return than issuing a dividend for the sake of being included in a dividend ETF to be bought up.; Ah not trying to convince you, it’s all personal experience. I personally rather see some returns today than pump the stock for Nvidia CEO so that he can sell at the highest high and leave the bag for me to hold hoping one day I will become rich. Only exception if you bought NVDA when it was dirt cheap then you win anyway; Fair enough, but who can be confident enough that the growth stock with the 0.5% payer will keep growing for 35 years? Especially if the stock is probably overvalued ATM; Disagree. It doesn’t need to be one or the other. These companies are swimming in cash and can do it all. Increasing the ownership base through ETF’s is in no way bad for shareholders; Like more buybacks? Look at Google who could have easily self funded Waymo but instead they took outside investment. ; Which is paid out to shareholders how?; Other Bets has lost $40b over the past decade. Luckily the geniuses there are putting their smarts to good use.; That just isn't what I stated - they are attaching a metric to it, that's what the capital allocation decision is for - if the expected return is too low on a buyback, a company will generally issue a dividend instead; what they aren't doing is trying to bottom tick the stock price.; Perhaps the situation has improved recently. It was an article I read a few months ago, it was examining the three companies share count from 2012-2022 or 2013-2023; Let's say it's only 100 million (I think the requirement is actually lower, but I'll be generous).  2-3% of the stock market is in dividend-only ETFS.

Even a .1% increase in the stock value as a result of a new slate of Etfs buying Amazon is worth over two billion dollars to shareholders.

**You don't need to believe me ... some random guy on the internet.  Multiple mega cap companies have publicly admitted that this is why they pay out an otherwise pointlessly small dividend.; Dividends are not free money and you shouldn’t count them as “return”; Well, they probably wanted to spread the risk; Share buybacks, by reinvesting it back into the business to generate higher cash flows, etc. Either way, it's reflected in the share price. Besides, the stock price is lowered by the stock exchange on the ex-dividend date anyways. Therefore, had the company not issued a dividend, you could have sold shares/a fractional share to give yourself a dividend. It's just math and logic.; And just one of those bets is now valued at $45B and will completely transform the transportation industry. It doesn’t take a genius to see it is paying off.; Holding cash because a stock is expensive isn’t bottom ticking, it’s prudent patience. Sometimes the market does a lousy job of valuation. Here’s what Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan had to say:

”Buying back stock of a financial company greatly in excess of two times tangible book is a mistake. We aren't going to do it.""

”I've been quite clear that I think things -- the future could be quite turbulent and asset prices in my view... are inflated. I don't know if they're extremely inflated or a little bit, but I prefer to wait.”

”Cash is a very valuable asset sometimes in a turbulent world. And you see my friend Warren Buffett stockpiling cash right now. I mean, people should be a little more thoughtful about how we're trying to navigate in this world and grow for the long-term for our company.”; In the earlier 2010s Alphabet and Meta really had stagnated while Apple dropped so the difference is larger if you extend further back. It just hasn’t really been as true for the past 6-7 years.; Could be the case. I don't see why it would be beneficial for a company to get unnecessarily juiced up higher than its intrinsic value though.; I think the people running Amazon know what they're doing compared to you lol; Your argument is as known and famous as the Statue of Liberty. Depending on what type of investor you are this claim is either true or false.
I will not even try to get into this; A stock being worth the present value of its future dividends is a principle taught in Accounting 101 textbooks.  It’s universally true; lol other megacaps have made the same calculus lol some companies have executives that don't want to pay income taxes on dividends and that distorts decision-making lol; No, it literally doesn’t matter what type of investor you are. All a dividend does is move a dollar from the company’s balance sheet into your pocket. There’s no new wealth being generated so the share price drops by the amount of the dividend since the company is now worth less.

In other words, if you own one share of a stock trading at $10 and it pays you a $1 dividend, you do NOT now have $11. Instead, you own one share of the stock now worth $9, and $1 in cash. Your net worth is still $10, nothing has changed. And if this stock is in a taxable account, now you have to pay taxes on the $1 so technically your net worth actually decreased.; Where are dividends paid out of?; Amazons board of directors and management team > Overlord1317


Indisputable ; I knew why I said that I do not want to get into it. all is good buddy, we are all different people.. maybe I am just ignorant.

Some people just think everybody who think differently is in the wrong."

I am curious about how the returns looked for 2022.; lost 1k on options and quit. made a couple hundo k in my long stocks; $50.; Dumb post. Thought WSB is about big losses or big wins. This is neither. Oh you beat the market slightly for one year? Clap, clap, clap.; I think the keyword missing here is *""consistency""* ![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787)

It is an objective fact most day traders are not beating annual returns of SPY, so in that comparison they're losing money; ""consistently"" or ""in the long term"" is the key part of the phrase you're missing. Everybody has the years where he's a genius outperforming the market. Now do that for 20 years, and you'll find why virtually nobody beats the market trading often for many years.; Love the optimism. Link looks interesting though. Good luck to all the winners out there making bank in '24!; 2024 was great year, could have even been better with a bit more luck. If 2025 goes half that good I'm golden, so fingers fucking crossed. But I have bad feeling for my returns this year 👀; I did aight, don't really do options yet.  Been playing around in the mining sector and have found some good companies with pretty reliable seasonal earnings, I just trade the cycle in longs.

5,Bitcoin Isn’t Unique But Infinite—$100K Is Beyond Absurd,"Imagine this: air, the most abundant and freely available resource on Earth. Everyone can breathe it without restriction, it’s everywhere, and it costs nothing. Now, imagine a company decides to package this air into bottles, claiming, “Only 21 million bottles will ever exist.” They sell the bottles, marketing them as rare and special, and soon, the price of a single bottle soars to $100,000.

But here’s the catch: anyone can grab the same air, bottle it themselves, impose their own arbitrary limits, and sell it too. The air inside these bottles is identical, same purity, same ability to sustain life. Yet somehow, the original company convinces people their air is unique, while the others are dismissed as worthless. This isn’t just absurd but comically irrational. And yet, it’s a perfect analogy for Bitcoin.

Think about it: bottling air to sell is ridiculous. Why would anyone pay for something that is freely and infinitely available? Worse, imagine dedicating an entire decentralized system—one consuming massive amounts of electricity, requiring complex networks, and involving global participants—to package, transfer, and store this bottled air. This is the level of absurdity we reach with Bitcoin.

Bitcoin’s defenders often point to its decentralization, anonymity, and capped supply of 21 million coins as reasons for its value. But what is this decentralized system really securing? Digital air. The units being produced, transferred, and protected represent nothing—they are infinitely replicable tokens that anyone can create at any time. Anyone with the technical knowledge can clone Bitcoin’s code, impose their own arbitrary cap, and launch their own cryptocurrency.

This brings us to the critical difference between Bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies) and other financial assets like stocks or fiat currencies: cryptocurrencies represent nothing and are inherently limitless.

Stocks represent ownership in a company. A company cannot be copied like a piece of code. The value of a share is tied to the performance, assets, and operations of that unique entity. You cannot clone Tesla or Apple, and therefore, you cannot duplicate the value tied to their stocks. Stocks are inherently scarce because companies themselves are finite, tied to real-world assets, operations, and innovation.

Fiat currencies, on the other hand, represent units of debt. They are issued by central banks and commercial banks through loans and bonds based on the ability of borrowers—companies, governments, or individuals—to repay them. Banks cannot create money infinitely because it is tied to the real-world capacity of debtors to meet their obligations. No one can walk into a bank and request a trillion-dollar loan without collateral or a realistic ability to repay it.

Cryptocurrencies operate under no such constraints. If you wanted to create a trillion crypto tokens tomorrow, nothing stops you. Bitcoin’s 21 million coin cap is arbitrary and meaningless because anyone can copy the Bitcoin protocol, adjust the parameters, and produce trillions of coins in their own system. In this way, cryptocurrencies represent nothing—no ownership, no debt, no tangible connection to the real economy. They are the digital equivalent of bottling air, infinitely replicable with no inherent value.

Bitcoin’s defenders argue that its capped supply makes it valuable, likening it to gold. But unlike gold, Bitcoin’s scarcity is artificial and replicable. Limiting Bitcoin to 21 million units is no different than bottling air and claiming, “We’re only producing 21 million bottles.” The air is still abundant, and anyone else can create their own bottles with their own arbitrary limits.

The absurdity deepens when you consider the massive resources dedicated to securing, transferring, and storing these digital tokens. Bitcoin mining consumes more electricity than entire nations, and yet what is being protected? A digital representation of air, something freely available, infinitely replicable, and ultimately meaningless.

Bitcoin’s price doesn’t reflect the value of its features. If decentralization, anonymity, and security were truly valuable, Bitcoin’s clones, many of which improve on these features, would share its valuation. Instead, Bitcoin’s price is fueled by speculation and the collective illusion that it is unique. People aren’t paying $100,000 because Bitcoin is the best cryptocurrency; they’re paying because they believe someone else will pay more.

This speculative bubble cannot last. Once people recognize that Bitcoin’s features are infinitely replicable, and that its competitors offer the same or better functionality at a fraction of the cost, the illusion will collapse.

Bitcoin isn’t digital gold, nor is it a revolutionary asset. It’s a digital air, packaged and sold as rare and valuable despite being infinitely and freely available. Paying $100,000 for a single Bitcoin is not a testament to its worth but evidence of a collective delusion. The elaborate decentralized system supporting Bitcoin exists to secure and transfer something that anyone can recreate endlessly at no cost.

When the hype fades, and the absurdity of the system becomes clear, Bitcoin’s price will plummet, leaving behind the inescapable truth: no rational person should pay a fortune for something as abundant and meaningless as digital air.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hqy8vw/bitcoin_isnt_unique_but_infinite100k_is_beyond/,0,2025-01-01 08:36:43,"One of the better analogies I’ve come across to counter your argument is that I could copy instragram (or another social network) tomorrow, but if nobody uses it is is worthless. 

Bitcoin has value because of the massive digital networking effect. The global consensus appears to be that people value Bitcoin as the number one digital currency / asset, and therein lies a key component of the value. 

You could argue that people might decide another digital asset should be more valuable, but to change the views of hundreds of millions of people/ possibly billions of users is akin to trying to get a supertanker to turn on a dime - it’s just extremely hard to fathom and therefore your argument does not apply. You cannot just ‘bottle other air’ and it become valuable as millions / billions of people think the original air is valuable. 

I would be interested in your counter to this value through digital networking effect argument.; If what you believe is true, then anyone could create a replacement that would achieve similar value and that just isn't happening.

What makes bitcoin unique is that it has enough participants to work as advertised and every participant chose it. It's not the default.; I feel like the same thing gets posted every 3 months for the last 10 years and nothing changes; Thank you for your unoriginal thoughts 10 years after I heard them for the first time; So, do it.

1. Download the open source Bitcoin software.
2. Change the name to what you want. 
3. Start mining it. 

See what happens.

Don't you think that if it were that easy, someone would have done it? Several attempts have been made.; ""You can't use paper for money - anyone could print that; it's intrinsically worthless!""

That was also correct at one time. Financial systems evolve, it's just that the time constants are measured in decades or centuries. Fun exercise: how many currencies exist today in their rough same form as 200 years ago -- and now, how many of those have governments that exist in the same form now as 200 years ago?  It's a small list; governments and currencies are ephemeral too with long enough time scales.; Go to bed; OP needs to study the history of money, network effects, internet protocols, computer science and encryption, precious metal stock/flow valuations, Austrian vs Keynesian economics, bitcoin itself, etc etc…. So much to do. So much to do!

They seriously think some central issuer bottling and selling air is akin to bitcoin. 😂 since this is an investment post, I sincerely hope no one takes this seriously; It costs electricity to make Bitcoin.; You sound so salty OP, if you hate it so much, why do you even care 😅, sounds like Bitcoin lives in your head rent free.; Thanks or sorry that happened!; You wrote this whole story based on your opinion and no facts.  Actually trashing BTC for no good reason from what I can see.  BTC is bulletproof, you can’t hack it or clone it as you claim.; So are Pokémon cards, but that’s not stopping kids and their dumbass parents from slurping up those nearly limitless printed trading cards.

Hell, the way 25yo kids are dropping $1000’s on Pokémon cards and even travelling to Japan to buy them makes BTC look really good in comparison.; \>This speculative bubble cannot last. Once people recognize that Bitcoin’s features are infinitely replicable

  
or once we get a real bear market. bitcoin in its speculative form has never seen one that hasn't been extremely V-shaped. when broad market indexes are down 30-70% and unemployment peaks hard what do you think magic internet money is going to be sitting at?

  
there's an absolute crap load of speculation in the market and it is not specific to crypto; Lots of very uninformed takes here, OP.

You might want to fact check yourself. You have a lot to learn about bitcoin and crypto in general.; [removed]; Bitcoin at 100k is a good time to sell, not to buy, I'm fine with that. Rest of your take is just wrong. You can create millions of company if you wanna, but none of them will replicate the value of Apple or Tesla, same with Bitcoin. You can create Bitcoin-copycat but you still need to spend an absurd amount of energy which cost shitton of real-life electricity and specialised computer to get one of those 21 million Bitcoin (or pay 100k for it) while none of your copycat will replicate the value of Bitcoin.; A useful way to test your thinking is to copy paste this into chat GPT and ask it to role play as a bitcoin proponent to counter the arguments. 

You can try even sth stronger like “don’t stop our convo until you’ve convinced me of its utility” 

Would be interested in your experience and any counter arguments to its counter arguments!; The fact that everyone measure the value of bitcoin in dollars should make you think about what they want, more bitcoin or more dollars?; I think Buffett's take on Bitcoin is perfect.  Much as you say.; [deleted]; I pretty much agree that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value (well maybe except for money laundering). But it doesn’t mean you can’t have a 3% speculative position. If it goes up, nothing to lose. If it goes down, not a big deal.; Your analogy comparing Bitcoin to social networks like Instagram is flawed because it conflates functional digital platforms with empty digital tokens.

Instagram posts and pictures aren’t empty units. They are creative outputs that hold intrinsic value to their creators and audiences. Social networks like Instagram or Facebook provide tangible value through features like communication, connection, and content sharing. Users create and consume content that enhances their personal and professional lives. This isn’t comparable to Bitcoin, which doesn’t produce anything. Its tokens don’t represent assets, creative works, or tangible utilities.

Further, social networks generate revenue, and you can invest in that revenue stream. Platforms like Instagram and Facebook make money through advertising, providing a clear business model. If you own stock in Meta you get access to dividends or share price appreciation tied to the company’s performance. Bitcoin, by contrast, has no revenue, no dividends, no underlying asset, and no utility beyond speculation. It’s an empty vessel propped up by hype and collective belief, not by any productive system.

The network effect doesn’t justify Bitcoin’s value. The so-called “massive digital networking effect” of Bitcoin doesn’t produce utility the way social networks do. Instagram’s network is valuable because users are creating content, sharing ideas, and driving engagement, which in turn attracts advertisers. Bitcoin’s network, on the other hand, exists solely to secure and trade a token that represents nothing. Its network effect is built on speculation and circular reasoning: people value Bitcoin because other people value Bitcoin. This doesn’t make it inherently valuable, it just makes it a bigger bubble.

The air analogy still holds. Even if billions of people believe Bitcoin is valuable, that doesn’t change the fact that what they’re trading is infinitely replicable digital air. The illusion of scarcity doesn’t make the underlying token any more meaningful. Bottling air and convincing people it’s unique might work temporarily, but it doesn’t change the fact that air is all around us, free and infinite.

Changing mass belief is hard, but not impossible. Markets have turned against ‘indestructible’ narratives before. Tulip mania, the South Sea Bubble, and even tech bubbles all involved massive numbers of people believing in the value of something, only for the belief to collapse when reality set in. Bitcoin is no different as its value is based on collective belief, not on any intrinsic qualities. When people start to realize this, the network effect will collapse just like any other speculative bubble.; If Bitcoin’s value truly stemmed from something unique, its adoption might make sense. But the reality is that Bitcoin isn’t special; it’s just the first cryptocurrency to gain traction. The claim that ""anyone could create a replacement"" is true and they already have. Bitcoin has been cloned countless times, and the only reason these clones don’t have the same value is that Bitcoin benefits from first-mover hype, not because it’s fundamentally different.

Participants “choosing” Bitcoin doesn’t make it unique either. It just means people latched onto the first major cryptocurrency they encountered. What they’re choosing is still digital air, tokens that represent nothing, can be copied infinitely, and offer no intrinsic value. The fact that a large network secures Bitcoin doesn’t justify wasting resources on something that’s abundant and pointless. Popularity doesn’t make absurdity rational, it just makes it widespread.; Still a pyramid scheme.; And each time with a much higher number.

And then it goes into a slump on much higher level than before, and people are like “I told you so” and then goes to a new ATH 2-3 years later. And we are for sure gonna hear the same when it is gonna slump around 2026-2027.

If you can wrong for 16 years, maybe there is so something you are missing.; It will change and people will loose lots of money. People will live saying “ I’m glad I sold at $100,000” bitcoin or any crypto isn’t real money and not backed by anything. Crypto is trash; Also just wrong. You can’t create more bitcoin without getting EVERYONE running the network to agree- good luck with that 👍; You are missing the fundamental point: just because people irrationally prefer one brand of bottled air over another doesn’t change the fact that what’s being sold is still just air.

To your points:

1)Downloading the Bitcoin code, renaming it, and starting a new network isn’t difficult. Plenty of people have done it. That’s exactly how we got countless cryptocurrencies. The fact that these clones exist proves my point: Bitcoin can be and has been replicated repeatedly.

2)The reason these clones don’t reach Bitcoin’s level of popularity isn’t because they’re fundamentally different or less secure. It’s because Bitcoin had the advantage of being the first to market, and its brand is propped up by hype, speculation, and a network effect. People irrationally cling to the idea that Bitcoin is unique, but this belief doesn’t change the fact that Bitcoin’s core features like decentralization, anonymity, and scarcity or the units themselves are infinitely replicable.

3)The idea that ‘several attempts have been made’ and failed doesn’t make Bitcoin’s system or value logical. It simply shows how strong the collective delusion around Bitcoin’s brand is. If you bottle air and convince people it’s special, and they refuse to buy from anyone else despite identical alternatives, that doesn’t make your product inherently valuable, it just highlights how irrational the buyers are.

At the end of the day, whether people buy Bitcoin or not doesn’t change the fact that what’s being secured, mined, and traded is effectively digital air, units that represent nothing. They are infinite and freely replicable via clones. It's fundamentally absurd to waste resources on something like that.; [removed]; The analogy between fiat money and Bitcoin falls apart because fiat money isn’t “intrinsically worthless” in the same way Bitcoin is. Fiat represents debt, an obligation backed by collateral, creditworthiness, and the productive capacity of individuals, companies, and governments. When a bank issues fiat currency through loans, it’s tied to real-world assets and obligations, ensuring a connection to the economy. You can’t simply “print” fiat without consequences because it’s tied to the ability of debtors to repay it.

Bitcoin, however, represents nothing. It isn’t backed by debt, collateral, or any real-world asset. Anyone can create a cryptocurrency from scratch and assign an arbitrary supply cap, but that doesn’t make it valuable. Its supposed “scarcity” is artificial because the concept can be infinitely copied.

While financial systems evolve, that evolution is tied to systems of accountability and value. Fiat currency evolved as a way to efficiently represent and exchange debt obligations tied to real assets. Bitcoin lacks this foundation entirely. Suggesting Bitcoin is comparable to fiat money overlooks the critical difference: fiat is grounded in the real debt obligations, while Bitcoin is unbacked speculation on digital air.; I have heard that its price represents the total value of the electricity that has created it. Interesting take.; Sure, it costs electricity to make Bitcoin, just like it would cost electricity to bottle, store, and transfer air. But that doesn’t make the process any less absurd. Air is all around us, freely available. Using electricity to package it into bottles doesn’t give it value but just shows how wasteful the process is.

The same applies to Bitcoin. What is being ‘created,’ ‘stored,’ and ‘transferred’ via this decentralized system is nothing but digital air, units that represent nothing, can be copied infinitely via clones and are no different from countless crypto units anyone can make.; [removed]; When broad market indexes are down 30-70% I will sell my semen for ETFs; Bitcoin has never seen a real bear market?; if i had the energy to edit this, id also comment the following statement “sorry for your loss”

it’s clear this was written out of spite. 

happy new year, loser.; The comparison between Bitcoin and companies like Apple or Tesla is flawed because it ignores the fundamental difference: companies produce goods and services, while Bitcoin is just an empty digital token.

Companies like Apple and Tesla create value through innovation, tangible products, and real-world economic impact. Their stocks represent ownership in a business that generates revenue and profit. This value can’t be easily replicated because the companies are backed by patents, infrastructure, and a workforce that can’t be copy-pasted.

Bitcoin, on the other hand, produces nothing. Its value isn’t tied to any utility or economic output. It’s purely speculative. Yes, it costs electricity to mine Bitcoin, but burning energy to create something doesn’t automatically make it valuable. If you spend a fortune mining digital air, all you have is expensive digital air. Bitcoin’s value doesn’t come from its energy consumption; it comes from people speculating that others will pay more for it later.

As for your point about copycats, Bitcoin clones already exist but their lack of adoption only highlights how irrational the market is, not Bitcoin’s uniqueness. Just because people irrationally value one brand of bottled air over others doesn’t change the fact that what’s being bought and sold is still just air. Bitcoin isn’t a productive asset, it’s a bubble, and the fact that it costs a lot to mine doesn’t make it any less absurd.; Gold used to be sold in salt, until everyone learned that it was a better store of value. We measure it in usd because it is what everyone else still believes is the best store of value. Might I recommend ""Shelling Out"" by Nick Szabo?; I actually track my networth in dollar and in btc . The sad reality is while I double it in 3 years in dollars, I got poorer in bitcoin.; [Naval in 2017](https://x.com/naval/status/939316447318122496?t=IXQApdb8Y2m4_RJeXDv89g&s=19); Beauty.; We build rockets to go into space while people in north America don't have drinking water or a roof over their head and billionaires who don't pay taxes.

But go ahead be mad about the increasingly sustainable energy usage.; Remember, past results always indicate future performance; >Bitcoin can be and has been replicated repeatedly.

And they're all worthless because they're not decentralized or secure. You making your own coin doesn't mean you have the ability to secure billions of dollars as BTC and ETH do.

>2)The reason these clones don’t reach Bitcoin’s level of popularity isn’t because they’re fundamentally different or less secure

No, that's exactly why. Do you trust a network with 1000s of nodes around the world and validators securing billions of dollars worth, or do you trust the network with one node created you securing nothing?

>what’s being secured, mined, and traded is effectively digital air, units that represent nothing. They are infinite and freely replicable via clones. It's fundamentally absurd to waste resources on something like that.

These ""digital units"" are money for the protocol. It's the only way to utilize the blockspace that is produced by the network. This blockspace is in fact in great demand and people have paid billions annually to utilize it. This same blockspace produced by Ethereum and Bitcoin is settling more value than PayPal, Amex, and MasterCard.

 Who would use an exact Bitcoin clone when all of the security and liquidity and trading volume are on the main chain? That doesn't invalidate bitcoin. That's the beauty of an open source protocol. The market has decided that a few main chains are the ones with all of the liquidity and the rest are dead.

But adding ""real"" allows for the poster to move the goalposts if they're pressed about it.; correct. 2018 2020 and 2022 were all extremely v shaped recoveries, nothing remotely long if you look at similar poor market conditions historically; Not really no. QE kicked the can on the 2020 crash; Bitcoin blockchain produce expensive block where place to write data that are protected against any change is sold. What's priced is its security amd integrity. You cannot overwrite on the Bitcoin blockchain without spending a tons in material and energy. Other Bitcoin copycat weren't able to produce that level of security and integrity, which is part of its uniqueness. 

The data being written is mostly financial data (transaction). The aim of Bitcoin is to be a decentralized ledger, which is working as intended for the past 15 years. A whole ecosystem is being born from that piece of code: some merchants allow payment in crypto, it's used as legal tender in some 3rd world country, etc.

The only other cryptocurrency that are able to compete against Bitcoin, like Ethereum, have another aim than being a decentralized ledger, its to be a decentralized computer. 

It's absurdily priced up, especially in a bullmarket, and extremly unregulated (some token acts as shares of a company), but thinking it's completly worthless is also absurd too.; It can be said about anything. Even the S&P500, even though it has +100 years to back it up. Could enter WW3, very unlikely, but not impossible. Everything will come to at end at some point, even the S&P500.; The claim that Bitcoin’s value is tied to its security and liquidity is true on the surface, but it ignores the underlying absurdity: what is being secured and transacted is fundamentally meaningless. Let’s address your points systematically.

The argument that clones are worthless because they’re not decentralized or secure misses the bigger picture. Bitcoin’s decentralization and security protect nothing more than an entry in a ledger that tracks ownership of digital tokens. These tokens represent no real-world asset, no debt, no claim on productivity. It's just speculative value. Spending billions annually to secure something inherently worthless doesn’t make it valuable; it makes the system an extravagant waste of resources.

As for the comparison to payment networks like PayPal, Amex, or MasterCard, the distinction is clear: those systems facilitate transactions of fiat money, which is tied to real-world economies and debt. Bitcoin’s blockspace is used to transfer Bitcoin, a token that represents nothing. Settling billions of dollars in speculative value doesn’t create inherent worth. It's just a reflection of speculative trading volume, not economic utility.

The idea that no one uses clones because Bitcoin has all the liquidity and trading volume highlights a self-reinforcing bubble, not intrinsic value. Liquidity and trading volume exist because people speculate on Bitcoin, not because it provides superior utility or represents something valuable. The argument essentially boils down to popularity, which is not the same as legitimacy.

Finally, comparing Bitcoin’s market dominance to traditional businesses failing is flawed. In traditional finance, businesses fail because they can’t compete on innovation, efficiency, or value creation. In the crypto space, clones fail not because they’re less innovative or useful but because Bitcoin benefits from first-mover advantage and irrational speculation. The fact that people irrationally cling to the first brand of “digital air” doesn’t make Bitcoin more valid, but just makes the market collectively deluded.

Bitcoin’s supposed security and decentralization don’t justify its price because what’s being secured and decentralized is no more valuable than an infinite supply of digital air. The billions paid for blockspace reflect hype, not utility.; You are correct.; Your argument rests on the premise that Bitcoin’s security and integrity justify its price, but this misses the point: what’s being secured and stored on the blockchain is fundamentally worthless.

The Bitcoin blockchain is indeed secure and decentralized, but its main purpose is to protect data about transactions involving Bitcoin itself. Essentially, an elaborate system for keeping track of who owns a digital token that represents nothing. The blockchain’s immutability is impressive from a technical perspective, but it doesn’t add inherent value to the thing being tracked. It’s like spending a fortune on an unbreakable safe to protect an empty box.

The claim that Bitcoin’s uniqueness lies in its security also doesn’t hold up. Other cryptocurrencies have built blockchains with comparable or even superior levels of functionality and adoption, depending on the use case. Bitcoin’s so-called “uniqueness” is more a function of being first to market than offering unparalleled features.

As for its use as a decentralized ledger, the fact that Bitcoin has been working as intended for 15 years doesn’t mean it’s inherently valuable. A system can function perfectly while still solving a problem that doesn’t need solving. The idea of a decentralized ledger sounds appealing until you consider the inefficiency and absurdity of expending massive amounts of energy to protect a system that tracks digital tokens with no intrinsic worth.

Yes, Bitcoin has spawned an ecosystem, but much of it is speculative or based on the illusion of utility. Its use as legal tender in some countries is more about political posturing than practicality, as adoption rates remain low and most people still rely on fiat currencies.

Ultimately, Bitcoin’s price doesn’t stem from its security, utility, or decentralization. It’s driven by speculation and belief in its value. While it’s not ""completely worthless"" as a technology, its current valuation is detached from any meaningful economic utility. Bitcoin secures digital air, and no amount of energy consumption or technical brilliance changes that fact.; And the S&P500 consisted of completely different companies back then; They are speculating on the ""potential"" of the next big thing. If it wasn't crypto it would  be something else.; Yup, the whole US economy has to sink and never recover. Very very unlikely, but nothing is impossible.; That's not true for bitcoin, though.

6,Best AI stocks to invest in 2025,"Hello

I am new to stock market and was wondering what AI stocks are a better investment?NVDA and AMAZON is something I have invested a bit.But was wondering if it makes sense to put more into it or are there any other stocks out there which makes more sense to invest in. Was also thinking MS and Apple but I am not sure if they have already reached their limits and not really sure what 2025 has for these. NVDA exploded in 2024 and not sure how that can contribute for 2025. Never really been a favorite of Alphabet and Meta is very expensive. I am asking for advice keeping the next 3 years in mind for now. Any expert insights is much appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1hqo2oy/best_ai_stocks_to_invest_in_2025/,39,2024-12-31 22:07:58,"I would look at NVDA, AMD, GOOG, META, AMZN, and MSFT. 

My thesis is that when AI starts to explode, it’s going to be the mega caps that end up stealing the spotlight.; This is an easy one.   The company that will most likely win the AI wars and benefit is Google.


Search will go to agents and there is nobody better positioned than Google to win the agent space.

There is no company that has anywhere near the reach that Google enjoys.

Take cars. Google now has the largest car maker in the world, VW, GM, Ford, Honda a bunch of others ones now using Android Automotive as their vehicle OS. Do not confuse this with Android Auto. Google will just put Astra in all these cars. Compare this to OpenAI that has zero access to automobiles.

Same story with TVs. Google has Hisense, TCL, Samsung and a bunch of other TV manufactures using Google TV as their TV OS. Google will have all these TVs get Astra. Compare this to OpenAI that has zero on TVs.

Then there is phones. The most popular OS in the world is Android. Google has over 3 billion active devices running Android and they will offer Astra on all of these phones. Compare this to OpenAI that does not even have a phone operating system.

Then there is Chrome. The most popular browser. Compare this to OpenAI that does not have a browser. Google will be offering Astra built into Chrome.

But that is really only half the story. The other is Google has the most popular applications people use and those will be fully integrated into Astra.

So you are driving and Astra will realize you are close to being out of gas and will tap into Google Maps to give you the gas station ad right at the moment you most need it. Google will also integrate all their other popular apps like Photos, YouTube, Gmail, etc.

Even new things like the new Samsung Glasses are coming with Google Gemini/Astra built in.

There just was never really a chance for OpenAI. Google has basically built the company for all of this and done the investment to win the space.

The big question is what Apple will ultimately do? They are just not built to provide this technology themselves.

I believe that Apple at some point will just do a deal with Google where they share in the revenue generated by Astra/Gemini from iOS devices. Same thing they are doing with the car makers and TV makers.

They will need to because of how many popular applications Google has.

Astra will also be insanely profitable for Google. There is so many more revenue generation opportunities with an Agent than there is with just search.

BTW, it will also be incredibly sticky. Once your agent knows you there is little chance you are going to switch to a different one. This is why first mover is so important with the agent and why Google is making sure they are out in front with this technology.

Plus the agent is going to know you far better than anything there is today so the ads will also be a lot more valuable for Google.

The other thing that Google did that helps assure the win is spending the billions on the TPUs starting over a decade ago. Google is not stuck paying the massive Nvidia tax that OpenAI is stuck paying. Plus Google does not have to wait in the Nvidia line.

That is how Google can offer things like Veo2 for free versus OpenAI Sora

https://www.reddit.com/link/1hg6868/video/sopmwriocd7e1/player?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=OpenAI&utm_content=t3_1hg6868

Or how Google is able to offer Gemini Flash 2.0 for free. But this is a very common MO for Google. They offer this stuff for free and suck out all the money and hurt investment into competitors. Then once the competition is gone Google will bump up the ads and/or subscription price. Plus the fact that people are not going to want to switch Agents it will also allow Google to bump up the ads without losing material customers.

The other place Google just blows OpenAI away is in terms of research. Last NeurIPS Google had twice the papers accepted as next best.

Plus next best was NOT OpenAI. Google has led in papers accepted every single year over the last 10+ years.

Most years Google has been #1 and #2 as they use to breakout Deepmind from Google Brain.

OpenAI has NOT even registered and not been in the top 5 a single year.; It would be foolish to overlook Google.; NBIS - Nebius group; Less risky
- AMD
- NVDA
- MFST
- GOOG
- AMZN

These companies already have some things going, so they arent as risky. If you want lower risk, these could fit.

More risky
- SOUN
- AISP

SOUN and AISP are pretty good for short term trading, but they are still longterm candidates. If you want higher risk and more volatility, these stocks could work for you. These stocks are high risk high reward.; BBAI - I see them somewhat of a little brother of PLTR. BigBear AI have similar offerings to Palantir but are more specialised towards Cybersecurity, Border Control and Supply Chain logistics.

Recently, they've had a bit of a run up so I'm expecting them to drop before purchasing more.; Might unironically be shorting them next year, though I am bullish long term; NASDAQ? 😁; Two of my favorites honestly in Amazon and NVidia.  Nvidia grows faster and will through the end of 2026 for sure.  Amazon is steady but solid growth.  Both dominate their spaces.  NVDA is a very solid investment or trade until next earnings; AVGO; APLD is a hidden gem I found that builds datacenter and infrastructure for AI development. They are the contractor that get hired to design and construct data centers. I work for a top 10 ENR contractor and we collaborate a lot. Expecting them to get big once the demand for AI and data center rise even more.; INTC IS NOT AI 🤖???; AMD and Sound; INOD; Small caps.  I’m worried the overall SP500 is overvalued.  But fuck there’s no good small cap ai stock…; Sound hound daddy; BBAI and AISP; Qualcomm; Grrr gorilla tech; AI takes extreme amounts of energy to operate. Theres not enough infrastructure to power all these new AI platforms coming online.So make sure if you invest in an AI company’s that have partnered with energy companys.   Ex:Stocks . Built data centers next to and made agreement with energy producers. They are not going to shut down the grid for any AI company who does not have the infrastructure built.  Thats my opinion.; BBAI, the Palantir baby.
Still cheap and at the right time ; ASML anyone? Monopoly semiconductor equipment play; AMD, Meta, Google, Clov, Odd are undervalued; NVIDIA is a great company and will continue to make excellent profits ..but at the size it is, it would take a looong time for it to make another 100% from current price.

There are so so many other companies that will make 100% increase within a year ..is why I pulled out of NVIDIA.; Bbai; ai16z; NVDA for sure and yes still

I was thinking a very, very little percent.  Something less than 5%.; There are some that think OpenAI is a big competitor to Google.  I do not really see it but it is why I used OpenAI in comparison.

IMO, it really breaks down to consumer and enterprise.  Google will own consumer and Microsoft will continue to own enterprise.

In the end it is all about reach.  Nobody has anywhere near the reach Google enjoys with consumers.   #2 behind Google would be Apple.

With enterprise there is nobody with the reach Microsoft enjoys.; Anything below 200 is a good price, can easily go 300+ in the near future imo. Once AI gets more fully implemented and monetized it can lead to substantial profitability and justify a valuation of 500+; INTC is a comeback. It won't be bad to have some; I use to have PLTR in my portfolio, but I can’t justify there current valuation; Sorry, was talking about the ticker AI for C3 ai.; CYN is a disaster lately, I'd stay away; To me nvda is at a high price point now with limited upside. I see it's long term chart it's starting to come off the rail; Exactly, business as usual; They are primarily a software company.

I'm the exact opposite. I hate them and their products. But I'd be a fool to ignore them as a huge potential AI player. They are cautious in everything they do. They move slowly. But when they move, they move big."
7,Money Market Fund verses High Yield Savings Account,"As the title suggests, I am looking at the differences between HYSA and a money market for storing my savings. I recently acquired $5,500 from selling one of my cars and want to put that in savings but logistically what is the most practical option in case I need to pull out the money in the event of emergencies or whatever the case maybe if I need access to the funds quick. I do have a Schwab account and the ability to get a HYSA via my Apple Card. Or if there are other alternatives, I am open to them. Thanks! ",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hqimmw/money_market_fund_verses_high_yield_savings/,2,2024-12-31 17:46:30,"The downside to Schwab is there will be a slight delay in getting your money.  Unlike Fidelity and Schwab, your cash is going to be held in a sweep account that gets practically no interest.  If you want to put your savings in a money market account then the timing is exactly the same as any other mutual fund - you can only deposit and withdraw at the end of a business day.; If the situation you are planning for is the possibility of needing the funds same day, stick with a savings account.  If you are comfortable with a part of it being available in a day, put that part in a money market fund.; If you pay everything with a credit card for rewards, then pay it off at the end of the month.

Most “emergencies” can be paid for with credit and that gives you time to make the transfers. Even HYSA’s have a 2-5 day transfer window; Vanguard’s VMFXX or VMRXX; If I decide to switch to a money market, which one should I go with?; If I go with a money market, which one would be best? I reside in Texas with no state income tax; What’s the difference between them; Depends on your state income tax situation.  If it's on the high side then SNSXX is the best for that - it's pretty much all treasuries, so the interest will be exempt from state and local taxes.  

That being said, if 5500 is all you're putting in then you're looking at 200-250 dollars in interest, so it's not that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things.; Vanguard’s “sweep”  account (like an in/out buffer) stores funds in VMFXX, which is paying 4.4% (7 day yield).  I’ve moved a chunk to VMRXX since it’s paying 4.42%, but it takes an extra day to access that money.  I can have any of the money into my linked bank account in 2-3 work days; I reside in Texas"
8,DCA into SPY by selling puts? 250k never traded options before.,"Hi guys, I will try to give context to my whole situation while also keeping it brief.

After all income minus expenses (mortgage, other) I have a surplus of about 2-3k a month that I just collect in my bank. For the past few years it was just rotting in my BOA account, but recently I moved it to Robinhood so it atleast gets 4% now.

A few years ago I put 50k in GTE, sold it when it hit 65k. Had to pay taxes on the 15k. Then put the 65k into SDC. DCA’d when stock fell in half and put in another 50k. SDC went bankrupt so I lost 115k. Would be nice if I could tax harvest it some how.

Also this whole time I was not putting any money into 401k or Roth. A month ago filled up my Roth for the Robinhood bonus, and will deposit another 7k in a few days. And a few days ago I finally went to my HR portal and enabled max 401k. Why it took me this long, I don’t know.

Anyways, I already made every possible financial mistake, so I was just trying to make the final biggest one of all. Timing the market. That is why I let my savings balloon to 250k (even after the SDC loss) .

But I just read somewhere that selling puts of SPY is like DCA’ing plus you also get paid a premium.

As you can see, I am very financially illiterate, I’ve never traded options before, although I do have a Robinhood account, and I’m smart enough to know how to have a good job that pay wells. Can someone help me walk through this?

I understand that when I enter a contract to sell puts, I buy 100 shares of that stock at the current price. If the shares go up I am mandated to sell these shares at that price I bought them, and the buyer can take those shares and instantly sell them for the higher price. 

If the stock goes down however, than my option expires worthless, but I don’t care because I was hoping for that to happen if my goal was to DCA into SPY. I already bought the 100 shares. I just got paid the premium for giving someone an option to speculate on them.

I have a couple of questions, first when doing this option, is there a particularly security to choose? Like SPY or VOO or SPLG or just the stocks I want to invest in like, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google.

For example, I noticed SPY has a ton of dates for selling puts, whereas SPLG only has 5 possible dates, roughly 2-3 months apart.

My goal is to maximize bid price right? The lower you try to sell the put for, usually the lower the bid price. 
Also if I try to sell a put that expires in a few days, usually the bid price is a few dollars. A month away, it goes up to $10. But two months away, it doesn’t double to $20, it goes to around $12-$14. So that is why the most optimal puts are to buy the ones that are a month away. Because you collect the premium and can choose to invest into selling more puts again more quickly (if stock went up).

Should I try to care about limit order or market order?

Right now I’m looking at SPY, the current price is $588.70, and there is a put for $588 on Feb 21st with a bid price of $10.21

So irregardless, I make $1,021. If stock goes down, I was planning to DCA into SPY, so now I own 100 shares. If stock goes up, someone else makes more money. Since I have 250k, I can do this trade 4 times, and at the end of February, I either have 250k plus 4k, or I have 400 shares of SPY

I guess now the question becomes how do I maximize the bid price while not doing something crazy? What is the best strategy for this?

Plus I kinda do still believe in timing the market a little. I feel like there might be a sharp drop around end of Jan (Trump) and then we will probably trend downwards or sideways for a year or so. I’m curious if you guys agree or disagree or what are your market predictions. I feel like recession sentiment is growing, but I don't know how that correlates to an actual recession.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hqiahm/dca_into_spy_by_selling_puts_250k_never_traded/,0,2024-12-31 17:30:46,"Stop. you’re doing it again. 

Just buy the ETF you want to own (VTI is nice) and *forget about it*; [https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/spx/bondarenko-oleg-putwrite-putw-2019.pdf](https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/spx/bondarenko-oleg-putwrite-putw-2019.pdf)

Here is one study that compares put write indices to just the indices. Performance is comparable but lower standard deviation so supposedly lower risk. However, since performance is similar that means you're doing all that work to make no additional money. In addition, the premium you make will be taxed as short term capital gains, which means higher tax payment. I assume this also assumed optimal put writing with no mistakes, but because you're a beginner, mistakes are bound to happen so your return will be less.

  
Since it doesn't outperform most of the time, just invest in the index and call it a day.; Please just buy SPY or VTI and don’t play with options. Your description seems like you’re confusing what to do when you sell cash secured puts vs covered calls. Just buy shares and let it grow over time.; You are overcomplicating this, my man. Keep it simple. No need for options, etc.; Do not do options.; >I understand that when I enter a contract to sell puts, I buy 100 shares of that stock at the current price. If the shares go up I am mandated to sell these shares at that price I bought them, and the buyer can take those shares and instantly sell them for the higher price.

You're getting things mixed up a bit. By your title, you're talking about selling cash-secured puts. You agree to buy the stock at a certain price a certain time in the future. If the stock goes *down*, the person who bought the put will exercise it and sell the stock to you for more than it's currently worth.

This quote of yours is describing a covered *call*. You own the stock (or buy it for this purpose) and agree to sell it at a certain price/date. If the stock goes up, then the person who bought the call gets to buy the stock from you for less than it's worth.

Selling options is much less risky than buying them, as long as they're covered options (you have the cash to buy the underlying if you're selling puts and already own the stock you'd be selling if you're selling calls).

The primary risk with CSPs in the way you describe is if the stock rises in price above what you would've been happy to pay for it. You've likely made a small premium selling the put but don't own the stock and have then missed the more considerable price appreciation you would've enjoyed from simply buying it originally.; I don't think you fully understand the damage you are doing (and have already done) to your financial future. 

You say you invested $165K in 2 stocks, for a net loss of of $100K (not including taxes obviously). But do you know the *true* cost of that decision?

Let's say you had invested that $165K in the S&P 500 for 30 years and left it alone. Do you know how much money you'd have? Approximately $1.25 million (assuming an average annual return of 7%). 

Your gambling cost future you $1.25 MILLION. 

\---

Now, let's say you don't learn your lesson and end up blowing this $250K as well. Let's play out that scenario. 

  
$250K  invested in the S&P 500 + a monthly contribution of the $2K you say you have leftover each month = about $4.1 million after 30 years. 

  
YOU'D HAVE OVER $4 MILLION IN 30 YEARS IF YOU JUST BOUGHT SPY/VOO AND LEFT IT ALONE FOR DECADES. 

But I'm sure this SPY put buying strategy will work out great. Good luck with that.; Please call Fidelity. Work with an advisor. Give them your lump money, get an account where you can just deposit weekly and it automatically invests for you. Do you know how many years of management fees $115k is? The red flags on this post are crazy wild. Zero risk (not really, but that’s how people see it in bank account), to almost no risk. To yolo lose it all. To wild scheme in something you have never done before. Secure the bag first with a pro. Do some yolo on the side. That is a lot of money you are talking about. I would normally tell you to start slow, but your beginning point is so high already, that you will make more mistakes with that money. If you had a $250k car, would you pop the hood and start tinkering with the engine? Call a pro. Fidelity is great. Make sure you can deposit weekly into the management program, and do so (they tend to not be hungry since they charge so little). Good luck!; Sounds like you're just gambling on a risky stock to make money quick. Invest in safer indexes. Don't do options. ; Do not sell options without a very very good understanding of what you are doing. You can easily end up owing more than you could ever pay back in a single year. Do not get into options unless you know for sure what you are doing. Do not do this.; You can offset any future gains with that 115k loss if you included it in your tax filing for that year.  If you didn’t include it in your tax filing, you can probably amend your old tax return.; Sometime in the post around where OP lost $115k on a single stock that went bankrupt is about the time I figured OP isn’t cut out for gambling."
9,"Looking for Advice on investing USD $12,500","
Hi all,
I’m kind of new to stock market investing and need some advice.
I got $12,500 after tax bonus from work last week and am researching how & where to invest. 
Some details on my thinking are:
- Investment period 15 years
- US only investment, I know foreign markets have high growth potential but they have a lot of unpredictability which I’m not comfortable with.
- I would prefer more stable stocks like Amazon, Apple etc. but I am afraid I’m not looking at higher growth prospects. 
- My objective is to build a retirement portfolio, hence the 14 year period so value growth and dividend are both important.

Let me know if you guys need any other info, I would really appreciate any guidance.

The way they work is as a stock grows in value it rebalances to buy more of that stock - in effect buying high. 

When the stock drops in value it rebalances to sell that stock - in effect selling low. This is why I don't like indexes personally.

If tommorow is going to be more technologically advanced than today buy tech - everything else will underperform over the long term.; The fact you’re ready to start investing period is a good thing.

Find a stock that you can purchase 100 shares of. Buy the shares at a good price, maybe during the dips. Then sell covered calls. You essentially get a premium upfront on your shares that you can then further reinvest and you only “lose” your stocks by being forced to sell them at the strike price or in a better scenario the option expires worthless so you keep your premium.

It totally depends on what you want but by the time you have made any serious money you will likely be too old to enjoy it. I much prefer risky trades as you can sometimes earn years worth of compounding interest within a much shorter time frame. I worked out that if you put 20k in and held for 60 years it would be 1.1 mil which sounds good, but when you factor in inflation which in the uk was estimated at 2% annually, the purchasing power was only 300k, and you would likely be dead before then.

Index funds are importantly to have in your portfolio.; While it’s true that risky trades can sometimes offer faster returns, the S&P 500 has historically outpaced inflation over the long term, offering stability and compounding growth without the extreme volatility of high-risk assets. Sure, it might take decades to see massive gains, but for most people, steady growth in diversified investments like ETFs provides a safer path to building wealth. Crypto and other high-risk assets can be part of a portfolio, but they come with much higher chances of loss, especially for those who can’t afford to lose it all. Ultimately, balance is key.; “Alt season is on the way”

Nobody knows that for sure.; Mags is pretty good.; You have a fair point. I think your investment strategy is just relative to what you want, I don’t believe that the generic advice of diversification and low risk plays are the answer for those who want to make a lot of money while still being young.

The reason is because Google has been basically been built since day 1 for what is possible today.

With much of what is possible today thanks to Google.

Just think of Google compared to OpenAI for example.

Search will go to agents and there is nobody better positioned than Google to win the agent space.

There is no company that has anywhere near the reach that Google enjoys.

Take cars. Google now has the largest car maker in the world, VW, GM, Ford, Honda a bunch of others ones now using Android Automotive as their vehicle OS. Do not confuse this with Android Auto. Google will just put Astra in all these cars. Compare this to OpenAI that has zero access to automobiles.

Same story with TVs. Google has Hisense, TCL, Samsung and a bunch of other TV manufactures using Google TV as their TV OS. Google will have all these TVs get Astra. Compare this to OpenAI that has zero on TVs.

Then there is phones. The most popular OS in the world is Android. Google has over 3 billion active devices running Android and they will offer Astra on all of these phones. Compare this to OpenAI that does not even have a phone operating system.

Then there is Chrome. The most popular browser. Compare this to OpenAI that does not have a browser. Google will be offering Astra built into Chrome.

But that is really only half the story. The other is Google has the most popular applications people use and those will be fully integrated into Astra.

So you are driving and Astra will realize you are close to being out of gas and will tap into Google Maps to give you the gas station ad right at the moment you most need it. Google will also integrate all their other popular apps like Photos, YouTube, Gmail, etc.

Even new things like the new Samsung Glasses are coming with Google Gemini/Astra built in.

There just was never really a chance for OpenAI. Google has basically built the company for all of this and done the investment to win the space.

The big question is what Apple will ultimately do? They are just not built to provide this technology themselves.

I believe that Apple at some point will just do a deal with Google where they share in the revenue generated by Astra/Gemini from iOS devices. Same thing they are doing with the car makers and TV makers.

They will need to because of how many popular applications Google has.

Astra will also be insanely profitable for Google. There is so many more revenue generation opportunities with an Agent than there is with just search.

BTW, it will also be incredibly sticky. Once your agent knows you there is little chance you are going to switch to a different one. This is why first mover is so important with the agent and why Google is making sure they are out in front with this technology.

Plus the agent is going to know you far better than anything there is today so the ads will also be a lot more valuable for Google.

The other thing that Google did that helps assure the win is spending the billions on the TPUs starting over a decade ago. Google is not stuck paying the massive Nvidia tax that OpenAI is stuck paying. Plus Google does not have to wait in the Nvidia line.

That is how Google can offer things like Veo2 for free versus OpenAI Sora

https://www.reddit.com/link/1hg6868/video/sopmwriocd7e1/player?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=OpenAI&utm_content=t3_1hg6868

Or how Google is able to offer Gemini Flash 2.0 for free. But this is a very common MO for Google. They offer this stuff for free and suck out all the money and hurt investment into competitors. Then once the competition is gone Google will bump up the ads and/or subscription price. Plus the fact that people are not going to want to switch Agents it will also allow Google to bump up the ads without losing material customers.; Wedbush should probably consider gardening and touching grass.

I’m a bit worried; Odd take.  MSFT is a AI pure play?   Do not think so.

The #1 on the list, easily, is Alphabet.   They have basically built the company from the ground up for today.

They are the only one with the entire stack.   Google was just brilliant to have built the TPUs over a decade ago.  The head scratcher is how Microsoft could have missed it so badly.  It was not like Google did the TPUs in secret.

Google just has had far better vision than Microsoft.   But what sets Google apart is not just being the leader in AI.   But that with their unmatched reach.

Google has far more reach than any other company on the planet.  They are in cars with Android Automotive.  They have the largest car maker in the world, VW.  Then Ford, GM, Honda and a bunch of other ones.

They have TVs.  Google TV now comes installed in TCL, HiSense, Sony and a bunch of other ones.  Literally millions and millions of TVs ship with Google inside.

Android is the most popular mobile OS by far.   With over 3 billion active devices.  Then Google has Chrome the most popular browser by far.

But it is not just the devices.  But then Google has the most popular applications which will all be integrated into Astra.

Google is going to put their agent, Astra, on everything.  TVs, Cars, Phones, Browsers, etc.   They will integrate it with YouTube, Maps, Photos, Gmail, etc.

So you will be driving down the road and Astra will know you are close to being out of gas and you will right at the perfect moment get an ad for a gas station by taping into Google Maps.

Plus the agent will be incredibly sticky.  Once it gets to know you there is zero chance you will switch to another.   Plus it will be insanely profitable.  There is so many more revenue opportunities with an Agent versus just search.

11,Switching to Long Term Investing,"Hello Everyone - (33m) looking for some financial input. I recently bought a house and am looking to now dive deeper into the stock market and long term investing. Over the past few years I’ve kept a lot of money in a money market account and the interest has done quite well, though I know the stock market would have yielded better results. I’ve always had low risk tolerance and I believe it’s because I’ve worked hard to get to where I am and would have to see me lose that. Here’s where I’m at today:

Outside of retirement investment accounts I will be moving $200,000 into the stock market. My initial thought was to go into a mix of the following:

75% - Vanguard Funds (VOO, VTI, VFIAX, VIG)
20% - Apple, Google, Amazon
5% - TSM and other stocks that may not have the most “safety” to them but has a good upside for the future

Is there any advice you could give me in the position I am in?

Thank you ",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hqe7m4/switching_to_long_term_investing/,3,2024-12-31 14:00:04,"Reading some of your conversations here, it seems to me that you might really enjoy reading about the Boglehead investing philosophy (named after the Vanguard founder, John Bogle).   There is a Boglehead subreddit that is worth checking out.

Investing in this style is pretty simple and it has a great track record.   It is very well suited for people who have lower/moderate risk tolerance and who want to invest with a long term buy and hold strategy (ie, it's not a get rich quick strategy).   

Basically such a portfolio would consist of a US stock component, an optional international stock component, and a bond component (this is the part that mitigates volatility/risk at the expense of the highest possible returns).    

First you would consider your stock allocation (US/foreign).   A good reasonable starting point is 80/20.   US market funds to consider (pick 1!):  VOO, VTI, FXAIX, FSKAX.    

Foreign stock market funds (funds containing the world's stocks, minus the US): VXUS, or FTIHX.   

Then consider what kind of bond fund you might want (or you could just buy individual bonds).   Typical bond funds people would recommend are BND, or FXNAX.   

So you would have your 80/20 stock portion, and then you would want to consider your stock/bond allocation.   At your age, and given a long time horizon, it's perfectly reasonable to also do 80/20 stocks/bonds.   You would increase your bond allocation over time as you get closer to retirement (you might end up at the commonly recommended 60/40 stock/bond setup... or if you are truly risk averse, you may go even higher on the bonds).

The beauty of this portfolio is that it can consist of 2 or 3 funds.   That is elegance and simplicity.   

A sample portfolio for your age might be:  Stocks: 80% of portfolio, bonds 20% of portfolio.

Stock portion: 80% VOO, 20% VXUS.   (80% US stock, 20% international)

Bond portion: BND.

That is 3 funds.   Easy Pleasy!   As you get nearer to retirement, gradually kick up the bond portion to closer to 40% of your total portfolio.    



Things you want to research to do something like this (make sure you can make a reasonable argument for whatever answer you settle on):

S&P500 or US total market fund? (this one is actually pretty easy: it doesn't matter, but read about it anyway).   

Do I need international stocks or should I go US only?   (This one sparks serious debate; make sure you understand the arguments).

Do I need bonds, and if so, how much, % wise?; >Is there any advice you could give me in the position I am in?

You're going to see red days.  And you're going to have to become comfortable with it.  No one always sees green days.  It's one thing to say you are ok with red days, and it's quite another to live them, especially when you are aware you have a low risk tolerance.  If you truly are in it for the long term (10+ years), then you need to become comfortable going to a stock chart for VOO or VTI or VT or whatever, and zooming it out to its max duration and looking at that trend up.  That is your backbone.  That is your rationale for the red days, and you stick with your plan.; > 75% - Vanguard Funds (VOO, VTI, VFIAX, VIG)

Why both VOO and VFIAX? They're effectively the same thing.

> 20% - Apple, Google, Amazon

Why? Especially if they'll be part of a fund.

> 5% - TSM and other stocks that may not have the most “safety” to them but has a good upside for the future

Is it that you think TSM specifically has a good upside for the future? Or semiconductors in general? If the latter, why not invest in a semiconductor-focused fund?; The phrase in your post that catches my attention is ""I've always had a low risk tolerance..."". Dalbar has found that in general investors tend to underperform their chosen mutual funds, mostly due to bailing out when times get tough. Is this you? I have no way of knowing. Unless you've actually held stocks through a raging bear market you have no way of knowing either. If you're not 100% certain that you can sit through a protracted period of 50% losses (or worse) and feel somewhat ambivalent about it then you should consider a healthy allocation to bonds and cash.; Stock market will be higher volatility due higher expected return. Me personally, I had to read and understand Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises by ray dalio and read stress test to be comfortable to be ready for corrections and bear markets.; All the single stocks you pointed out, you already have in VOO.  Id move that 20% you want to invest to total international market. Such as FIVA or VXUS; Beware of false diversification. VOO, VTI, VFIAX, maybe VIG, Apple, Google, Amazon - all have a ton of overlap. Even without buying Apple, Google, Amazon you'll still be at like 4%-7% of your portfolio being each of those.

It's also not correct to assume your picks will have a better upside. They might, but expectations of future growth are already priced into these stocks - they'd have to surprise the market to have a better-than-market growth. Picking individual stocks ~5% of portfolio is fun and cool, just know that it's further concentrating your portfolio with those picks.

Consider going 15%-30% international equities - both developed and emerging markets. You can grab an ETF for each and maybe pick a few for some specific countries if you want. This is so you have some assets in your portfolio that are not 100% correlated to the US market which means if one of them dips and the other didn't, you can sell some of the better-performing asset to buy more of the dipped asset which should then experience better-than-average returns during the recovery. There are options other than international / equities for this type of diversification / portfolio balancing.

But I think you got a general handle on it, you'll be good if you go with your plan I just think there's room for a little risk optimization per the above.; Just go with a 500 fund or a growth fund. It includes heavily the big 7.

Advice...never sell or panic. If you look at the 500 historically we have a loss year every 2-5 years. It has always come back, and just DCA into the funds to buy the dip.; A lot of overlapping stocks ....; Call Fidelity. Have them invest it for you. You will mess up. Your emotions need to be managed. Contribute weekly to their managed account. Good luck!; I really appreciate you taking the time to share this knowledge as it provides me good insight into a simple understanding of long term investment strategy. Thank you again. This seems like the option best suited for me. I will research the portions you recommended.; Thank you! I definitely know that I must be ok with the downfalls and for me the way I feel more comfortable with that is by going heavily into the vanguard funds knowing that it essentially mirrors the S&P 500 and long term that should be a safe route.; Hey thanks for the feedback! I was trying to understand the correlation between VFIAX and VOO a bit better. Seems VFIAX has some sort of small fee associated with it as well as a minimum investment amount? 

My reasoning for also choosing apple, Google and Amazon outside of the mutual funds was because I feel they’re very strong companies that have some higher upside individually than the full fund.

In terms of TSM it was a company that I see come up a lot when listening to some financial podcasts. I’m not necessarily well versed in the semi conductor world.; Some exposure I’ve had here is the middle of the last presidency. I had gone into more individual stock companies that took a pretty big hit. I held until my portfolio came back to its original number and then pulled everything out to rebalance. Mind you this was only a small sample size of $25,000 but they were companies like Uber, Alibaba, Delta, Carnival Cruise Line, AT&T.; Thank you!; All makes a ton of sense, thanks for clarifying the piece of glass diversification and the idea around diversifying into international markets.; What do their fees look like? My concern is they don’t have a real connection to my money like I do. I know they’re obviously a strong financial institution but still at the end of the day if they lose my money they’ll still sleep at night.; Happy to help!   Lots of far more knowledgeable folks than I on the Bogleheads forum.   Best of luck to ya!; > I was trying to understand the correlation between VFIAX and VOO a bit better. Seems VFIAX has some sort of small fee associated with it as well as a minimum investment amount?

One is mutual fund, one is an ETF. You'll have to do your own reading on the differences there.

Funds have ""expense ratios"" which is the relative cost, to the shareholder, of managing the fund. Index-based funds tend to be low. VOO is 0.03%, VFIAX is 0.04%. By comparison, there are funds out there with expense ratios well above 1.00%. 

So in this case, I'd consider the difference to be negligable. 

> In terms of TSM it was a company that I see come up a lot when listening to some financial podcasts. I’m not necessarily well versed in the semi conductor world.

There's a saying out there, ""invest in what you know."" Whether that's the industry you work in, or if it's a product or company you're familiar with in everyday life, etc. And if nothing else, to do the homework on a company's financials before investing in it.

To put your money into some individual company, in a sector you're not all that familiar with, without having done the fundamental financial research, because it comes up on podcasts... 😬 that just is too much of a gamble to me. But you do you.; If you want to be overweight in Tech, then you may want to just buy QQQM instead of individual stocks.

Maybe think about an allocation like:

75% VOO
20% QQQM
5% TSM; Yeah that's one of the primary purposes of portfolio balance.

If you set a target of 50% Asset1 and 50% Asset2, if Asset1 dips (or Asset2 grows) more than the other, Asset1 will now be less than 50% of your portfolio - so when you rebalance you will either put all of your new money into Asset1 or maybe even sell-to-buy Asset2 (considering tax costs) to get it back to 50/50.

That gives you the effect I described earlier, but operating off a target % removes emotions and whims from the equation (and it can be automated if preferred).; Fidelity and vanguard are the lowest fees in the game. Them not having a connection to the money is the key brother. Connection to the money is your weakness. That is what concerns me about your comments. For people just getting started, I normally just tell them VOO on a weekly basis, set it and forget it. But when the money is large, that is when pro management is worth it. I think of it like a car: if you had a 200k car, would you pop the hood and start tinkering with the engine? Still do stuff on your own, for sure. Fidelity is great platform for that. But for that amount of money I’m scared for you. You will get buyers remorse and make common rookie mistakes. A pro will remind you to remove emotion. Zoom out. Stick to the plan. The problem with Fidelity and vanguard is that the advisors aren’t paid well, so they just happy with what you give them, they don’t push you to do more (which I personally believe is an advisor’s TRUE job). Good luck my man!; I appreciate the honest feedback! It’s why I posted here because I know that I’m not as well versed in investing as I’d like to be. Thanks again.; Thank you!; Thank you sir! I appreciate all your feedback and know removing my emotions will be the key here."
12,Vanguard Funds: VTSAX and VHYAX,"VTSAX is admiral shares of VTI. Total Market.

But I also hold VHYAX. A fund that is supposed to provide dividend efficiency.

For the new year I am thinking of consolidating everything into VISAX.

Not sure what my reasoning was when I bought VHYAX. The top holdings are pretty similar. Apple being the top pick.

Anybody have a take on the Dividend fund? Am I duplicating my efforts?

Dividends are kind of pointless for the little amount of capital you have allocated.  You'd be better off consolidating some of those into SPYD (S&P etf that pays a higher dividend) if you are really committed to dividends. (Apple, Google are in the SPY ETF--all the Mag7's are in SPY and QQQ)

14,Analysis of XPEL,"**The Business:**

XPEL sells, distributes, and installs protective paint film (PPF) along with other protective coatings and care products aftermarket in the automotive, marine, and architectural window markets.  Founded in 1997, listed on the NASDAQ since 2019, XPEL began as a software company designing vehicle patterns used to produce cut-to-fit protective film for the painted surfaces of automobiles. In 2007, they expanded in selling automotive surface and paint protection film products to complement their proprietary software.  They currently boast the best self-repairing PPF on the market with their ULTIMATE product line and operates in 12 countries globally.  

In their 2023 Annual Report, revenues were generated in the following segments:

* Surface and Paint Protection film sales represented approximately 58.0% of consolidated revenue
* Installation, Dealership and OEM Services were roughly 18%
* Automotive Window film made up 14.8%
* Architectural window film sales represented approximately 2.3%
*  SaaS subscription accounted for >2%.
* The remaining revenues came from ceramic coatings, aftercare products, and other misc. items.

Automotive products make up the vast bulk of their revenue with PPF wraps being the major revenue generator.  To that end, XPEL has a certified installer program that is coupled with their Design Access Platform (“DAP”), which is a SAAS platform and database consisting of over 80,000 vehicle applications.  The benefits of using software for installation include increased installation efficiency and reduction of waste.  They primarily operate by selling directly to independent installers and new car dealerships, which includes XPEL protection films, installation training, access to the DAP software, marketing support and lead generation. Approximately 63.2% of consolidated revenue was through this channel in 2023.  Sales are global, with North American representing 67.7% of total sales and China representing 10.5%.

**The Industry:**

I'm focusing on the the global automotive wrap films market because of the bulk of XPEL's revenue coming from this segment.   The size of this market was valued at USD 6.21 Billion in 2022,  Estimates range from 11% up to 22% out to 2032, which includes both the selling of and installation of PPFs.  Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) is the most popular material, which accounted for 82.74% of the market in 2023.  Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is another common material used in PPF.  TPU boasts self-healing properties, which helps explain its dominance in the market.

**XPEL by the Numbers:**

* 23.6% CAGR on Revenue from 2021 to 2023.
   * 2021 revenue growth was 63% over 2020, which skews the numbers a bit, but since 2019 revenue growth has been 18% or greater.
* EPS grew from $0.51 to $1.91 from 2019 to 2023, with the lowest YoY growth being 27%.
* Gross Margin percent has climbed into the low 40% range and has been increasing each year since 2019.
* Unlevered Free Cash Flow has climbed from $4.98m to $18.37m, 2019 to 2023.
* Long term debt, as of Q3 2024, sits under $1m.  They have a Current Ratio of 4.35.
* Fiscal Year 2023 ended with ROE of 34.66%, ROA at 18.80%, and ROIC of 21.87%.
   * Company boasts double digits in all three ratios since 2019.
* SG&A has grown significantly, up 4x from 2019 to Q3 2024 TTM.
   * Growth in marketing strategy is management's explanation for the increase.
   * They expect Q4 to be flat QoQ. 

**Competitive Advantages:** 

* Brand Name - Xpel has a very strong brand name in the North American PPF market.  They protect their brand name through their certified installer program.  Their ULTIMATE line is recognized as one of the top 2 products lines on the market; STEK being recognized as the other.  XPEL's 10 year warranty shows they stand behind their product and adds another strength to the brand. 
* Switching Moat (weak) - their DAP software is comprehensive.  It ties in with the certified installer program.  Installers complete the program, use the software, and buy the product.  While not like switching from an Apple, Microsoft, or Enterprise software environment, it still represents some protection.
* Patents, Trademarks, and Copyrights - while manufacturing is done third party, XPEL holds patents on their products.  With the best self repairing wrap on the market, they have some pricing power on a premium product.  

**The Risks**

* XPEL competes with big names, such as 3M, Eastman Chemical Company, Saint-Gobain, STEK, SunTek, LLumar, and others.  XPEL is not a direct manufacturer of their products and rely on 3rd Part Manufacturers.  They could lose their competitive advantage if someone brings a better product to market.  
* Their business in China is localized through one distributor.  Alteration to or loss of that relationship would seriously impact their revenue and bottom line.  
* If the incoming Administration starts a trade war with China, it could seriously impair XPEL's business.  Both from a sales standpoint and raw material costs.  
* Failure to stand by their products or an excess of warranty claims could damage their brand, top line revenue, or costs that would impact the bottom line.
* A decline in the automotive industry as a whole would materially impact XPEL in their aftermarket industry.

**The Thesis:**

XPEL is a leader in their market and will continue to be.  They are well positioned to take advantage of industry growth with their low asset model, nearly no long-term debt, and brand awareness to grow market share through acquisition and organic growth. 

**Valuation:**

This company is still young and in a growth phase, so I feel a DCF Model is not the best way to go.\^1  Instead I'm using a Discounted Future Earnings model.  Earnings growth over the last 5 years has grown at a CAGR of 30%.  I'm using 20% over the next 5 years to be more conservative.  I used a discounted rate of 12.7% which is a WACC value pulled online.  Ending PE Ratio of 25.  Fair market value would be **$59.00/share**.  Using a 30% MoS because I'm still researching gives us a Buy Price of **$41.30**.

Based on my current analysis, I have opened a small, starter position in the company.


&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
^(1 - a simple DCF using TTM Free Cash Flow with a 20% growth rate that is halved at 5 years then halved again for a terminal rate at 10 years, with a 30% MoS, yields a buy price of $16.41.)  
^(§ - reposting my thoughts from another sub)",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hq5im5/analysis_of_xpel/,16,2024-12-31 04:22:18,"$XPEL is highly cyclical and there’s ALOT of competitors in the space.

They have been able to grow because they basically buy out distributors/outlets and place thier products within that channel.

I haven’t kept up with how their car dealer business is doing..

I made some money with them in the boom boom years but imo, due to the high competition, low player entrance cost, and current saturation of their products to-date… there’s better plays out there 🤷 imo; I appreciate your feedback.  I do believe they've built some competitive advantages into their model through their complete turn-key solution by offering certified training, their proprietary DAP software, and complementary product lines.  
  
They still distribute to independent dealerships.  They also have cooperative arrangements with Rivian and Tesla, though the Tesla business should/will decline due to Tesla introducing some PPF options at a couple of their facilities.  
  
Their global expansion and growth leads me to believe the market isn't saturated.  There's runway there still.  It's going to be tied closely to the new car market, so a sharp decline there will cause short-term pain.  However, as long as new cars are being sold, high-end cars especially, they'll have a market for their product.  
  
I'll grant you, this isn't a grand slam, 100 bagger.  But, I'll take base hits in the current market.  😆"
15,"Robinhood rugpulled me, what do I do?","
On december 20th I deposited around $5k into RH in order to buy some crypto. I bought said crypto and tried to withdraw a small amount, and then the rest of the crypto into a hardware wallet. The small transaction (<$1) went through, but when I tried doing the larger one it said that my account is restricted from withdrawing crypto. This was like my second time ever buying crypto on robinhood, I only did it on RH because my main exchange wasn’t working. 

The next day, I tried withdrawing again, to no avail. I tried liquidating the position and withdrawing cash, also no luck. At this point I had no response from live chat at all (up to now have still not received ANY non bot response). I get a request through the app to upload documents (id, bank statement, and selfie), which I do promptly. FYI I have passed kyc on robinhood already. 

Now, every single nth day of december I log on, I check the status of my verification and see the message “We’ll review your documents and notify you about your account restrictions by December n+1”. Basically, every time I log on, I am assured that I will get some update the next day. But when the next day comes, I’m assured an update the day after that. 

What do I do in this case? I have tried communicating with RH through any way I could find but have not received any response. No responses from live chat, email, or phone. Already filed SEC complaint. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hppyje/robinhood_rugpulled_me_what_do_i_do/,0,2024-12-30 16:44:04,"This is some red flag behavior. You deposited money, then immediately converted it to crypto and then tried to transfer that to another account? This 100% looks like a scam where you're trying to get the money out via crypto before the deposit fully clears and is possibly rejected or someone else claims the money was fraudulently taken from their account.; You're trying to trade with uncollected funds.  Then you're trying to pull crypto on uncollected funds.  It's only been 4 bank settlement days since you made the deposit.

Of course you got restricted.; This post is so confusing.


Did your deposited funds clear (become available funds to trade) when you bought the crypto?

What is the status of the deposited funds now?

What is your current position?

 That is do you own crypto now? Or have you sold it and made a profit or loss? 

Do you have cash in your account ready to make trades? 

Do you have deposited cash that doesn't show?

The normal process is

You deposit money-money clears-you buy crypto-you either withdraw the crypto to a wallet or you sell it - cash available in account changes reflects precious steps

Where has robinhood exactly failed?; I think you need to contact them. I guess this sucks but in the future use a legit broker.; If you aren't money laundering then this looks like money laundering activity.

You did a deposit.  
bought crypto.  
sold crypto.  
Tried to withdraw/transfer the money before the original deposit even fully cleared. To a DIFFERENT account then where the deposit came from!?

Of course you got restricted and triggered every anti money laundering system on the way.

If you aren't trying to scam, give time for the transactions to fully settle and clear.; Lesson learned don’t buy crypto; Wait 7 business days after deposit.. initially they provide instant amount for trade.. they will allow withdrawals once your deposited funds reached them; Don’t use Robinhood.; Bro speedran every AML red flag in the book lol; It surprises me that people still trust Robinhood with their money after what they pulled and got away with during the whole GameStop thing. I would never put my money on that platform; 

>On december 20th I deposited around $5k into RH in order to buy some crypto. 

no issues so far

> and tried to withdraw a small amount

Why?

> and then the rest of the crypto into a hardware wallet. 

Why?

> The small transaction (<$1) went through, but when I tried doing the larger one it said that my account is restricted from withdrawing crypto. 

Probably because they saw you try to withdraw money you had *just* invested in crypto, which screams money laundering. Are you aware the PATRIOT Act requires brokerages to monitor for money laundering and other similar suspicious behavior?

> The next day, I tried withdrawing again, to no avail. I tried liquidating the position and withdrawing cash, also no luck. 

Of course not, they flagged your account for suspicious behavior 

> What do I do in this case? 

1. Wait. Your account has been flagged for fraud/money laundering. It’s going to take some time for their investigation to be completed. Normal CSRs probably can’t even see into your account since the fraud department should have shut access to your account down (if RH knows what they’re doing as a brokerage)
2. In the future, avoid behaviors that look like money laundering to their fraud department.
3. Probably avoid Robinhood; Agreed, you fucked yourself OP.  Any self-respecting (aka not “rug pulling”) institution would protect their (and by extension, your) assets here.  

You, in the hypothetical situation of being a person who possibly didn’t know about the bank deposit and subsequent crypto withdrawal to a random address making it effectively “cash”.  albeit a terrible form of cash that is very volatile and can be sketchily traded for actual cash.

They’re trying to protect everyone involved, you, your bank account.  Just not your gambling interests.; My account is basically in limbo. I’m restricted from buying anything with what’s sitting in my account. It’s just cash. They are not letting me withdraw anything and not telling me why.; This is a good point. Been hearing a lot about the difference in business models between traditional brokerages and RH. It's crazy how much these new brokerage apps mimic gaming/casinos.; > I think you need to contact them. I guess this sucks but in the future use a legit broker.  

It's very common now for all crypto exchanges to have hold times for any deposits, often up to a full week. You can thank all the dummies who did chargebacks or told their banks that someone else deposited the cash to the exchange so that they could withdraw free crypto.; Contacting them has proven to be impossible; Just be forewarned that the outcome might be the same. The first time I made a large deposit to Fidelity they held it for 15 business days. I could invest it but not withdraw it. If they told me I didn’t notice, I just happened to find it mentioned on an out-of-the-way tab: “$10,000 of this balance isn’t available until January.”; What do you mean by legit brokers? Do you have any examples (especially ones that are also available in Europe?); There are much better ways to purchase than fuckin robinhood. Crypto is fine just don’t be dumb; Yeah that's the lesson here. 


Don't let your hate blind you. ; You mean don't money launder; Almost every brokerage didn’t allow you to buy GME during that time. Which ones did?; [deleted]; I understand that firms have risk management and compliance rules that they have to follow, which warrants them putting holds on accounts. That’s fine and I get that. They are rugpulling me because they are making the hold indefinite and not taking any steps to look into it. They are ignoring all of my communication requests.; You probably triggered AML controls. You simply have to try to contact your broker. 

Also - complaining to the SEC is probably not going to help since you said it was crypto. Crypto transactions are not regulated by the SEC.; Yeah. I guess I'm not clear. No one will let you withdrawal cash or equivalent until the deposit has cleared.; I don't know anything about Europe. For usa use fidelity, Schwab or vanguard are big ones; I disagree, crypto is not investing. It’s pure speculation; Nope - that's not really true. I traded GME just fine at several brokers. The reason why RH shut down buying of meme stocks was because RH didn't have the same maturity and sophistication to handle the net cap risks as other brokers.

RH generally caters to less sophisticated and inexperienced investors and wanna-be traders so I think a lot of people simply misunderstand what happened at RH during the GME event.; Correct. Etrade screwed me on some gains because they shut down buying and selling during various stages when it was going down.; I didn’t say it was money laundering, I said it can appear to their fraud department as though it’s money laundering. This clearly tripped AML flags at RH; Robinhood the $34 billion dollar corporation isn't engaging in a half dozen felonies to steal your $5,000.

It will get sorted out eventually.; They are legally not allowed to talk to you about a suspicious activity investigation until it’s complete.  This is standard procedure at any financial institution.; The thing is, there is no way for me to get into contact with them. They ignore all avenues of communication I try. Phone call, email, live chat all don’t work.; I never said it was investing. Just better ways to buy. I know lots of people making crazy money with crypto. They are all very smart though. You can play the trends; Please name the brokers. TD Ameritrade didn’t work 

Please name the brokers; [deleted]; That's kinda why most people don't recommend using RH. Their support is generally considered sub-par and inferior to other brokers. Try sending a written letter. And continue to call them.

What you described does sound like an AML restriction. It probably just takes a while to get through whatever AML reviews are required.; I traded on Merrill Edge, Fidelity, Schwab, and TDA. This was in both IRA's and margin accounts. I carry PM at Fidelity and TDA. And I was trading option short strangles at the time.  Obvious in the IRA's I traded different strategies other than strangles and naked calls.

Not sure why it wouldn't have worked for your at TDA. Maybe you didn't have the BP,

All the brokers that I used raised margin requirements to 100% but I had sufficient BP and cash to trade.; OP literally tried to do all 3 steps of the money laundering process within 2 days right around a global holiday. Just because it's a small amount doesn't mean it won't trip the AML algorithms. 


Now he just has to give it time for a shitty broker to sort it all out.; Basically every US-centric exchange requires photo ID for selling crypto but not buying. OP's photo ID is stuck in limbo because of RH dragging its feet. It's not a rugpull, just a combination of cheat customer service (probably not helped by the holiday season) and standard regulations.; Thanks. For me TDA was down for several hours; I only use ToS and I login usually before market open. Could have been capacity related. I know that Schwab recently had some capacity authentication issues after the final TDA account migration earlier this year."

GDP would be comparable to revenue or something recurring; It simply won't (can't) grow as much as it did in the last decade, but GDP isn't a limitation to a company's valuation; It can grow infinitely, but that doesn’t mean it will.

The GDP comparison never makes sense and the growth of Apple has already been slowing down. It won’t keep the same growth rates of the past.

That being said as long as Apple sells more devices as they did before or find new services or products to sell they will grow.; It will always grow due to inflation.

Can Apple outperform? Yes there are markets they can grow sales in but it’s going to be harder and slower. 

Do I personally think Apple is going to continue to outperform? No. I think its valuation has disconnected from its actual earnings and projections. I believe their stock buyback is so large and their decision to stop reporting unit sales for many products paint a picture of the company seeing slowing growth. 

Do I think Apple is safe stock to buy? Yes. It’s a cash cow that’s created a borderline self sustaining customer base for its products. On top of that they buy back a disgusting amount of stock and will continually get more inflows from passive funds.; To learn about how companies are valued in the market (or theoretically should be), you can read ""The Intelligent Investor"" by Benjamin Graham.  It goes through the details about how to read balance sheets and understand the financial drivers of the stock price.  That said, the valuation of the M7 stocks is historically relatively high in terms of P/E and the book was written long before any of these tech companies existed.  However, it is a good starting point.; AAPL can continue to go up just due to inflation and stock buybacks, although I would be concerned about current valuation; They can grow forever. Inflation rises 2-3% per year which will continually boost revenue, earnings, and share price. They’ll continue to use their FCF to buy back shares which will boost EPS and share price. And developing countries will continue to expand and buy their products. India alone has 700M people buying cell phones, but only 12M of them are iPhones. There’s no reason Apple couldn’t sell 100M+ to them. Same in China. Same in Brazil. Same in a lot of countries.; Third worlder here. iPhones used to be largely unaffordable for the masses. Now with 24 to 48 month installment plans coupled with bnpl and trade-in schemes, even minimum wage earners and broke college kids in the third world can and do splurge on the latest Pro Max, Watches, MacBook every two to three years. 

And before you know it, there'll be a new Apple product for the masses. Never bet against Apple.; 

 > In the past decade Apple's share price has gone up 900%, and it now sits at a valuation of $3.8 trillion, already worth more than the GDP of all countries.

You, and many others, must get acquainted with the difference between a stock quantity (the market valuation of a company"") and a flow quantity (the GDP of a country). The GDP of a country, which is a flow quantity, is the annual output of a system (the economy). The market valuation of a company, which  is a stock quantity (stock not intended as share), is a value at one point in time, it's not a periodic outcome, and it only varies due to variation in two other variables, price and number of shares. You're not comparing apples with apples.; [https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/price-sales](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/price-sales)

While it was growing sales 4 to 10 years ago, the P/S was in the 2 to 4 range. Now that it is no longer growing sales, the multiple has expanded to 10. Flat sales for 3 or 4 years now. They have reached a point where they can't ask people to pay more for iPhones, and you can only nickel and dime customers with service fees so much. IOW, it is expensive now.; Investors will eventually see what you saw. That the entire globe will need to dump everything they've ever made over a lifetime, in order to get the stock to go up just by 1%. 



Eventually people are going to get over the brand name of owning the stock. 


It's more important to me personally to have a high ROI percent. I'm not willing to sit here and hold Apple for a measly 3% gain a week. When I can dump it into quantums and get 40% gains a week


Eventually there will be a critical mass of investors who are tired of watching their Apple holdings collect dust, never growing more than a single percent because of how large the company is. 



I cannot tell you when that's going to happen, But I personally have written off Apple. Because I can make 10 times higher ROI on smaller companies that have a lot of room to grow. 



The time to buy Apple was 10 years ago. It is a boomer stock.; They are already growing by doing horizontal integration of their supply chain. They are producing their own chips now.
Also they can acquire companies to integrate into their eco system. 
Imagine a world where everything is made by apple. That’s the growth potential.; That market cap is so prodigious. I have shipped my apple, I just don't like it as much as Amazon. Amazon just feels so much more innovative and seems like it has room. Same for goog...; There is no top to dollar-denominated assets because there is no top to the amount of money printing by government; You are just looking at one number. You are not looking at the reason, the justification for that number.; It's not even the stock price valuation but with Apple the entire company valuation.; Three things have contributed to AAPL’s share price rising over the last decade:

* Earnings doubled
* PE quadrupled
* AAPL deployed hundreds of billions to buyback shares at relatively cheap prices

Of those three, I only think the first could happen again over the next decade. I dont think it’s reasonable to assume that the PE will 4x to 160. If anything, it’s safe to assume it will fall over the next 10 years.

And while they may deploy hundreds of billions in buy backs over the next 10 years, there will be two key differences. One, the prices probably wont be as deflated as they were. And two, hundreds of billions is less significant at its current valuation than when it was a sub-trillion dollar company (for example). Those two things mean that future buybacks should have less of an effect than previous attempts.

Tl;dr Yes it can grow, but dont expect a repeat.; *most countries. US, China, Japan and Germany have a GDP in excess of AAPL's cap. Though that's an irrelevant comparison.; I can tell Apple you will eventually pull out of the Asian largest market. Overpriced product for countries that make similar but sell for less.  It is cheaper to buy new Apple products in China than USA. If Apple has another local contender at home it will then reduce price of its products.; I don’t think there’s is a limit on how high numbers go; They will continue to grow but not as fast as we have seen in the past. Compared to Google and Tesla I feel like they are behind in AI. I feel like Robotics and AI assistants are going to be huge in the next 10 years. But this could change at any point because again apple likes to try an innovate and I could see them doing more to get involved. This is only based on my knowledge so correct me if I'm wrong.; Growing profits for a company like Apple is easier than growing revenue. They are insourcing chips and reducing third-party suppliers, which lowers their costs and improves their profits. So yes if they become more profitable their valuation will also increase; Apple's services division is crushing it with [record growth in streaming and cloud services](https://beyondspx.com/article/apple-inc-nasdaq-aapl-embracing-the-future-with-cutting-edge-innovation), plus they're expanding into new markets like spatial computing with Vision Pro and [investing heavily in AI](https://beyondspx.com/article/apple-inc-nasdaq-aapl-embracing-the-future-with-cutting-edge-innovation), so while past growth rates aren't sustainable, they've got plenty of room to grow through new revenue streams and market expansion rather than just relying on iPhone sales.; It’ll keep growing until everyone in the world owns it; I'll be the contrarian. This has seen it's high for the next couple years.; I sorta theorise that unless they up their game with better/cheaper products they will begin to lose market share. I just recently bought a cheap $350AUD Motorola, probably could have got it for 300 during all these recent sales. Point is though the Motorola is extremely fast and has almost all the new features most phones do with facial unlock to input passwords etc.. 8gb ram, snapdragon chip, 128gb storage forget the camera specs but it's quite good. Yeah brand name apple still has people by the throat for some reason but with everything becoming expensive is it really worth it to spend 4-5x that for a new iPhone with a couple extra features lol. iPhones at first were quite innovative no doubt, they sort of just held onto that original claim to fame and kept people with their brand but they are not really innovating anymore. Eventually if you do not innovate you will be left behind but apples so big I do not see it failing anytime in the remotely near future.; Why do people on Reddit not understand the difference between GDP and valuation or net worth?; Not a direct answer but if you’re worried about lower % ROI cuz apple too big then options is the solution. Options prices are cheaper when the stock is expected to move less so you can still get 50% yoy returns if apple only goes up a little bit per year; About three fiddy; That depends.  As long as they continue to have the money for MASSIVE buybacks, AAPL share price will continue to increase.  Outstanding shares peaked at 25B 10-12 years ago.  Today the float is 15B.  Not complicated.  Add to this all the money automatically flowing into index funds.  For every dollar, 7 cents goes to buying more AAPL.  There is a tremendous amount of tailwind for AAPL share price.; AAPL is overvalued right now if that’s what your asking; It can grow forever; Well not all companies can keep 10xing. 

What would realistically happen, is if they quit coming out with new ways to make more and more money, they would now start paying down debts, trying to cut costs over time, and keep supplying a good product. And turn into a dividend stock.; Um not when people are crazy enough to buy their products every year to have the newest edition iPhone or tablet.  How do you expect it to just level out?  People will just magically become satisfied and not want to compete?  As long as there is a demand, Apple will fulfill it.; I don't know and at this point I don't care, their product launches have failed miserably and the last 150% gains in the stock have been purely empty hype for ai and multiple expansion, who is to say the same idiots don't slap a 50 or 60 pe on it next, I'm just staying away from apple; If they come out with like an apple toilet or apple shoe. Infinity and beyond.; Never?; Apple marketcap is 3.812 billion USD vs 123 billion USD profit in the last 12 months.

Tesla's marketcap is 1.356 billion USD vs 8.73 billion USD profit in the last 12 months.

You could find similar numbers for NVDA, MSFT or Google.
All of them are valued 1 or 2 or 3 billion USD and make between 1% and 3% profit of their marketcap every year.
These companies could still grow in marketcap if they solidy a monopoly, kill competitors and stay innovative.

If people are still using iPhone 26 and AirPods 9 in a decade or 2 or whatever replaces the iPhone, they could grow.

If not, well idk; Hard to match the explosive growth over the last 15 years because they rolled out smartphones and app store...which took the world by storm. If the rest of the developing world can gain access to their products or services we can still see very high growth. ""The next billion users"" still don't have resources for flagship phones...but older ones that Americans don't want anymore can still turn profit in marginalized countries. Plus 30% app store revenue will continue to grow as the user base does.

The brand overall has failed to ""wow"" users since Jobs died. Tablets/watches/goggles...all meh. Their ai and the concept/execution of a personal ai assistant/companion may be a bigger driver than their hardware itself in the next decade.; You have to understand that Apple and most of the other big stocks that are overvalued are trading on sentiment. 

They are not trading on value, fundamentals, future earnings. So don't look at them that way. That's not the current trade.

They'll continue like this until investing money runs out, or until the economy tanks or when there is a wake up call like bad earnings where people realize they've paid for a stock with a forward P/E of 42 and that's dumb.

Look, I don't care if you want to blow the ghost of Steve Jobs because you love Apple so much and believe in the company's future blah blah blah - paying a $42 premium for $1 of **expected** future earnings is some dumb shit. 

Until one of the above happens, the price can go to the moon. 

Most of the entire stock market has completely diverged when it comes to price vs. value.

It will have to normalize and if you think it will notmalize by earnings coming up to meet price then you could be right. You'll just have to wait a decade holding a stock you paid too much for.

The more plausible scenario is price drops.

It's the same with commercial real estate, housing, Bitcoin, gold.

Almost all asset classes are overvalued because they sucked up all the money in the economy.; With all the share buybacks Apple does, I believe the share price could grow at a rate that outpaces the market cap growth.; and why would you compare american GDP to an global behemoth like apple?; [deleted]; I hear this argument a lot. But if you want to buy a country I guess you would look at the revenue aka gdp; Yes exactly it can't and won't grow like in the last decade yet it is valued 2.5 times higher than a decade ago, and people still think it is a good investment right here I can't even with some people; That’s not it, as long as ETFs continue to grow they will pour in money into the biggest company in the market l, there’s no fundamental reason to justify the valuation, they barely grow and are up 34% YTD. It’s all about flows now; Or the same number of devices but at a higher price point.

Or the same number and price point but with higher margins  

> growth of Apple has already been slowing down 

Up 34% YTD 🤷 ; And the fact that the world economy grows too, at at least 1% a year ; >And whatever new products they come out with

""with titanium""; This.  Asset prices will continue to grow so long as the current system is in place and more and more currency is issued.  

Money gets paid out to the lowest tier who spend it on goods and services so that it all eventually collects in the hands of the wealthiest 10%.  This class of people have very little need for more money so just keep buying assets to hedge against inflation and try to at least keep pace with it.; Not how it works; ""It will always grow"" This is literally impossible. At some point, Apple will stop growing.; Good one.; Weyland-Yutani has entered the chat.; We saw a pseudo president in office for the last 4 years; I still can't wrap my head around trillion $ valuations. For a long time when I was growing up, Aramco was the only company that had a valuation that high but even then you could kind of scoff at it since they were basically an extension of a large government. Then Apply hit $1 trillion...since then it seems like $1 trillion is the new $100 billion, even though $1 trillion is much, much, much larger than going from, say, $1 billion to $100 billion.; This. There's a thing called the law of large numbers, which is why mega cap stocks can't grow as fast as small and mid cap stocks. Almost none of the stocks that went up 1,000% or more over the last decade were already large cap stocks, I believe the only one that was is UHC.; If you had to estimate, what would you say its rough growth rate % per year for the next decade will be?; Buffett and Munger would disagree with you. Companies have intrinsic values, because the market is auction driven it will mean the market is not always correct.; Some days I wish they had stuck with that.; Yes I agree it is a flawed comparison, as market cap also takes into account future value creation. 


I was mainly using it as symbolic of how vast (and arguably vastly inflated) Apple's valuation is ; Imagine a world where apples are made by Apple.; It's vertical integration and yeah, Apple can optimize a lot of their supply chain to increase net profits will still maintaining the same revenue. 

Another thing to note is that if Apple increases the price of the iphones by just $50, they would make an easy additional  10 billion + profit per year.; Everything made by Apple ? You have to be joking; Honestly outside of inflation being a significant part of a doubling in earnings I think even that isn't that likely over the next decade. Apple's earnings have barely moved for a couple of years now, and what new market can they realistically get into that will be as transformative as the original iPhone was? The Vision Pro was a massive flop despite all the hype. And the government's anti-trust actions against Google could cause the $20+ billion that Apple rakes in via Google paying to be the default search engine each year to disappear, not to mention other anti-trust action could potentially hurt Apple's earnings in other areas to over the next 10 years. The only realistic avenue I see for Apple to keep growing their earnings is via service revenue (a high margin business that has been steadily growing).; That doesn’t make sense lol do you know what those words mean; Actually, they said the “GDP of all countries.”; Lol is your reply really bc ChatGPT said so?; US GDP is like $30Tn. If you consider this as the revenue and stick a c. 1.5x revenue multiple on that (more or less average EV/Revenue of the S&P of 3x with a 50% discount for lower growth of c2-3% vs 5-6% average *revenue* growth rate for S&P companies), the US would be valued at $45Tn.; The U.S. isn’t for sale so it invalidates market cap; > Yes exactly it can't and won't grow like in the last decade

Someone like you would have said the same thing 10 years ago but the truth is you have no idea what AAPL will do over the next decade. I think they’re getting more into the medical software and hardware space which would be a big new revenue stream for them.

You don’t know what’s going to happen with quantum computing either. After all these telecom hacks in the US, iMessages to iMessages were the only texts that weren’t exposed. Apple will continue to focus on creating secure hardware and software and I think they will continue to be successful; ETFs have been around for a fair a bit of time now still Nvidia was able run up the ranks to almost the top. While ETF do contribute a fair bit of money they are not the only ones and they do not do dictate the direction; A company like apple produces a massive amount of cash which they use to aggressively buy back shares. They bought back almost half of their shares in the past decade which means even at 0 net income growth the EPS doubles.; > Up 34% YTD 🤷 

He's talking about its financials, not its stock price...; Yes, but you don't have to buy AAPL to benefit from that growth. Just buy something like (UL) Unilever at a much cheaper valuation. It has plenty of exposure to emerging markets like India, is recession-resistant, and doesn't need to keep coming up with new ""innovations"" like Apple Intelligence and Vision Pro.; And that more and more people in underdeveloped countries will have more expendable income.

Hell, Apple could make a ""cheapo"" phone for those markets right now to offset Android's market share, but they've been fine _so far_ keeping it a ""premium"" product.; I like Titanium. Too bad it’s a poor conductor of heat so Apple can’t use it in more places.; There is a difference between growing in value vs growing in USD. Because of inflation everything even with same value will be higher USD price endless, until inflation stops.; When equity matures it generally shifts towards profit sharing and dividend payouts over reinvestment for growth.


But this has fallen out of favor and Apple would undoubtedly seek new areas to expand into before reaching such a transformational point.; That’s the beauty of inflation and businesses. Eventually most companies will be trillion $ companies.; It’s impossible to say. I strongly believe in Apple, so I think it’s going continue to outperform the sp500. But it’s probably only going to outperform by 1-5% per year the next decade.; It used to trade at a PE ratio of 9-16 times earnings. Now it's at about 40. That's a trick for price growth that can't really repeat unless it gets serious earnings growth.


https://m.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/pe-ratio; Well, not exactly what I’m talking about. Butd finitely related. if you’re interested you should look up R&D expenditures in innovative companies. You’ll see a strong historic correlation, in what Buffett and many others considered pure expenses (R&D) 2 decades ago, with market value.  Especially so in innovative industries. It is still the most interesting and difficult subject when it comes to the valuation of a company. - Which is why anyone who claims they can do it properly - is vastly misinformed or straight up naive; You would pay $10 per apple and couldn’t digest it; You will be made by apple; AAPL is cyclical. Sales are largely flat until a super cycle hits. But yea, inflation will play a significant role in helping AAPL grow its earnings at 7% over the next 10 years; Market cap is share price times number of shares outstanding. If the number of shares drops, then the market cap could drop despite the other number (share price) rising. Which could easily happen if investors decide it deserves a lower P/E. 

100 shares at $10 a share = $1,000 market cap
80 shares at $12 a share = $960 market cap.; Yeah. It’s a joke.. loosen your anus.; Ah yeah. Was drinking when I plugged in the GDP number. Duh.; Dude the US is totally for sale. Already been bought actually. Elon is one of your masters.; Did you look up equity ETFs in 2008 vs now ?look at the explosive growth it’s growing by an average of 25% yearly. Not saying it’s only ETFs but for top companies ETF inflow helps a lot; Yeah because as investors we get paid based on the P&L, not the stock price 🤦‍♂️ ; You don't think millions of people in emerging Indian middle classes are going to buy Apple products?; Decades ago I remember when the talk was the growing global economy will launch emerging markets out of poverty and into the middle class. Since 1995 UL turned a $10,000 investment into $12,232. (Backtested).; At some point in the next century, or perhaps even the next decade, Apple’s market value will likely hit a peak it won’t surpass again. Selling phones and laptops can only take the company so far—it needs bold moves into new markets to sustain its dominance. Its foray into chip-making has been interesting, but it’s unclear how much further that can drive growth. Meanwhile, its efforts in AI and autonomous vehicles haven’t gained meaningful traction, and time may not be on its side.; The current share price implies it’s going to grow a lot faster than that; [deleted]; ... when your mind is uploaded to the Apple afterlife.; Your tears taste salty; Sounds a lot like the Nifty 50. It’ll sort itself out; You kind of do though? 

The stock price is based on the financials. If Apple's income isn't growing fast enough, then it's a lot harder to justify its current stock price at a valuation of over 40x earnings, which is pricing in a lot of growth. Likewise, it's harder to justify its stock price going up further.; They will, eventually. But they’ll also be spending money on fast food (DPZ, YUM) and consumer staples like toothpaste (CL), and these are more affordable than premium smartphones.; UL is up over 450% since 1995. Your numbers are wrong.; There's a big difference between it ""being literally Impossible"" and ""will likely hit a peak"".

Why exactly _can't_ it keep growing, in theory? What makes it impossible, considering it keeps growing relative to the economy and the economy keeps growing too.; Why are people upvoting you? So much ignorance about how stock prices work.; Can you give you’re calculation on that? And growing faster than what?; I am saying I believe it will outperform the SP500 by 1-5% per year.; You should just put your money in an index fund man; Thanks. Don’t know how or where, but I screwed up majorly.  However, 450% is not something I would have been happy about. Maybe the next decades will  be better.; I’m too lazy to create a DCF so got Chat GpT to calculate it for me. Based on current share price, ~8% WACC, and latest free cash flows they would need a terminal growth rate of just over 10% to justify their current price 

As a comparison Walmart’s FCF growth over the past decade has been 1.9%

I don’t think anyone sane expects the S&P to return 10% annually despite the recent run up 

It’s not an exact science but it’s fun to play around with these hypothetical since you don’t even need to boot up excel anymore to get rough estimates; Apples 5 yr EPS growth rate is expected to be roughly 12%.; That’s apples to oranges but once again I don’t think anyone expects the S&P to return 12% for the next 5 years so either way it’s far outpacing the index"
17,What do you think the main event is in terms of AI sector in 2025? Probably the software part prevails...,"Over the weekend, there was a lot of buzz surrounding the DeepSeek-V3 model, with reports claiming that it completed training using only a minimal number of GPUs. In fact, Chinese power concept stocks in the stock market saw a sharp drop last Friday due to this news, but AI-related stocks in the U.S. market remained unaffected.

Just think about it: ByteDance, the Chinese tech giant, is investing 80 billion RMB in computational power in 2024, with an estimated 160 billion RMB next year. It’s unlikely that they will reduce their investment just because of the changes in the training costs of this single model!

Moreover, after conducting some weekend research, it turns out that DeepSeek is a model that took shortcuts—it’s like walking through a maze with a map, skipping the trial-and-error process of exploring each path.

**Here’s a quick breakdown of the research results:**

DeepSeek V3 671B used 2048 H800 units for two months of training, while Llama 3.1 405B used 16,000 H100 units for 80 days. It’s important to note that not all of the 2048 H800 units were used for training power.

1. The computational power consumption of high-quality data generated by the DeepSeek R1 model (which is comparable to OpenAI's o1) is not included.
2. The computational power consumed during the model architecture exploration and debugging stage is not included.

**What does this mean?**

* Point 1: It’s like having a map while navigating a maze directly.
* Point 2: It’s like ignoring the time spent building the program before entering the maze.

This essentially represents a targeted and efficient training approach under objective conditions.

Exploring this method is very meaningful and can inspire many companies on how to better compress hardware requirements under limited computational power. In this regard, it will be very beneficial for future application development. For instance, consider two AI projects: Company A spends 1 million in costs, while Company B only spends 100,000. While the results generated by AI may not be perfect, in certain fields where the demands aren’t too high, it may be sufficient! Lower costs and meeting specific sector standards could open doors for many small and medium-sized AI companies, helping them overcome the barrier to entry and seize opportunities in AI development.

While it’s hard to admit, China has the most experience in this area—be it from Huawei’s mobile phones to ByteDance’s AI (Doubao). This could be a valuable lesson for small and medium-sized companies in the U.S. For example, China’s $AIFU, a small-cap stock combining AI and insurance, is rapidly growing by using AI to develop insurance broker apps. In the U.S., companies like Applovin, a mobile advertising and analytics platform, provide tools to help mobile app developers grow their user base and increase revenue.

**I’m still more inclined to believe that the biggest opportunities for small-cap AI companies will be in AI + software applications in 2025—such as Opendoor Technologies ($OPEN) for AI-powered second-hand homes, $AIFU for AI + insurance, and Carvana ($CVNA) for AI-powered used cars.**

Once hardware innovation stabilizes, development costs will drop rapidly, and the focus will then shift to software. Therefore, in 2025, the main opportunity for AI will definitely be in software!",https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1hpdqsr/what_do_you_think_the_main_event_is_in_terms_of/,13,2024-12-30 04:20:23,"All software products will have “AI” as a feature in 2025, and it’ll be useful but not gamechanging.

A oot if the truly impactful AI software applications will be in the startup space and I expect as large software businesses hone in on their strategy, they’ll buy their innovation and there will be a lot of M&A action over the next several years.  We’re still a bit away from IPO’s of AI led product companies; In 2025, AI will likely focus more on software applications, especially as hardware costs stabilize. The DeepSeek-V3 model's efficient training suggests AI companies can achieve great results with less computational power, lowering entry barriers for small and medium-sized firms. Industries like AI in insurance, real estate, and used cars (e.g., $AIFU, $OPEN, $CVNA) will benefit as software-driven solutions take center stage.; One stock to keep an eye on, or if you have funds to own some, is SNOW"
18,Revenge trading with money you can’t afford to lose on margin works. 132k->72k -> 118k,"Yoloed 24k into MSTR 390c for last Friday right before the JPOW conference. I don’t think you’ll be surprised to hear I lost 95% on those. 
Decided on that Thursday to start revenge trading, so I turned on margin and day traded Tesla with 1DTE options and made 7k. About an hour before close on Thursday threw another 35k into Tesla calls hoping to catch a quick 10% in and out trade. 
But I was in the mountains skiing and just as the market was about to close and I was trying to sell them, my phone screen was covered in snow, making my screen unresponsive. 

The market closed and I was forced to hold them overnight. (Had I been able to sell them I would’ve realized a loss of 7k, which in hindsight would’ve been the play. 

Fast forwards a few hours and in the middle of the night Tesla announces a 700k vehicle recall and Tesla dumps down to 410, making my 442.5 strike calls way out of the money, and options profit calculator telling me they’d be down 95% at open. (This plus the microstrategy loss would put me at around a 60k loss on the week, by biggest loss ever) 

By some miracle PCE inflation data came in at 50% better than expected, pushing stocks up in the premarket. Only putting Tesla to about 430, still way otm. 

When the market opened my portfolio was down to about 85k, I held both the Tesla and the microstrategy calls as they kept dipping. At one point my account hit 72k at the lowest (don’t have a sc of that I was blackout drunk trying to cope, and I was in Europe so it’s not day drinking if it’s after 3pm). 

I decided that fuck it, if it’s this bad, how much worse can it get and took the remainder of my margin and bought another 20k worth of Tesla 0DTE options. 

By some miracle, I guess holiday spirit coupled with the pce data, Tesla rallied almost 40$ from its low of 410 in the morning. I didn’t quite make up all of the loss from Mstr and the Tesla calls but I ended the day with my account back above 100k by the end of the day. 

That weekend I swore to turn off margin trading and to disable options in my account. 

Yea right 

This past week I made many trades, all Tesla day trades, with the same strategy, going in with 30-40k and selling for 10-20% profits on small moves. (Some days I was down 10k just to go in with more money to make back 11k) I’m up about 20k this week, up 50k from the lowest last Friday. 

I did also lose 5k on /ES on Friday. 

I’m just over 10k away from making back all the losses of those terrible that ruined my ski holiday. 

Do I disable margin and options like I said I would last weekend or do I continue?",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hot2it,193,2024-12-29 11:07:28,"

19,How to invest in broad market minus a few stocks?,"Most of my money's in index funds, but there are a few stocks that I don't believe are worth paying for.

I pretty much want an index fund like VOO minus a few stocks such as APPL, TSLA, MSTR (especially TSLA and MSTR). Idealy a financial institution would provide a bunch (500+) check boxes for each compaany (sorted by market cap) where by default it buys the same fraction of each stock.

Essentially I want to create a custom index fund where my custom fund has almost every notable company in the USA or the world. I like being lazy and do not want to buy 500+ stocks ever time I get a paycheck.

From googling around there are services that offer something called ""direct indexing"" but I don't see why buying / selling a market proportional ammount should cost 0.4% / year. I also do not understand why there would need to be ""rebalancing"" since ETFs such as VOO own (throwing out a number) 5% of everything and buy / sell as people buy / sell the ETF.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hodyic/how_to_invest_in_broad_market_minus_a_few_stocks/,3,2024-12-28 21:03:52,"It's actually pretty straight-forward and there are a few ways to do this.

1. Short the equal amount of shares of the ETF.
2. Use an SMA where the manager supports restrictions and add your restrictions
3. Use direct index products where you create your own index.

yes - you have to rebalance because market cap indices change when the value of the underlying changes. Also  - there may be index changes. If you want to follow an index - that index will reconstitute and rebalance. 

Not sure what you mean about the fee - these are not free services.

I assume you realize that adding restrictions to an index means that you are introducing a tracking error and changing the beta.; I like this idea of a “create your own adventure” (c) S&P500. Perhaps one of the platforms will make this a (nearly) free feature with all the competition and desire to differentiate themselves.

I’d probably try it to see if I could beat the S&P. But I wouldn’t want to pay extra because I probably can’t.; Here is an alternative to direct indexing, might work out cheaper:

20,Initial Investment Advice ,"Alright, I'm thinking about putting $200 away for some initial savings. I'm 19 so all the time to let It grow, but I want a good return on my investment.

I have 3 options:

1. Open a Share Term Account: Higher Interest, but slower growth at 4.4% APY



2. Invest In KO and hold It: Bacardi and Coke are doing a collab In '25, maybe when that drops shares should see some good return. I'd own about 3.3 Shares. 




3. Invest In SPY ETF: Really eyeing this one, think for longterm growth this Is my best option. 

For context I'm on disability, In Job Corps for Welding, I.e get an additional pay of $41 every other week (yes not the most, but everything else Is covered, and I mean everything. It's a sweet deal honestly). That means I get a sum of $407 a month, once I pay my phone and credit card. 

I'm thinking halfing that monthly to $200, most likely $150, In additional investments. Out of the 3 options, which would lead me to see some good growth? Any other ETF'S I should know of?",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hobj5f/initial_investment_advice/,6,2024-12-28 19:14:44,"Forget about option #2. Every other investor already has that info and it's priced in. 

SPY is your best bet, but instead buy something comparable with lower expense such as VOO.; Robinhood or Cashapp lets you buy $50/week automatically of VOO. Just set that up. As your income increases, increase your weekly amount to what you can. Do that all your life. You won’t have money issues. You will start to understand how it works. Just keep increasing your automatic. Never get rid of your automatic. You don’t have to buy whole shares, it will just buy what the $50 corresponds to.; Damn, what does priced In mean? Like everyone knows It's worth now or something?

I'll look Into VOO, as It stands SPY Is $595.01, which means $200 Is jack, unless .33 shares grow. Not like Vanguards significantly cheaper, but I'll look Into both. SPY was the plan; hard liquor sales are in the dump as well; Sweet, think that's the plan, another comment recommended I read up, so I'll get wise before doing anything. What does ""automatic"" refer to?; Yes basically. Anytime you read about news that could affect the price of a stock - 99% of the time, others learned this info way before you did, and already bought/sold accordingly. [Here's an article](https://lifetimefinancial.com/the-lifetime-blog/the-most-important-investing-concept-you-wont-find-explained-on-the-internet) on the concept.

And the price per share of SPY vs VOO is meaningless. Whether you own 1 share or 0.33 share, both would have gained the same percentage growth over the course of a year. Just like half a dollar is the same as 50 cents. The benefit of VOO is that you are charged less in fees. Focus on the $ value of your current holdings and not the # of shares owned. 

I recommend Fidelity as a brokerage so you can buy fractional shares of anything. That way the price per share is never a deterrent from buying what you want.; SCHX is basically VOO but Schwab does splits every now and then, so the share price is cheaper. I buy that instead of VOO because I can't do fractional shares in my brokerage. It's \~23 bucks now.; Automatic means you buy VOO on a recurring basis for a dollar amount. $100 every Friday for example. If it can’t buy a whole share it will buy a fractional of the share. This automates. This means you don’t have to log in every week to do it. Never rely on your own discipline. Automate. Increase that weekly if you can. Lower the weekly if you MUST. Always have a weekly. And soon you will see money is easy. Just that habit will force you to prioritize your future. If you notice little growth, you are likely putting in little effort. Compare your weekly to your bills. If your bills are way more than your weekly, then you are not living below your means. Your bills have more importance than your future. Good luck!; That's what I was hoping to hear, on share price of SPY, VOO, or any other ETF/MF. Will most likely Invest In both, but for now eyeing one. Either seems like a good choice honestly.

 Preciate' the article, totally let down the current price Is whats projected considering It's lower than the yearly peak of $73 bucks. You'd think an official collab would've boosted It more handsomely, but I digress.

Currently use Webull, all the same It allows fractional shares too right?; Looks like It's down, but the 6 month chart shows so good growth. Sounds good, but hope this trend of going down doesn't persist. Suppose that's the risk factor, could get about 8.6 shares with an initial $200 investment. 

What broker you use? I'm using Webull, may look Into Fidelity.; Thought so, just confirming. Exactly like auto-pay on bills. Lucky for me I only have one real bill, phone, my credit card Is a given. 

Def will be forgetting to log In, busy with trade school and junk. Better every week? Was thinking more monthly, or fractional weekly, whole on the first of each month.

Really appreciate this, what brokerage you use? I use Webull, but eyeing Fidelity. Does It really matter all the same If they both can do fractionals?; I gotta be honest. And I mean this in the nicest way, since we all had to start from scratch: You really should read a good book or two to get the fundamentals of investing. The fact that you want to buy both SPY and VOO tells me you really aren't sure how any of this stuff works. And that's ok!

Reddit is not the place to learn the basics. It's great for fine-tuning a plan, but you need a comprehensive step-by-step guide on what to do (and why it makes sense) to really internalize this stuff. The idea of a book may sound boring compared to just googling/redditing random questions, but I promise you the education is priceless (and actually much faster than trying to piecemeal it together with 500 google searches). A few that helped me get started:

Should be pretty darn close to VOO though. The holdings are about 99% the same.; Weekly is better in my experience. Monday or Friday. Doesn’t matter. The broker doesn’t matter either. Robinhood is easy to setup on the phone. Cashapp lets you do it too. Fidelity allows weekly auto with fractional buys. The main thing is to automate and have some mechanism to remind you to increase that weekly. The more you can do, the better. VOO or QQQM is fine. Auto, weekly, increase weekly when possible. Don’t rely on self discipline. Keep it simple. There is more to learn. But if you truly do a strong weekly, the answers work themselves out. Anything worth investing in has an option for auto weekly somewhere. Good luck!!; This Is the comment I was looking for, rather read some books on this. I have rough plan, but wasn't going to execute In both anyways without further knowledge. Will be saving this, see If the local library has these.

Don't forget saving bookmarks you end up forgetting that already has the answer you need. 

Much appreciated, thank you.; So they did, to be expected all the same I suppose. Not sure the time I'm expecting It to grow anyways, just plan to take a shot In the dark. Invest, see how It looks In February, then move from there."
21,The New Normal in Asset Valuation,"With a “slight” delay, I finally watched *The Big Short*. Highly recommend it—excellent movie.

It got me thinking about how much the world has changed in the past 15 years. The 2007-2008 crisis was all about financiers selling bad products as good ones—until reality broke through the glitter, and the bubble burst. The protagonist of the film bet against the system as soon as he realized the product was fundamentally flawed. And he relatively easily waited for the explosion to occur. Truth prevailed quickly.

Now, things are completely different. We’ve been living in a well-known, yet unpopped bubble for years. Take Apple, for instance. It’s objectively a very good company. I like their products, I buy the new iPhone and AirPods, and I even own some of their shares. I’m by no means saying it’s a bad investment. But let’s examine it the way Burry and his colleagues looked at bonds—asking, “What’s really behind that AAA rating?”

It’s much easier for us now than it was for them. For our “investigation,” there’s no need to talk to exotic dancers or drive through dusty backwaters. Everything is right there in the public reports. The most basic figures, clear as day, show that today’s Apple is not a stock of future growth. It’s a classic cash cow: stable, profitable, but not growing. Adjusted for inflation, it’s actually a shrinking business. Net profit? $100 billion a year. Nearly all of it, with some extra, is distributed as dividends and buybacks. The company hasn’t released a genuinely successful new product in 10 years. Antitrust regulators aren’t fond of it. There’s no sign of explosive growth ahead, but the risk of a sharp decline exists.

What’s such a business objectively worth? Strictly less than a “risk-free” U.S. Treasury bond yielding $100 billion in coupons annually. How much less? You could write two volumes debating how to assess business risks. But it’s less—risk compared to no risk at the same yield. (Yes, U.S. Treasuries have risk too, but if “the dollar collapses,” the government would likely tax Apple into oblivion first.)

The 30-year bond we need costs $2.2 trillion today. Apple? $3.4 trillion. That’s an extra trillion right there. A trillion, Carl! The hole in 2007 was larger, but even then, a trillion would’ve been noticeable in the context of the entire crisis. And here I picked just one company, almost at random, and it’s a good company.

Everyone sees this; all the numbers are public. I haven’t discovered America here. Tons of independent analysts and experts predict a global crash based on similar logic—exactly like Burry once did. Many people believe them year after year, short the market, and lose money doing it. Meanwhile, the market keeps climbing, and whether it will actually collapse someday, nobody knows. For now, everything’s steadily growing; the pandemic records have long been surpassed. This isn’t 2007. Reality no longer breaks through the glitter.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ho8md2/the_new_normal_in_asset_valuation/,45,2024-12-28 17:02:12,"2008 was a credit crunch , like in simple terms banks borrow money at 4% and loan it out and get 4.1%

that 0.1% return is not much unless you leverage up, borrow a trillion dollars at 4% loan it out at 4.1% now that .1% of a trillion is a lot of money (overly simplified terms)

This is why a credit crunch is so bad, if your loans go bad well now you owe a lot of money , if your loans now only return 3.9% well now you are losing a lot of money 

The 2000 dot com bubble didn't affect the economy as bad as it wasn't a credit crunch , sure stock prices bubbled then popped but the underlying economy was still growing, there was not credit crunch

So even if there is an AI bubble and it burst and stocks go down 40% because investors realize AI is not going to pay off and revalue those companies , it might not cause a huge amount of real economic pain (unemployment , negative GDP growth); This seems like a flawed analysis. As I understand it, your argument is:

1. Apple pays out $100 billion in dividends and buybacks annually
2. You would need $2.2 trillion of US treasuries to collect $100 billion in interest annually 
3. Apple stock is riskier than US treasuries and also Apple has zero prospects for growth so Apple stock should be worth less than $2.2 trillion
4. Apple stock is worth $3.4 trillion
5. Therefore Apple is overvalued and the market is in a bubble 

I think the problem with your argument is #3 — it’s an extremely tenuous assumption.; If you liked the movie, read the book, Michael Lewis has a fantastic ability to explain complex ideas through interesting characters. The movie did a good job on the book though.; Not really sure where i read it, i'm lacking i'm that regard, but if you adjust the values of stock today by the M2 (money supply) the stock market is lower than in '00.; How much in TIPS is required to get $100B annually in coupon payments, which will adjust upward with inflation?

I’m guessing more than $3.4T…; > Strictly less than a “risk-free” U.S. Treasury bond yielding $100 billion in coupons annually. How much less?... The 30-year bond we need costs $2.2 trillion today. Apple? $3.4 trillion. 

You are forgetting that Apple (like almost all stocks) is an inflation-adjusted bond, using earnings yield. Prices for goods sold and bought both go up at approximately the rate of inflation so margin goes up with inflation.  That puts the yield at 2.276% (i.e. the TIPs yield).  Which gets you $3.623t using your math. 

BTW as someone who was investing back in 2005-8, lots of normal people knew the quality of housing bonds were really bad.  The argument was that:

1. Housing was a local market and there couldn't be a national decline in housing prices.  A diversified portfolio of mortgages was much safer than the underlying individual mortgages.  

2. A belief the underlying quality of the mortgages were better than what anecdotally people were seeing. 

Those scenes with the exotic dancer were about (2).  The Jenga blocks scene was about (1) (though really the movie didn't address it). 

I'm not saying Apple isn't overpriced.  There should be a risk premium.  Part of the problem with comparing to bonds is the bond market is screwed up, though perhaps starting to normalize.; >We’ve been living in a well-known, yet unpopped bubble for years


Did you miss the entirety of 2022 and 2023? June 2022 SPY closed 20% lower than it started the year at, popping the covid market bubble. It then took SPY another year to get back to previous levels. Valuations are insane right now but hard to call it a bubble.; Just look up the equity ETF AuM from 2000 until today, we went up from 102 billions to 7,87 trilions, that alone should tell you a lot about the stock markets growth; Warren isn't wrong.; >Everyone sees this; all the numbers are public

The difference isn't between then and now, it's in the nature of the securities. In 2008, all the numbers were NOT public. No one knew what was inside these complex bundled bond instruments. The public depended on the ratings agencies' valuations, and the rating agencies either didn't understand how to rate these instruments or were colluding with the banks in how risky they assessed them to be. 

There have been periods of irrational exuberance about the valuations of equities and it could be that we are in one now, but these values are not opaque and hidden from view the way the credit valuations were leading up to the Great Financial Crisis. We have Apple's financial statements. If we're so inclined, we can each make our own educated guess about what the stock is worth. This was never the case with the mortgage-backed securities and CDOs that crashed in 2008.; In regards to Apple, you're missing **services** as the breakout success over the last decade. It accounts for over a quarter of Apple's revenue, second only to iPhone. 

If you take iPhone revenue out of the equation, services makes more for Apple than all other operating segments combined.  
  
Also Apple keeps a lot of its cash offshore, mainly to avoid taxes it doesn't have to pay until it needs to, right now Apple can borrow any cash it needs at very attractive rates.   

Lastly, I think many don't realize that Apple's next big blockbuster product will be financial services, within its Apple Pay ecosystem, it captures a 0.15% fee on all transactions regardless the card issuer; scale that across a multi-trillion dollar frictionless ecosystem it positions Apple as a growth company for the next decade.

I think Apple is fairly priced.; Apple bashing thread. lol; Yup, the investment banks were leveraged up to their tits. Nobody was being responsible when it came to leverage ratios - neither the lenders, nor the borrowers. Everybody was borrowing and lending massive amounts of money that would bankrupt them if *anything* went wrong - but would allow them to make massive amounts of money if anything went right. The Big Short focused on the CDOs, but they were incidental - anything could have lit the match. 

If John lends *all* of his money to Jake, who lends all of that money to Alex, who lends all of it that money to Chris, and Chris blows the money at Las Vegas, then one stupid choice just made *four* people bankrupt. Like a chain reaction.; Even financially literate people still struggle to disconnect stock market valuations from the real economy.

A modern economy cannot function for more than a couple of hours, maybe even seconds, without credit. In 2008 the credit system froze completely - banks refused to lend to each other, let alone the public. GE couldn’t turn over their commercial paper, so they couldn’t pay wage bills or order parts.

This had a connection to asset prices - in this case housing - but a popping of a bubble doesn’t necessarily cause a recession. If the banks didn’t panic and credit didn’t freeze like it did, then you could make the argument 2008 wouldn’t have been that bad. Yes the banks would’ve booked massive losses, and you would still probably have had a recession, but without a credit crunch an economy can limp its way through until lending picks back up.

2008 is absolutely fascinating to me, one of my favourite topics to read about. We came as close as we will probably ever come to a complete collapse of the financial system. Yet, especially here in Australia, no one really cared that much. 

This is what the Big Short doesn’t go into, and fair enough, because it’s pretty boring to the average punter. Too Big Too Fail does a much better job showing the credit crisis unfolding imo.; That, and a bond pays a nominal, fixed amount. Apple is a company, with real capital, that produces real goods/services that is not fixed in price or value. Even if Apple never grows again its nominal profit will simply increase from inflation. Even if I think Apple is overvalued I may rather hold it than a 30 year treasury which has a significant chance of losing substantial value if inflation is higher than expected.; He didn't say anything about $100 b in dividends??

He said  net profit; Its true, spx/m2 is lower than '99-00. But that is basically the only time in history it is lol; Thats like saying the world is more peaceful today than 1944.; 4T, Apple is a 17% discount to that; You would need a 4 trillion dollar TIPS 30 year bond to yield 100 billion - current rate is 2.5%. Apple is trading at a 17% risk discount if we take that view."

If you expect interest rates to be lower, yes.; Yes.  It is my biggest bet at the moment.  I keep trying to figure out why I should be concerned about Honey.  Still haven't figured out why I should be upset.; Totally. The volume of payments and user base is enormous. 450+ million users...global...; I am not trying to be a choad with this question. Why were you reluctant to buy the stock at $60? Probably because of all the articles saying it would be crushed by competition. Now that the price has risen, you have taken comfort from that fact alone. This is not the best framework for finding investment ideas. 

The ATH is very unlikely to be exceeded any time soon.

I own Paypal. I took a risk in the low $60s because when every article in the financial press (and the journalists in the financial press are morons who only parrot what someone else is telling them) hated the stock.  Every time I asked someone about it, I got the canned answer from the negative headlines. This is when you should be interested. 

Look at Hershey. If you google articles, all anyone is writing about and worrying about is the spike in cocoa prices. Look at a cocoa long term chart. There have been several speculative spikes in cocoa prices over the decades. The same thing always happens. Supply increases, prices crash. 

Buy $HSY now.; They were a screaming buy at $60.  They are fine to own now but certainly nothing special. There has been enough multiple expansion in conjunction with better sentiment and good earnings. I am looking to sell them at 100.  There have to be better opportunities around.

I will go all in if it finds itself back at $70.; I think PYPL is a buy. IMO - V and MA are better longer term holds; If you like PYPL, you’ll love SQ; Yes. It’s my biggest holding. I got in at $58. But this is not financial advice.; Isn’t SQ better?; A  underrated fintech value stock? I wonder…; One can add a bit. Many analysts disagree while some day it can turn around.; I sold half on the Honey fraud news, still deciding what to do with the other half

It’s at a technical resistance level, and probably depends on how rest of the market goes from here.

If an actual lawsuit drops, there will be a sell off, but maybe that is still some time in the future

Depends on your mid term market outlook and how you want to bet on it in 2025; Help me to understand their business. I personally don't use Paypal much, only for some random purchases from unfamiliar websites that don't offer Apple Pay. In 5 years, will more transactions be done with Paypal, or fewer?; I saw people asking the same thing going into 2024; SQ is better; I'll use some AI to pull data and illustrate why it trades the way it does:

Here are PayPal's annual revenues over the last five years, along with their corresponding growth rates:

- *2024*: $31.457 billion, an 8% increase from 2023 ¹
- *2023*: $29.771 billion, an 8.19% increase from 2022 ¹
- *2022*: $27.518 billion, an 8.46% increase from 2021 ¹
- *2021*: $25.371 billion, an 18.26% increase from 2020 ¹
- *2020*: $21.454 billion ¹

These growth rates indicate a steady increase in PayPal's annual revenue over the past five years, with a notable surge in 2021.

PayPal's free cash flow has seen significant fluctuations over the years. Here's a breakdown of their annual free cash flow:

- *2023*: $4.265 billion, a 16.57% decline from 2022 ¹
- *2022*: $5.112 billion, a 4.45% increase from 2021 ¹
- *2021*: $4.894 billion, a 10.58% decline from 2020 ¹
- *2020*: $5.473 billion ¹
- *2019*: $3.384 billion ¹

You will see higher prices like $300 in a very long time if the growth rates are stagnant, if they decline is will take even longer (well over a decade, you can do the math if you wish). It can happen quickly if the growth rates resume to the levels they were at when it was trading at $300. $300 it was growing at 20-25% annually now it's not even half of that. 

I've had a PayPal for over 20 years (not the stock), you could have done well buying it this year but you could have done well also buying complete garbage companies that had no business going up 50-70% or whatever it did. Personally I don't see the growth rates increasing like they did in the past at this point, Braintree is doing well but it would take ages before it makes up for a meaningful proportion of business. This is the reason I haven't bought it personally.

You could pick worse, it's at least growing modestly and profitable like a more mature company, it's fairly priced at the moment unless you think it will accelerate. If it decelerates further it is highly likely you will lose money.; I was bullish at $55-60, but at current prices I'd say no, they paid $4 Billion for honey which turned out to be a huge scam and will probably face lawsuits, and their core business faces a lot of competition.; I've owned it for a quite a while, not really sure what to do with it. My pops ran a scan on it using his software and he thinks it's going to $75, which would have me worried.; I think there are a lot more better opportunities but PYPL is not terrible compared to the other stocks on Reddit.; Google pay and Apple pay killed Paypal and Venmo. IRS also passed a new rule. If you receive more than $600 in paypal or Venno then 1099-k form will be issued. You need to pay taxes. To avoid this, everyone is now using Zelle transfers.; Paypal Mafia; Nah, this is like betting on WordPerfect against Word while Microsoft owns the entire ecosystem they run on; This has been my go to tax loss harvesting stock since 2021. That says something. I’m still harvesting my loses since 2021.; No. Paypal owns Honey, the browser extension, which will be sued, given the very strong argument from Megalag. check it out on YouTube, it’s crazy; nah, but a great tax loss harvester for 2024; Way too much competition in the fintech space, which has definitely played a big role in their steadily declining Gross Margin over the years.

Plus IMO as a non-Paypal user I would never dare touch them with a ten foot pole. I've heard WAY too many people say bad things about them on both ends of the transaction for me to ever trust them with my money. And if I'd never use their products as a user, then there's no way that I'm ever touching their stock. Maybe I'm wrong about them, but if I don't trust them enough to use their products then I can't possibly be impartial when evaluating the stock.; Past performance does not guarantee future results. Notsure how the ceo will turn this company around.; Nah they banned me. Buy Puts; Dinausore company with a dividend yield of 0%. Too expensive.; I or have heard of anyone else using paypal for years. Its done. For a fork in it.; I sold pypl last week lol. this ain't coming back up to 300 in a lifetime. Lol. Too many players in this space. Apple, Google, Square, Stripe, RazorPay might eventually win over PayPal.; I wouldn't. You be you; Paypal is no longer anything unique or leading. There are tons of alternatives and they are loosing popularity. With rise of other cash apps they are loosing their place under sun; Run; Avoid; Their moat is gone and they have too many rivals...  That being said I have used them since 1999 when I first started an eBay business.. I think there are better ideas out there; It is trap!; I cant think of a reason for paypal and ebay to exist; Hell no. Ever used them as a business theyre a nightmare also they push extreme leftist ideology.; Genuinely don’t know anyone that uses it . My homies and I all use Zelle; They lost their mojo, it's the IBM of fintechs; Pypl is dogshit and they’re kind of a piece of shit company too; dont bother 

these halfway through tech/ finance companies, are pointless

they operate at way too low margins for either or, and they have an awful reputation for withholding peoples money and such 

they dont have anything proprietary, and if any growth at all, is linear and predictable; Honey lawsuit could be an absolute disaster; Here's what I know about PayPal. I used to be good at World of Warcraft back in the day. Could throw a Fireball over them there mountains. Like ""fuck you"" good, do you hear me? I had bitches that would dance on the Ironforge mailbox when I'd walk by with my ""Gladiator"" title. 


People wanted to be me. You understand? They were willing to *pay me money* to pretend to be the internet Ass Slayer that I was. So I'd sell some high school incel in Alabama that stole his mama's credit card my account for $300 or $400 there was even an entire website dedicated to it called Markeedragon. 


So we'd use PayPal and I'd tell the pathetic loser trying to be as godlike as me that they needed to open a dispute on the transaction once I gave them my account info and then cancel the dispute. For reasons. PayPal was such a shit company that once you had opened a dispute and closed it, even if it was 3 seconds later, you could not reopen a dispute for the same transaction. Period. Even if you called and asked for a supervisor.


So once they did that my not pathetic and actually awesome self would just do the routine account recovery at Blizzard's website because back then Blizzard was actually a company sent from heaven and get my account back. Whole process would take like an hour from making an advertisement post on the forum to ruining some kid's life and having the money in my bank account. 


All thanks to PayPal. Made me the man I am today.; Kinda similar, i ended up cutting my losses with PYPL this year and put the money into an S&P 500 ETF and SOXQ. Only upside is tax harvesting for this year ; Could you explain your reasoning? All I understand so far from your comment is that you were buying the stock at crazy high prices but once it became actually cheap you don't buy; a ridiculous line of thinking in my opinion. So it must be something else.; How much you lost? Dollar amount; No one truly cares about this crap other than the Internet.; How much do you think this will affect paypal as a whole?; I wouldn't stop using Honey just because some influencers might not get their commission from affiliate links. Sounds to me like an influencer problem not a consumer problem.

I'd rather have $10 knocked off the price using a coupon I didn't know about vs some YouTuber getting their commission.; He’s got a great professional reputation.; I bought a lot at the bottom cause my dcf said it was undervalued. Now it says is close to fair value. I'm selling week by week. But also buying until I find a better stock; We have the exact same outlook.; How much do you think it will affect papyal as a whole; Snap $58.086, to be exact.; New way better ceo, beating expectations, pivoting to more profitable businesses.; Yep, I cannot make an account there for the life of me and I can't get support to help me either.

Even if I wanted to invest, I personally won't.

Paypal has likely screwed tons and tons of people as well.  I have read lots of horror stories about people losing their money and Paypal just does not care. 

Death to Paypal.; You don't even understand the issue. Honey is deceiving consumers.; Its called fraud; What motivates you to own HSY?  From what I see with a quick google check they are stagnant and trading at a 25 PE.  If you can give me a quick rundown because I love beaten down value.; Why?; The average older person in the street knows what PayPal is and what it's for and have used them it for decades. They don't know who the other guys are, and they are the ones with all the money right now and spend billions. They aren't suddenly all going to change to new brands they aren't  familiar with or trust yet overnight. It's a brand. Maybe further down the rd, it will happen. Do you trust the other brands more? Why on what footing?

Some statistics for you:

PayPal generated $29.2 billion revenue in 2023, an 7.9% increase year-on-year

PayPal net profit increased by 75% in 2023 to $4.2 billion

25 billion transactions were completed on PayPal in 2023, accounting for $1.52 trillion in transaction volume

431 million users and merchants use PayPal

It might take a while for the others to catch up.; Do you think they realized they were banning investors?

Everyone they fucked over...

Couldn't happen to a shittier company; Dividends suck.; If you’re a collector, eBay is the only legit game in town. I’m buying basketball cards off eBay damn near everyday and pay with PayPal.; I use PayPal as a proxy to pay for online purchases with a credit card. I don’t want every website to have my CC info.; You don't need to think of a reason, go read about what it does, you don't need to have an imagination to understand it lol; huh? it's literally a marketplace for anything. other services have stolen marketshare but it's legacy and will never die; Sometimes Ebay has decent deals but don’t understand Paypal existing; Etf goes down too during market crash ; ... PayPal is an Internet facing business though, it simply isn't possible to use it's products and services without it.

Your response to me sounds like someone saying ""no one cares that the owner of the local grocery store went to jail except for the locals"".; It will not affect paypal. No one can prove they lost money because only the last click will be saved as a datapoint. At best it will be an “im sorry” from honey and promises they will be more transparent in the future. They will rewrite the terms making it clear they will take your money.; Not sure but I dont like Paypal as a company in general. From scamming creators of their money, to withholding certain creator money accounts, to this Honey stuff, deceptive practises could lead to some big lawsuits. Just my two cents , DYOR; Honey controls coupon you get. So even if there is better deal you won’t get it. I rather do quick search perplexity to find one.; Yikes, you really dont know. 

It does not just hurt influencers. It also hurts consumers.

They can and do intentionally hide better discounts so you pay more money and they get more commission. 

They also sometimes intentionally dont show a coupon is available at all, when one actually is available. Meaning in many cases someone can be better off googling coupons for a few minutes instead of using Honey.; You clearly havent done your research lmao.

Honey is not only scamming the influencers but also consumers. They literally provide you with codes that do not work. Simple google searches provide you with better codes, theyre intercepting browsers with unwanted cookies and profiting off your data.

watch MegaLag’s video for more info; So you're selling it and buying it back at the same time? How's that work?; 50/50 either it goes up or it goes down; 25 PE is quite normal for HSY. The company reliably generates a 25% return on capital. My motivation is that earnings are suppressed by the short term spike in cocoa prices. That will reverse. The company will earn $12/ share in a few years. 25X12=$300 stock.; Well played; Dividends will prevent the stock price to go down and will add upside potential with annual dividend growth.

This is not a fast growing tech company, this a a payment processing company in a mature industry full of competitors.; Also good for discontinued stuff. Fragrances and other collectible shit.; Why are you saving your credit card info to websites?; At least from a consumer perspective in Germany it’s the easiest way to easily transfer money between friends to split a dinner after paying etc. as we don’t have access to apps like Venmo, that are available in for example the US. 

For every other use case there are better substitutes imo.; If spy goes down 80% were all fucked; Literally nobody cares.  Its like Albertsons buying a local grocer somewhere and them raising prices a little bit and the town griping a little bit.  Thats it.; No one cares about the honey debacle except terminally online, parasocial internet users. Which is a very few amount of people; I think there won’t even be a “we’re sorry” as that’s an admission of guilt; No surprise Peter Theil would be behind these practices.  The guy is obviously spending a boat load on PR right now to fix his image, but the fact is, he's just an incredibly self-centered person with a ruthless approach to business.; Woosh bro; One of those two things will definitely happen; Both calls and puts moment lmao; But why is a 25PE normal for a mature company paying dividends with stagnant growth?  

And why should I pay for 12/share in a few years today?; There could be some benefit though I'd rather them buy back shares instead of increasing my tax liability.; I never mentioned saving. I meant transmitting my CC info to online shops. Who the fuck knows what they do with it after.; Which other use cases and which substitutes?; You don't think people who are investing in a company care that said company is involved in a scam of likely 100s of millions of dollars? 🤡 Take; lol. The softest critique of Theil that’s humanly possible.; How did you come to that conclusion; Paying for stuff on websites mostly and substitutes for that are basically all credit and debit cards.; Taking hundreds of millions of dollars is why it’s a good buy. That’s how I know management is doing good!😂; I am investing in pypl and don´t really care honostly. Too many bullish things going on with the main businesses; Scam? For doing what all cashback sites do?; The same way you decided to ask this question; Yeah. The Honey thing is annoying but for Wall Street it’s nothing to write home about. It’s not a ball busting scandal on national news. It’s annoying but it *really doesn’t matter all that much*."
23,$GSAT: The Overlooked Satellite Company With Extraterrestrial Potential,"**TLDR: Globalstar’s outsized role in Low-Earth Orbit communications and recent equity partnership with Apple will provide substantial future cash flows and support rapid growth. Price target is $5, but will very likely extend far above this valuation.**  


Globalstar ($GSAT) provides Mobile Satellite Services through its satellite constellations worldwide. More specifically, they provide cellular data and enable cellular communication, satellite monitoring of ground assets by governments, emergency service to remote areas, and utilization of their frequency spectrums authorized by the FCC and ITU (most importantly). 

[Globalstar recognizes revenue from its Spectrums under the “Wholesale capacity services” segment, and its respective 51&#37; and 31&#37; increases for the 3\/9 month periods ending in 2024 compared to 2023 illustrates its importance as a driver of operating profits.](https://preview.redd.it/7aitpeu2ug9e1.png?width=1099&format=png&auto=webp&s=79a85edf5fb76472b8c076573edd6d8861479b5c)

[Revenue has been steadily increasing, even through rocky macroeconomics](https://preview.redd.it/o1b7g5ecug9e1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=be6fa6c5d32200883db22aff0379bde53bbb2e96)

Authorizations for ownership of terrestrial spectrums are often lengthy endeavors and require a demonstration of competence by any company seeking them. The fact that Globalstar has secured L-band and S-band spectrum authorizations gives it a massive competitive advantage and access to a wider variety of international populations and markets than competitors.



In addition to this competitive advantage, Apple recently initiated a 20% stake in the company and provided them with $1.1 billion in funding (paid in quarterly installments) to pay down debts and for use of their services. This 20% equity stake emphasizes that Apple views Globalstar as a company with significant growth potential rather than a simple operating partner. 



And it’s not just Apple buying in either…  


https://preview.redd.it/k0m4nv9mug9e1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ad21bd9dc33f91d8cf73c39078fa1488521138c

Institutional ownership of Globalstar is up across the board, with names like JPMorgan and Fidelity rebalancing their investments and taking stakes outright.

I believe that Globalstar’s current undervaluation is due to its historic balance sheet weakness and continued share dilution. However, the $1.1B in funding from Apple provides it with a solid runway and cushion from debt. 

More recently, they filed to effect a reverse stock split. This split would address their ongoing share dilution issues, provide additional liquidity for lot trading (blocks of 100 shares that benefit from lower commissions and fees), and a path to NASDAQ listing.

I believe that this company’s valuation currently reflects outdated historic data, and is not priced appropriately given these most recent developments. The consensus price target is currently set at $5, but having been beaten down for nearly 2 decades, I would expect any spark to ignite a rally that extends far above this target.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hnqndn/gsat_the_overlooked_satellite_company_with/,166,2024-12-27 23:21:44,"# **TLDR**

---

**Ticker:** GSAT

**Direction:** Up

**Prognosis:** Strong Buy

**Price Target:** $5 (but potentially much higher)

**Reasoning:**  Globalstar ($GSAT) is undervalued due to past balance sheet issues, but a recent $1.1B investment from Apple (20% equity stake) and increasing institutional ownership signals significant future growth potential.  A planned reverse stock split should improve liquidity and pave the way for a NASDAQ listing.  Revenue is also significantly increasing.; Is Globalstar the website where all the black kids yell ""GlobalStar Hip-Hop!"" Before they fight each other?; Position:

Jeez how underutilized was their network lol; how do their satellites compare to Starlink? If it's like 20yr old tech, seems pretty useless for any future needs.

On the surface ASTS looks way more promising; I feel there are other opportunities following Apple's purchase.; Apple already was their largest customer, with 85% network capacity allocated exclusively to them; Nevermind. Grok to the rescue. GSAT doesn't seem like much growth capabilities based on the below.

how does $GSAT satellites compare to Starlink's constellation of satellites

Comparing Globalstar ($GSAT) satellites to Starlink's constellation involves looking at several key aspects such as satellite numbers, technology, service capabilities, and operational strategies:  
Number and Scale of Satellites:

* Starlink: As of recent updates, Starlink boasts a constellation of over 6,000 satellites, with plans to expand to significantly more. This large number of satellites allows for extensive coverage and redundancy, aiming to provide global broadband internet service from low Earth orbit (LEO).
* Globalstar: Globalstar operates with a much smaller constellation, currently around 48 satellites, focusing on satellite phone and low-speed data services rather than high-speed broadband.

Orbit and Technology:

* Starlink: Utilizes LEO satellites at approximately 550 km altitude, which results in lower latency and higher data transfer rates compared to traditional geostationary orbit (GEO) satellites. Starlink satellites are equipped with advanced technology like space lasers for inter-satellite communication, enhancing the network's efficiency.
* Globalstar: Its satellites are in LEO but at a higher altitude than Starlink's, around 1,414 km. They primarily use S-band for communication, which is more suited for voice and basic data services rather than high-speed internet.

Service and Coverage:

* Starlink: Aims for global coverage, offering high-speed internet with speeds up to 220 Mbps, though actual speeds can vary. It's targeting both residential and mobile users, including those in remote areas where traditional internet infrastructure is lacking.
* Globalstar: Focuses on providing reliable satellite phone services, IoT solutions, and asset tracking. While it does offer data services, these are not as comprehensive or fast as Starlink's offerings, being more geared towards niche markets like emergency communications, maritime, and rural areas where even basic connectivity is needed.

Business Model and Market Position:

* Starlink: Operates on a subscription model, with a significant upfront cost for the user terminal (dish) and monthly fees. It has rapidly expanded its user base, targeting millions of subscribers globally.
* Globalstar: Has a different market focus, with services aimed at specific sectors rather than mass consumer broadband. Its business model includes contracts with government and industrial users for communications solutions.

In summary, while both companies operate LEO satellite systems, Starlink focuses on high-speed internet with a massive satellite constellation for global coverage, whereas Globalstar emphasizes reliability and specialized communication services with a smaller satellite network. Their technologies, market focuses, and scale of operations differ significantly.; 1/10 r/s are done by companies on their way UP, this is one

If GSAT takes a hit due to the split I am buying as many shares as I can get my hands on; Appreciate your honesty DJ, that is a good question.; The future I’m seeing is quantum satellite communication. 

China’s already done it, and Globalstar is already positioned to make the pivot.; Thats X4 leverage only, not that cheap; See my post.; As of 2025 it will offer voice memos but realtime two-way talk is further out; Yes, that's the whole aim to make text messaging easier.  I think that's the reason why Apple bought 20% of GStar; JM?; ASTS has had too many convenient delays, private placement warrants outstanding, and fair value of warrant liability miscalculations that make me extremely nervous to be an investor; 👍🙌Also…New Globalstar CEO Paul Jacob’s (former CEO of Qualcomm) and many of his people followed him to Globalstar!; You lack patience brother; ...and might also have been priced in.; No I wrote the last one in 2022, this one is more up to date; Completely different business model, not in competition with starlink; january what, 17th?; They have the option to split, but if natural demand drives the price higher then they won’t necessarily need to. Either way, I expect the price appreciation pre or post-split to be the same.; SpaceX doesn’t have the authorization for 1.6/2.4 GHz frequency bands, which allows for military channels and undisrupted access due to hardly any congestion. 

SpaceX petitioned the FCC for authorization but was denied, so they use a common channel and adjust their tech to work as well as it can in that congested band.

Currently, only GSAT and Iridium have access.; Care to back that up brother or are we just saying stuff; Hahaha.  I couldn't find Worldstar on Hargreaves.; So it is going to reverse?; It’s Valhalla or government assistance for us now brother; I took a long-term equity position - I don’t have any calls. I would go for the Jan 17th 1.5 though if you plan on trading options and see if you can get it for $60-65. Otherwise, you can buy 100 shares for $200ish and sell covered puts if the liquidity is there

I was on an intense backpacking hike with no signal and my legs were starting to fail. Tested the satellite thing and confirmed i could emergency sos if I needed to which gave me the motivation to keep going so didn’t end up needing it; You’re right, Apple probably should have considered your points before acquiring a 20% stake 2 months ago; Hey regard, OP's cost average is higher than SP last year. The fact you are this clueless makes me feel bullish ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)

I don't know man, who TF can tell the future, all quantum/nuclear stocks traded at penny level just last month ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271).  ASTS traded mid-30s couple months ago.

To me the chance this stock goes back to pre-Apple's deal (which was officially announced last month) is small, so why not?; lol being able to send a text message to anyone, even in the most remote of places is very helpful. 

i’ve used it several times; The bot knows; Say you have no idea what you're talking about without saying it.

🤡; Name me one stock that has gone through a reverse split and been successful afterward.; >move against algorithmic trading

What do you mean?; Do people really hit turtles?; VisualMod is absolutely locked-in this evening I see; Geezus you’re green; 👍🙌Also…New Globalstar CEO Paul Jacob’s (former CEO of Qualcomm) and many of his people followed him to Globalstar!; Is it worth an investment atp. I feel Iike if I put money in now I’m just going to watch it slowly drop. What’s your price target?; Apple bought it for its iWatch on text messaging, apparently, in remote areas.

What else can Apple use?  iPhone can be used in remote areas in that case as well as iPads.

Will we get Apple XM like Sirius XM?  Is Apple moving towards Spotify's business model which makes Sirius XM a candidate for takeover?  

EVs are something that Apple hesitated to commit.; Outside of texts right now what else will they be offering in the future?; *This “pivot.” Is it in the room with us now?*

Starlink is just wayyyyy ahead; and u dont think trump becoming president will help musk in getting approval? not trying to be political.. but u are even saying that starlink can get arround with the current tech and provide a service to the military. u see ukraine contracts going to starlink, airlines adopting starlink, remote houses adopting starlink, and not just usa. tmobile parterning with starlink

having aapl on your side is good, but aapl is also well known for investing and partnering with small companies and then ditch them when a better alternative is available; 👍🙌Also…New Globalstar CEO Paul Jacob’s (former CEO of Qualcomm) and many of his people followed him to Globalstar!; I believe so; I don’t know why everyone is jumping on Jan 17th 2025. Its so short-dated that you’re playing with fire. 

If you buy the same option but for Jan 2026, then you have a whole year for the share price to go ballistic. In this case the premium is not even that much more. Options that are ITM have intrinsic value and a delta relatively close to 1, so even if its far out, should the share price goes ballistic, your options are worth a lot more too because they’re exercisable right away.; Thanks; So true. These regards think that companies like fucking Apple and Microsoft just toss billions into guesses.; It doesn't mean it's a good investment? They just want to bring the technology in-house.

They spent a few hundred mill on a stake in the company when they are worth $3T 

This lets them have a say in what the company does and how they operate.; The bot knows fuck all; Reverse splits understandably get a bad wrap because of how often they’re used to regain compliance with the $1 per share minimum. However, GSAT is already compliant without the reverse split and is most likely using it to reduce the number of shares outstanding - which would address its dilution problem, give it marketability to funds whose investments are limited to stocks over a certain dollar amount, and provide relief if it is being “shadow boxed” by algorithmic trading; Exactly. RS is a huge red flag even in this case. They are purposely holding the share price down to justify the reverse split. It wouldn’t be necessary if they simply stopped manipulating the share price and allowed it to go up after the Apple news like it should have. This would mean they would have to pay their shareholders which they do not intend to do. It’s shady as hell. They should, at a minimum, provide some details about the RS such as exactly when it’s going to occur and what the split rate will be. They have been very vague about this and it’s because they want people to think they may not reverse split. They are going to reverse split. It’s their way to screw shareholders. No I don’t need a lesson in how reverse splits work. They are a red flag all around in every situation. At a minimum it means the stock has been grossly mismanaged.; Recently Blacksky; Chesapeake Energy Corporation... now EXE; Roflmao you’re joking right? How about Tesla?; Most exchanges offer liquidity rebates to High frequency trading firms like Citadel, Two Sigma, Flow Traders, etc. for adding liquidity/market depth to order books (I.e. buying and selling shares). These rebates are typically based on the quantity of shares traded, so these firms will often target low value stocks and keep them range-bound by placing limits on both sides of the spread and farming the rebates.

You can see this in most stocks under $2-3 -  the candles are usually precise and robotic like the image

I have no tech background to know if it's legit.

Anyone knows ASTS tech can chime in? I missed ASTS and consider to jump in this stock. Apple is not a random company, the fact they bought stake in this company is good news. But they can also be wrong ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); If they make the move into quantum communication, they could effectively become a cybersecurity company; Well it can, you'll be -85 per contract tho. You need it to reach it 3.85 and only then you have x4 leverage over just buying share. Not worth the risk imo, i would rather buy shares likes op if i like the stock; lol what? “Communication” is not a business model; I think that Elon tends to overstep, and that Trump doesn’t like to be overshadowed. If at any point he feels that Elon is being credited more than him for anything, he may get him out of the spotlight ASAP.

However if the two powerhouses can coexist without bruised egos, then there is a chance that Musk and his companies do receive preferential treatment for sure. That’s a risk I’m willing to take at GSAT’s current valuation though; Not guaranteed though; They literally do. Look at Cisco; They spent a few hundred mill *in addition to* the $1.1B in cash they gave them. The fact that Apple even sees enough in their operations to want to have a say in what this company does is significant.; GSAT does texting only over satellite's where as ASTS does full 5G data speed over 20Mbpa and up to 120Mbps. Their not even comparable. 

GSATs 5G is not for their satellite business it's a different product.

ASTS makes GSAT obsolete in 18 months. The stocks down 40% of the recent run up. A great time to buy. $12B mktcap for a company analysts project to be doing $4.5B annual revenue this decade (and that's a very low estimate); I read that also. Theoretical quantum communication pivot aside, the business is already fundamentally sound and growing as is.; Good luck if you invest based on if they make the move.; Yeah ok there’s no communication companies - thanks

They haven’t done shit in 35 years and todays not the day that changes; Starlink is a different business model, we aren’t in competition, and Elon won’t get anywhere trying to step on regulators just because he’s  buddies with DJT (for now); It's not guaranteed? No fucking shit; Cisco is huge though; You’re forgetting how much cash Apple has; It's just a footnote that they can use to sell iPhones and make commercials about and keeping it from Androids

""Look how cool the new iPhone is, it has this worthless feature you'll never use""

That's literally the purpose. It's garbage; Why do you keep just using the word quantum in relation to this company? ; *This “pivot.” Is it in the room with us now?*

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*; I’m not. I’m investing based on everything I wrote above.; I’m not forgetting, it’s a supporting factor in my investment decision; Apple has been GSAT’s largest customer since September of 2022 - we’ve already been using the features they provide. Their original agreement allotted 85% of their network capacity to Apple exclusively.

If Apple thinks the service they provide is worth taking a reportable stake to protect, then the service provided must be valuable. Apple not only took a large enough stake to become a minority interest, but handed them $1.1B unrelated to the equity transaction so they can scale. 

This most recent agreement guarantees revenue while allowing them to pay down debt and focus on growth.; Because the original question was about what new service I see them offering in the future.; Well part of your argument hinges on the fact that them investing in 20 percent is significant. But to Apple that 20 percent is largely insignificant when compared to their cash pile. Honestly the 20 percent investment is lends more credence to the idea that they bought the stake to make sure the technology stays in house not that the stock is going to rocket up; Nah it's a relatively cheap marketing ploy for apple 

They don't offer a useful service and no one cares about it, sorry to burst your bubble

But put your money in this trash and let me know how it works out for ya champ; The Apple stake is significant to me because GSAT is a 4b market cap company that is now backed by the reputation and credit of the single largest Tech company on the planet. I’m not interested in the percentage invested relative to Apple’s cash balance. I only care that GSAT will now have $1.1B more than it did before, and that it will be used to provide a service that Apple deemed so necessary that they took a minority interest in the company itself to protect it. 

It also tells me that Apple’s interests are now (financially and operationally) aligned with GSAT’s, and that they are willing to finance GSAT to protect those interests. Not buying the company outright indicates that Apple *needs* GSAT to continue operating as its own company, because they don’t know how to manage or run a satellite telecommunications company themselves. 

Apple now relies on this service that is important to its own operations, but can’t provide for itself. It’s not the exact $ amount of the stake that matters, but the implication that this 4b market cap company holds leverage over Apple’s operations in some way.; A cheap marketing ploy relative to the amount of funding they provided in this agreement would have been buying out every 30 second Super-bowl ad slot for the next 2 years ($840m). 

Your logic isn’t tracking; Haters dont see the whole picture here

Apple has long hated the ugly black mark on their otherwise glistening customer experience of having to depend on MNOs/carriers

If I was Apple, I’d have thought long and hard about what it would take to bypass carriers without needing to build cell towers, and if I had a decent idea, I’d be slowly implementing it on a global scale in a quiet way 

Find My network recruits operationalizes strangers’ Apple devices as nodes in a mesh network

N53/XCOM RAN/Sat connectivity and probably some patents and tech that Apple owns could probably enable a basic connectivity, sans ATT/verizon etc, that comes baked in to hardware for people who are mostly on WiFi anyway and sometimes need to text someone or access maps while driving

If such connectivity sells just 5% more iPhones, you’ve now expanded market share, made some billions and locked up a new crop of Apple hardware/software/services customers 

People don’t want to pay for satellite/mobile service on its own, but they definitely want to get it for “FREE” with purchased of a new iPad mini; I won’t say it’s impossible but I don’t think you’ll see drastic upward price movement. I could be wrong so we’ll have to wait and see. Good luck

Also the market doesn’t always respond in the way you think. I prefer companies like RKLB and PL with good foundation and management. And both have  strong paths towards profitability and are slightly pushed forward by some hype and products that are targeted and competitive. 

The docu wild wild space is pretty interesting and covers topics relevant to GSAT as well; GSAT makes a product that's worthless to everyone

We can agree on that, yes? Cool 

Apple buys it up and uses it for exclusivity in their phones cause their customers are morons

""iPhone means safety and security and peace of mind no matter where you are in the world"" - some bullshit like that.

That's how apple has to differentiate their overpriced trash from android now. 

Luckily their customers are idiots and lap it up. 

Glad I could explain it to you. GSAT is a worthless company with a product no one wants or cares about.

Go dump your money into it though, enjoy the 'gains'"
24,Riding the AI Wave for all of 2025,"Disclaimer: Novice investor here.



65/M a couple years from retirement. Besides some investment accounts that are diversified appropriately for my age and situation, I've got an IRA with $150K that I want to roll the dice with. I was going to configure this IRA with a 100% S&P 500 index fund, but now I'm thinking of doing something different.



Instead I want to take the entire $150K IRA and split it up evenly between these 7 stocks:

Alphabet

Amazon

Apple

Microsoft

NVIDIA

Broadcom

Palantir



My plan is to keep this portfolio for all of 2025. Then in January 2026 I'll diversify it appropriately.



This AI Wave is riding high right now, and I think it has the potential to go even higher before it starts to crest, which presents an opportunity to take advantage of that really doesn't come around too often.



If this 7-stock portfolio can beat the S&P 500 for 2025, I'll be happy. I think it has a good chance of doing so.



Critique this 7-stock portfolio please.

",https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1hno9pv/riding_the_ai_wave_for_all_of_2025/,28,2024-12-27 21:36:09,"Whats the point? These are pretty much the top holdings in any 401k or etf.; BBAI; Your portfolio is already an index fund ; That troll was an AI 🤖; You might see the most profits with PLTR. 

Im all in PLTR, sold the rest of my mag 7 

Good idea maybe not, no risk no reward.; I got Apple from stock-split at 119.5 for 100 shares in Oct, 2020. Google from stock-split at 138 for 220 shares after Aug. 2022. I should have got in when their price drop below my buy price. I did have TSM at 118 for 400 shares.

I am collecting NVDA shares one by one bw 130-150 for 10. I am not sure if I can get more before it hits 200. I wonder whether I should have saved my money in lump sum to buy NVDA just like I did with AAPL, GOOG, TSM instead of one by one. I missed last two stock split with NVDA without cash in hand.

I am not sure how these performance compared with SP 500 from 2020 to now.

This is my result from these stocks. It should run the same or better in coming years.; Replace NVDA with RKLB.  NVDA is dead money for 2 years.; As I said in another post, I would do 75-80% in MAGS, 10-12.5% in PLTR, 10-12.5% in AVGO.. I would also DCA into these positions. If you purchase all of your shares at once then you’re at risk of buying right before the price drops. I would spend like 25% of the money every 2 weeks so that you’re fully invested after 2 months. If the price drops from the current levels you will benefit from it. If the price goes up then you’re not missing out on the gains waiting for the price to drop; As others have pointed out, most of the stocks are going to be in the funds that you already hold. Palantir is a good one but has been on an insane tear

if you like AI, think about a quantum Stock like IONQ.

if you want to roll dice, look into a mag 7 dividend fund like YMAG

if you want to play individual stocks for fun, look into wheeling or covered calls on those stocks

this is not advice because I’m not a professional. I’m just a stranger on the Internet.

Good luck and have fun!; Smart money has been exiting these names. I like the strategy but not the companies.; SOUN 

quantum computing is taking off too check that sector out; I would swap out NVIDIA with TSM.

Why?  Market share.  TSM produces most of the world’s microchips and by a large margin.

For geopolitical reasons I feel it is undervalued and with the necessity of high end microchips in AI development I think it has a lot of potential for growth.

It’s up almost 100% over the past year and it has a good chance of going up another.

Anyways, give it a look, I’ve had it for two years with no plans on selling anytime soon.; You prolly want to diversify amongst micro-caps vs. major caps- and one ☝️ very effective element of seeking alpha is size (volume) and price- per share.
50% move on a  $6000 worth of stock will be dependent on QTY of shares, if you have 12 NFLX, its not getting the sparks you would for investing the same $6 k on  $3 stock that does 50% (2000  x 1.50) , additionally a stock that takes off from 1-3$ will double and triple more quickly if it catches momentum. I like to put 30% into small stocks that have the potential of being bought, breakthrough, or undiscovered.  See MYO for last 18 months.
See CELH for 5 year chart. 
I especially love Biotechs that have a 5 or 10 year chart from $100 to under $5 , because with any good news they will retrace to 25-50% quickly. 
See MGNX.; We’re in the second inning of the 9 inning AI takeover. We’ve only just begun; also some penny stocks like IonQ and RGTI; Why not simply buy $VOO?; Don't double down on what everyone has already doubled down on 7 times.

Eventually, the price has to come back down to meet value.

You have recency bias because of how stocks have been behaving. This is not the norm. Expecting it to be the new norm is foolish.; It sounds like an exciting plan! Investing in these seven tech stocks could be promising given the current AI wave. However, be mindful of concentration risk and market volatility. Diversifying and regular rebalancing can help manage risk.

Best of luck with your portfolio in 2025!; If you must do one of these & want maximum returns, go balls put on PLTR. This is the way. That $150k has the potential to double or triple next year alone. But you may not have the balls for going “maximum returns”…respectfully of course; Why does OP write this like an LLM prompt; Anybody have insights into IONQ RGTI POET; Why does this reddit written like an llm prompt

Also where is GOOG; Boring.; True. But I want to focus on these 7 individual AI stocks for maximum returns.; Thanks, just read that BBAI has a positive forecast for 2025.; Sure, BBAI have good time in 2025; Right, I realized that after I posted. There are a few MAG7 Index funds out there. But they don't include Broadcom and Palantir.

So maybe what I should do is go with the following:
33% MAG7 Index fund
33% Broadcom
34% Palantir; What would your AI centered portfolio for 2025 look like?; IonQ Is $45.  It should also fall because they don't make money yet.  Also because I sold after it tripled and I thought it was already at an absurd price($25); He’s 65 years old and trying to retire.. the high potential of those companies also comes with high risk; I want to focus on just these 7 individual stocks for maximum returns.; Understood. Good points.



That said, even though the CAPE ratio for the MAG 7 is much too high, I've still heard a good many positive 2025 forecasts for the MAG 7 (valuations be damned), as well as for AVGO and PLTR. 



Maybe I should scale back and try something else. Being that this IRA already has the $150K at 100% in an S&P 500 index fund, and at a minimum I was going to leave it that way, I could do a variation on that:



$100K - S&P 500 index fund

$25K - AVGO

$25K - PLTR



That way I'll still get the MAG 7, as well as AVGO and PLTR.



Or, I could be even more aggressive and do this:



$50K - S&P 500 index fund

$50K - AVGO

$50K - PLTR





Would this be a little more realistic?; I bought both Ionq and POET a few months ago. I am VERY VERY happy with both stocks. Watch Soundhound as well!!; GOOG is there. First one on the list:
Alphabet; I would check out not yet expanded AI plays. RaaS is going to be the next step, plus tailored AI solutions.  SaaS is also going to connect the cloud and data to AI, so check out what will be the infrastructure to current AI plays that went hot the past few years.

The speculation on these is what is driving the quantum names through the roof right now, you got to be a step ahead of it if you want to see some numbers, especially for a sit and hold for a year play.

I just think those names are good, but worn out at this point. Also check out the ipo market. For 150k you can get into cerebras (or onlyfans if they go public) cerebras might be able to compete with Nvidia, it would be a score if it works, but it's also a gamble...; No. MAG7 should have a bigger weight. If those are the companies you want then I would invest 75-80% in MAGS, 10-12.5% in PLTR, 10-12.5% AVGO… this would give you a near equal weighting in every company; Ignore AI providers and look at software companies that quickly pick up clients while showcasing AI use cases in their company blog posts. Avoid anyone talking about genAI.

Look at existing mid cap software companies that are pivoting into AI offerings.

AI will be similar to the dotcom boom and there will be long term winners. The question is figuring out who’s actually implementing it, selling it well, and staying efficient as a business. Pick hardware or cloud AI providers for value stocks or software providers for growth stocks.

Additionally, watch for efficient mid/large cap companies that are acquiring AI companies in similar sectors, as these guys will squeeze extra cash out of these novel offerings.

Avoid AI ETFs and index funds or anything that will get on the general industry and instead bet on specific winners.

There will be some exceptions to these guidelines, but imo this is the way to capitalize on this new technology. Treat it like a potential way to make software and business more efficient, not a new industry. Whoever does that the best will be the big winners. It could be any company from healthcare to trucking/logisitics, but it’s all about improvements to business efficiency.; yea you are right ☹️; PLTR has a forward P/E of 172 

Good is 20 or less.

Bad is 30 or more

I don't care if you like the company or think it's the most amazing thing on the planet. Let's say that's true

You're buying $1 of **expected** future earnings for $172.

There are just better places to put your money. It's silly.

If you're new, you have zero context for normal or a downturn or a crash.

These things happen. These things aren't rare.

The best places for $ right now are TLT, KMLM, soft commodities like CORN, SOYB.

Or in your bank waiting to be used when the market corrects or completely shits its pants.; Thanks for the info.; You have any in particular u like?; Thanks for breaking it down; that gives me a clearer picture of what an ABSURDLY high forward P/E really means.



Do you know where online I can check a stock's forward P/E? I'd like to take a look at some of the MAG 7 and \*maybe\* go with one or two of those instead of PLTR.



So you're recommending a Bond ETF like TLT, a Futures ETF like KMLM, or Commodities like CORN and SOYB? For what purpose? To preserve capital for when the inevitable market correction comes, and then buy the dip in the S&P 500?; For your situation, I would not invest in quantum.. they have seen insane run ups over the last couple weeks and at these companies are nowhere near profitability.

With your situation, you want to maximize the upside but limit the downside and the quantum plays aren’t going to do that.

The focus should be on high market cap companies that are well established. If I were you, I would only invest in companies with 100b+ market cap; Have you considered modular nuclear energy powering AI and quantum? 

That will be another part of this whole revolution I believe.; Tem, rxrx, cour and path for raw AI plays. Intc and cerebras when they ipo for chips. Optt, ktos drs onds for drone and robotics.  Heavy spec plays on mbot and ekso, serious casino on these. 

There are a few more but that's what I can rattle off, baba to get some Chinese AI too.

Also, did you hear OF might IPO!? Tell me that won't make money!; You can literally usually just Google forward p/e for most stocks. It'll give you sources.

You should also look at the Buffet Indicator.

Stocks are in a *massive* overvalued state. 2 standard deviations off normal.

Can it continue? Sure.

Is that the best bet to make? Absolutely not. That's trading based on sentiment, not value. Sentiment turns on a dime. Price cannot deviate from value forever.

TLT: Bonds are at massive low prices. Like hugely oversold. They are safe haven asset. If the economy goes to shit or the market dumps, they spike. Bonds also move non-correlative to stocks a lot, so this is a way to diversify and hedge instead of putting more chips on a stock market bet.

That said, if the Fed raises or stops cutting rates, TLT will continue to fall.

Scenario 1 is more likely than scenario 2. 

Buying a stable asset at huge lows, hoping for a move up, is less risky than buying things that are overbought at all-time highs, hoping they'll go higher.

KMLM is non correlated to the stock market, so it's a useful hedge. If you already have a bunch of money in the general stock market, you don't want to just keep putting money into the general stock market. 

Soft commodities do well in recessions compared to a lot of other things. It's the same idea as a JNJ PG, consumer staples type trade. Broke people still buy toilet paper, toothpaste and bread. 

Bear in mind, soft commodities are subject to a lot of price volatility because of crop yields, oil prices, etc.

Commodities are, again, a way for you to stop dumping all your money into one kind of asset in 10 different ways.

There a lot of ETFs and funds that are way overweighted in overvalued tech. I'm sure you have a lot of them in your portfolio. You're loaded for bear with risk.

Don't dump more money into the same stocks, the same sector, etc.

You're 65. You need to hedge and take fewer risks. I know things look good now but, and this is just a thought experiment - how would things look if all your stocks dumped 40%?

If you're still totally comfortable with how that looks, then invest all you want in a sentiment, market euphoria trade. 

It's just not the best play, in my opinion.

And yes, the idea is that TLT KMLM go up as stocks decline, and then you use those profits to buy stock or VOO when prices aren't comically high.; >Is that the best bet to make? Absolutely not. That's trading based on sentiment, not value. Sentiment turns on a dime. Price cannot deviate from value forever.

Excellent way to put it. Great advice.

I've got another IRA that's diversified appropriately, which I don't have to touch right now. And I have two years of expenses in T-Bills. And I'll start taking SS at FRA, two years from now. So the way I look at it, if I went through with this now, and my stocks dumped 40%, I've got at least two years to ride it out and wait for a recovery.



Like I said as a novice investor the purpose of my post was to hear back from experienced investors. I totally appreciate your feedback, you definitely know what you're talking about, and it will factor on whether I go through with this or not. At the very least you've clearly shown me that this would be even more of a long shot and riskier than I initially thought.; All good. I'm glad I'm being of some use.

Two years **is not** a long period of time for a recovery.

Again, recency bias makes you believe that. You don't have broader context.

We've had this insane bull run. In 5 years, the S&P has gone up 151.8%. The average return for 5 years should be 35%-50%

1 year shows a 28% gain. Average should be 7%-10%.

We've had 3x the regular amount of growth we should, and people think that's normal because why wouldn't they? They've only seen this window of the market

But all that growth came from literal free money being given out all over the world and banking rates dropping to zero around the world. Corporate buybacks artificially bloating stock prices. Everyone in the world suddenly becoming a stock experts, trading millions on their phones while they're on the toilet.

What got us here doesn't exist in the economy any more. A correction is **long** overdue. If price to earnings is 40x or 172x earnings have to come up or price has to go down. Earnings aren't going to come up fast enough.

But the general advice you'll get from uneducated investors will be ""buy and hold"" ""dollar cost average down"" ""stocks always go up"".

These things are thoughtless clichés parotted over and over. They were introduced by investment companies and banks as strategies to keep people invested.

As a friend who works for Fidelity says, ""The stock market goes up because it has to go up. If it doesn't, the whole economy blows up.""

They need people invested, or they don't make their commissions, expense ratios, consulting fees, etc.

The truth is that stocks do go up. And if you had always invested the same amount every week for the whole time the stock market has been around, you would be massively wealthy. 

But you'd be dead.

The other truth is, there have been frequent, long periods of time where stocks dropped and didn't recover for decades. Of went flat after a drop.

We're talking periods of 10, 15, 30+ years.

I've gone through the S&P in other posts to cite these specific times. There are lots.

I'm not saying that **will** happen, but it **can** and **does** happen.

I'm helping my parents navigate their retirement now, so the dollars and cents of it are all very real when you sit down and plan it out. You have to be realistic.

Your money is locked up in stocks/T-bills (you'd have to look up each fund to see what stocks it has), and you're looking at retiring.

Your goal shouldn't be taking on more risk. It should be security and a good, stable return.

It's not sexy, fun stuff but neither is trying to pay hospital bills when you have no money when you're 80.

So: 

If you put that $150K into a 4% savings account, then by the time you're 75, it'll be $225K. Zero risk.

If you put it into the stock market and you get a normal return of 7%-10%, you'll have $290K - $395K

If you put it into the market and the market drops 20% and then doesn't go up, you have $120K in 10 years (and your other stocks will drop too, obviously)

If you invest in stocks that are overvalued and the market drops, your $150K becomes $75K pretty quick.

I can't tell you what is right for you. Just make sure that you're fully aware of all the scenarios, including the absolute worst."
25,Advice,"Advice needed. I'm an inexperienced stock trader. During the COVID-19 crash in 2020, I bought $15,000 worth of random stocks: Boeing, Delta, Spirit Airlines, Spirit AeroSystems, MGM, Disney, Apple, and JetBlue, as recommended by my coworkers at the firehouse dinner table. Spirit Airlines has filed for bankruptcy, so I hold worthless shares.
 
I also sold some stocks this year with an $8,000 profit:
Delta - 160 shares at $50 for a +97% return & Apple - 4 shares at $228 for a +72% return.
 
What should I do with the remaining stocks, hold or sell?
 
Disney - 2 shares @ $86.45: Currently +29% 
JetBlue - 55 shares @ $5.40: Currently +44% 
Spirit Airlines - 949 shares @ $6.06: Currently -94% 
MGM - 35 shares @ $12.24: Currently +185% 
Spirit AeroSystems - 100 shares @ $20: Currently +69% 
Boeing - 35 shares @ $142: Currently +26% 
 
 
The remaining stocks are currently showing -12%. I know Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems have some potential. I'm considering selling my Spirit stocks this year to offset my long-term capital gains. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you!

29,How do you assess if you’ve missed a stocks run?,"Amateur investor here, seeking to learn.

Much to my regret I’ve stayed away from Apple, Nvidia, Tesla etc over the past few years thinking they must be at the end of their run and future growth has been priced in to the stock price based on the p/e. In that time I’ve still done well enough on more conservative stock choices but I’m left with FOMO for the crazy gains I could have had.

Even now when I look at Nvidia I wonder if there’s still room to go up. I look at Apple and think they’ve not released much innovation of note lately (I use a lot of their products) and Tesla seems to be way overpriced compared to other car manufacturers (and Elon looks to be playing with fire)

Am I thinking about this all wrong?",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hncoei/how_do_you_assess_if_youve_missed_a_stocks_run/,114,2024-12-27 12:08:08,"In this case, it's more about your emotion than the valuation. I would argue that if you thought they were at the end of their runs few years, you would probably sell quickly before. The difficult part is to manage your emotions. 

You decided it was too risky and too overvalued at that time, stick to it and find other opportunites. They are not the only companies in the world.; For me, a very important thing is having a strong thesis and one where I can sort of build out a realistic ""story arc"" in my mind.  I really do try to actively look for things early - both individual names but also broader themes. It's easier to be long-term about something and let it play out when you were early and your cost basis is low. I do think that the people late to an investment party are often the first ones out the moment things get a little volatile. The people who have a cost basis 50% lower and who have been holding for a year are not thrilled but less easily shaken out than the person who FOMO'd in and now is seeing the position in the red every time they look. As someone else noted in the comments, emotions are a big part of investing and it's important to do whatever you can to manage them (low cost basis, understanding your risk tolerance, appropriate allocation, etc)

I also do focus on things that I think that are likely more ""built to last."" An example of this was buying nuclear power plant stocks late last year/early this year on AI power demand, which played out better than I'd expected for what I thought was a relatively low-key way to play AI demand. 

 If I'm buying something that's done well there has to be some thought as to what can still play out (are there aspects to the story that can branch out?), what's underappreciated, etc. I think today ""sheer demand""/flows is an element that can take a popular story higher than expected but that isn't ultimately sustainable and eventually things become overcrowded - you get that long ""(fill in the blank popular stock) only goes up"" escalator up, people get complacent, FOMO and then when something gets wildly overcrowded you get the eventual elevator down. 

For a bigger theme, optimally I'd like to have a satisfying allocation to it, do well then eventually lessen. If after I lessen it's very clear that there's some more to go, I may re-up a little bit on dips but not likely take it back up to the allocation it was. There are times when I'll just remove a theme entirely that's a sizable allocation because I feel it's largely played out and something is more interesting. 

I have to be interested in the business, as well or else it just gets eventually bumped for more 
of something else where I am interested. There are times when there's a good story but one that gets wildly ahead of itself. I thought CAVA was kind of interesting and traded it early on - did not expect to see it do what it did. I look at that and go, ""I'm not *that* interested"" in the core story. CAVA is CAVA and people like the restaurants but it's a singular restaurant chain (unless they buy something else) it's not a larger/broader theme or something where you can realistically see multiple use cases branching off. The ""story arc"" is not a bad story but it's also not very expansive.

At what point does the valuation per restaurant get absurd? It can get a lot more absurd than one would think but I look at that and worry that it's an escalator up/eventual elevator down and the people who bought at some ludicrous valuation (I think it was around $50M per restaurant at one point recently; Chipotle is around half that - CAVA's per restaurant valuation is ""unprecedented"" - https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZoh5asXIA8UPTu?format=png&name=medium) might have a long wait as bagholders if that isn't sustainable and people eventually pile out. Talking about a ""story arc"" - that feels like it skipped ahead several chapters and will eventually have to go back and read them over again. 

And there are things that I miss that were ultimately more sustainable stories than I thought. Sometimes I was simply wrong and what's the takeaway? 

Sometimes people over-extrapolate potential negatives to a story. I think that's perhaps going on to some degree with UBER currently. I do have some concerns with the longer-term and I don't think the company has presented an entirely clear vision of its place in transportation 5-10 years from now but Google announces a new city for Waymo and people sell Uber as if what *may* be 5 years from now is 5 months from now. The AV cloud will probably continue to sit over Uber until they convince investors otherwise but the selling from that will (and probably has) get overdone, at least in the short-term.

I do think that this is a market now more than ever where people pile into winners to a degree not seen before and anything that stops winning is dumped and dumped some more. Eventually, the level of pile on for some things and dumping others becomes a bit extreme and imo feels like we're getting there with some things if not there already. 

It does feel as if people need to expand their investment universe. Seems like if people don't want to invest in the popular things they act like there's nothing to invest in. Sooooo many people all with the same playbook - it works until it doesn't, you have to be flexible and have other ideas in mind beyond the same couple of dozen things that have been the most discussed for a while now. 

""the end of their run and future growth has been priced in to the stock price based on the p/e.""

Don't look at things entirely through the lens of p/e. I'm not saying that valuation is not important - I think it is ultimately important where you buy something and we get into these growth stock periods where people go ""valuation doesn't matter"" - it doesn't matter until it does all the sudden (see 2022) but if you over time view things with the singular focus of ""I don't want to buy something below some randomly chosen low p/e"" you're going to miss out on a lot of growth. There were a lot of people on here who wanted to short Nvidia at $200 in 2023 and then it went on to have one extraordinary quarter after another.; Some wise man once said - it's better to buy a great company at a fair price than to buy a piece of shit company at a cheap price, (or something like that); I’m going to continue to buy the Mag 7 whenever I get a chance. 

The way I do it is in smaller amounts trying to accumulate as many shares as I can throughout the year.  

If you dump a large sum into one of them at one time , I can see the worry about what price you got it at etc.  even though this is sometimes the best move , if your still on the sidelines waiting for valuation , just buy smaller amounts and keep adding to it; Teslas valuation is not tied to the business. It is because Elon bought a president.; I do think it is key to recognize future growth potential & upcoming catalysts, which play a fundamental role in whether you've 'missed the boat' or you can still make big gains.; If u lose money, FOMO will be fixed naturally. Missing stocks out is no problem. Losing principal is big problem.; Nvda is still good buy; I missed tons of it I  find good stock on cheap hold it for long they don’t move up for 2-3 years I sell they go up like crazy; Life is always about moving forward. what has happened doesn’t change and you just need to learn from your own mistakes. 

2 tips. 

1. calculate the value of the FOMO. how much do you actually miss? most people don’t even realize they are talking about $1k, $10k, or $50k. few poeple is taking about $100k FOMO. 

in my take, neither of those numbers change any one’s life, so FOMO is generally unecessary. not every one can pick nvda pltr at the right moment. so forget about it.

2. what is your judgement going forward? is market going 10% up for the next year? if so, invest today. near term 2% drop is less than 10%. 

JUST DO IT is the best way in the market. 80% chance you are getting an up year..; Stop looking at what you missed and look at whats coming.; Things Tesla has that other car makers don't. Energy storage, ev charging stations, AI division, robot division, self driving ""robo taxis"", the best engineers, they hire less than 1% of the applicants that apply, they build cars 1/3 the time of the closest competition, they don't just assemble cars, they build most the components in house(glass,seats,chips),lithium refining opening up in Corpus Christi Texas, over the air software updates, 20+ billion in cash, very little debt.....; Let me know when you figure it out; Your assessment is pretty good, and your concerns justified.  You should expand your list of stocks to look at to include ones with higher upside potential, like 20x rather than the very top of the market.  I agree with one of the commenters about needing a story arc.  Munger would call these mental models.  I really like RDDT itself as an example.  Social media, just shifting into profit with great growth, it could be a $1200 stock in a few years for a 12x gain.  Look for those, the biggest ones will either grow slowly or correct.; When you make an investment decision, you should have a thesis. That thesis should be - I think stock X is undervalued because \*reasons\* (alternatively, stock X is overvalued because \*reasons\*). 

When your thesis no longer makes sense you should enact your exit strategy. I was very familiar with PLTR, and felt that it was undervalued at $16, so bought in. By the time it hit $65 I decided to exit. My thesis was no longer defendable. I have since missed out on an additional 25% gain. But as they say, no one ever went broke from taking profits. 

The inverse is that I continue to hold NVDA as my thesis is still viable. I'm still up as I've been holding for some time, but the recent depression in price has eaten into those gains. Same goes for MSTF - bought in in 2019 - with a thesis predicated on Azure growth. I still feel that there is value to be had, although, expectedly growth has slowed. 

TL;DR - you shouldnt be chasing the 'run', sure you can hit big, but you can also lose your shirt. Focus on fundamentals.; There is no reliable way to tell. In the 2000s Nasdaq PE ratio peaked above 200. Before the late nineties for the S&P PE of 20 was a practically impenetrable resistance. Post 2000s the median PE of the S&P permanently increased and now PE of 20 is closer to a support and rarely dips below it. Probably due to the first great democratisation of investing from internet brokerages. People make a lot of noise about the PE currently above or approaching the previously established ceiling but there is no guarantee that there isnt going to be a second democratisation of investing through min fee apps. Anyone who claims they can tell you exactly when a bull run will end well in advance is full of shit. Even the best traders who are highly attuned to indicators would probably only be able to tell on the day itself.; P/e is an awful metric for growth stocks. It’s trailing, and you really want forward looking p/e instead. Analyst estimates and targets can also be helpful for growth stocks. In the end, guessing the future is very hard.; Instead of FOMO ""coulda, shoulda, woulda"" you should do a DD and evaluate business potential. Otherwise you're just gambling.; Tesla was"" overvalued"" every year it's been in the stock market. People have always said I missed the run-up. You can't value Tesla like a car maker for several reasons. If you don't know those reasons then you haven't done enough research to invest in them. You own and use apple products everyday, yet you don't know about their valuation? They will make money off you and your data for the next 50 years bc apple lovers refuse to ever switch. Apples brand loyalty has its owners locked up. Apple owns its own appstore and every app in its store pays 15-30% just to be on its shelves... Apple has 200 billion in cash waiting for an opportunity to make a new product.; Nvidia is still dirt cheap. There I said it.; Everybody has a crystal ball, but only some of them are working, and you only know in hindsight. 

The idea of fundamental analysis is out of the window for the big hitters. Sentiment trading of bills rules. Eventually, there will be a correction, but nobody knows when and how much.

So what helps? Either you get an edge in understanding a business the way the rest cannot, you trust the magic of the index dca or you rely on your guts. DCF won't get you far with NVDA or TSLA.; just buy bitcoin it's on sale right now!; Buy stocks that are reasonably valued and be patient. Nobody can predict how long multiples will expand, so don’t even try. Avoid overvalued stocks like AAPL and TSLA. Simple as that.; I can see apple becoming the first $10T company so therefor I'm in, also their new AirPods are crazy good; everytime i buy i set target price. smths when i miss bull run and see that my target price is very close, i usually dont even invest. biggest bull run this year for me was alaska airlines where i missed round 50 percent gains, my portfolio this year is 5 percent down. it was -30 last week btw, i had great week no lie, but still need 5 percent to even out. obv lost time, but got exp as well; Every stock price represents an average opinion of what the company is going to earn in profits in the near future.  If you're a stock picker you have to decide which stocks you think are underestimated by the average opinion. There are bull and bear cases for every stock. Even stocks that are grossly overvalued on paper could be underestimated by the market and continue returning more than what investors expect. That's why very few people consistently beat the market average. Your guess is as good as anyone's.; FOMO 

There is always another trade, another company, another play.

Trying to capture a move up when a stock is at or near all time highs gives you less EV than looking for a better opportunity.; Check out ASTS, it’s in my opinion a very solid choice if you don’t mind waiting a few years potentially.; If it’s running, you’ve missed it.; You won’t participate it the 30 to 50 percent decline, so stay out til then; Your issue was that you tried to value these stocks but it’s difficult to do and even if you were spot on it’s about sentiment a stock can remain over valued for years if the big boys like it then valuation goes out the window they will keep it prompt up; Ditto OP. I’m in the same swamp, lacking the aptitude to do any fundamental or technical analysis. Core positions like Mag 7 and other large cap growth stocks and etfs are holds, come hell or high water. The smaller allocations I chip away at, taking profits if there are profits a little at a time. I don’t keep the losers for a very long time, although that has bitten me in the ass a few times as a couple rose after I dumped them.; I watched QSI go up 69% yesterday, now it’s up another 69% today. It’s insane. I sat on my hands, no FOMO for me.

That’s just on shares. I made 65% and 77% return on two sets of call contracts I had this month. To make those gains on just shares in short time…unreal.; My portfolio nvda, brk, avgo and msft.
got in early on nvda and late on the rest. Plan to ride the tide for the next 5 years, then I retire and then rethink income stocks. Is that viable?; There are other fish in the sea.; name me a time that Tesla didn't look over priced lol......many a hedge fund has gone belly up trying to predict Tesla was over priced.; Tesla has an edge when it comes to costs. I think they have a significant fire risk and I could see regulation in regards to their current models because any fire will need 100 gallons of water to put out. That is a huge problem and is a valid excuse to regulate them.; Where can you find a table of US stocks to easily compare them in one UI? By this I mean somewhere to rank the by stock price percentage change in for example daily change, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly,  three years etc.; RSI and VIX are great indicators of  a stock or market being overbought. P/E is a good indicator for long term investments; I DCA based on VIX. I buy sp500 everytime VIX hits over 20, ideally over 25.; We have a client that made 5 million of NVDA with a 9k investment! crazy, it took a while and lots of patience not to sell, but still. The next NVDA is already here and under a dollar. Good luck finding it!; Buy apple and nvida. Don’t buy tesla.; You just have to make an educated guess. How has the stock performed in previous years/months leading to this one? How is the overall market faring at the moment? What news or rumor is effecting its current price? How long has the price been falling or rising and is it showing signs of ‘slowed growth’ (AKA is it losing momentum and starting to move sideways)? All of these are things you should look at before buying; Before this crazy run up by apple, I bought in at 224, I saw the technicals and knew this was going to the moon.
The people in the trading platform community thought the same as you 
No innovation

Overvalued pos at 224

At this point stock is bloated against the fundamentals. 
What needs to be seen how much of favor can Musk win for himself and Tesla  before any of this happens; Well it has always been way elevated before Trump; This 100%!; I could’ve sworn it had something to do with democrats running the worst candidate of all time but whatever makes you feel better; Musk 2028; [removed]; Totally wrong. Tesla stock IS tied to the business: massive scale producing safe, reliable EVs, battery storage, and robots. Legacy autos/analysts are idiots who have doomed their companies.; So true. How do you handle it... I have had 2 recent misses myself in Coinbase and Carvana. Both have gone over 1000% since I sold them after holding them for 2 to 3 years.

You have my upvote.; So I should buy 12/29/25 $200 Nike calls?![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face); Tesla's revenue is generally coming from the cars themselves. You're arguing this justifies their insane evaluation because they have potential, even though Elon keeps over-promising. 

Being able to drive coast to coast with FSD was supposed to be a thing 7 years ago and still isn't close to becoming a reality.; Well said. Simmilar to a concept of a moat. I don't really think of Tesla as a car company alone... I think of it as another platform company that will revolutionize the world.

Please don't hate me for saying this, though. I am also not a big Musk fan.

You’re probably right.; Around the world incumbents on both sides of the isle lost their elections because of the inflation caused by Covid. The fact that Kamala lost by only 1% after starting such a late campaign isn't too bad.; Teslas are decently priced if you take into account the EV credit and the gas savings , I bought my Tesla in June 2024 and wud not have bought  if there was no EV credit available. Will he reduce the price to make up for the loss of EV credit is something we have to see.; Not sure if this is a serious question...but their valuation changed. Kind of a key component of any thesis.; Both those statements are false. They have gained market share in the EV space. They have also gained market share in the overall vehicle space.

Etc. worth looking in to.; Thank you!; So far It gives me results consistently. I believe myself more; Tech correction happened in 2022, and it looks the same to me this time. Individuals report tax around that too, so they need to cash out to pay tax.; Thnx , so I also invest ( dca ) in the normal vanguard and some sectoral index funds like SMH, should I also plan to buy the mag 7 along with some more risky stocks like AMD; I came here to discuss stocks not politics. 

But - I remember in the 80s and 90s when the Democrat party was synonymous with the working man and actually trying to help Americans. My mom voted for Bill Clinton. 

Now it's just a party of pro-abortion, and social identity programs, gender politics, race baiting bullshit and of course - pro sending money all over the world to pay for proxy wars and that hasn't done shit to help the working man in four+ years. 

I was certainly ready for a change.; Who's the CEO of Tesla?

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Going to be super exciting /s; So certain QC companies that do less than 20 mil yearly revenue now have 4.5 bil market caps. QC is truly this year’s meme trade.; Insert simpsons stop stop hes already dead meme; Tis nothing but a scratch.; yucky; Already had a small position but I'm adding to my Tesla short here. Chinese EVs eat Tesla's lunch internationally, they are rocking an absurd triple digit PE, and now he has alienated both sides of the political spectrum. All I need now is for trump to come out and slam Elon for wanting to increase H1Bs. Probably wishful thinking, but it would be an absolute homerun.

Plus it's just a nice hedge for a net long portfolio on rocky days like today.; Jeez Louis didn’t know Santa was bringing diddy with him 😞; I mentioned ARIS yesterday, and came across a podcast about waste water in the Permian, found [here](https://open.spotify.com/episode/11octITUh1HhRCdaKzQf8x?si=Js9Ekn9bSty1lpzEIxtTaA). 

The amount of water moved to facilitate fracking in the Permian is mind boggling. It has resulted in changing the elevation of the land land by +/-6"" in places, and the pressure with which it's injected is causing earthquakes and even geysers.; RIP to the guy that was asking about DCA vs Lump sum and lumped sum ytd; the swings these month have been bonkers; I DCA’d yesterday. My bad guys.; More like the Krampus Slump, amirite?; More than 14 million options expire on BTC today; Its crazy to me that only 35% of QQQ names are above their 50 day moving average but the index is just a hair below its all time high. Really shows just how lopsided this market is and is only 25% for the sp500; What's going on with TLT?

I have 8 stocks doing less than s&p500 but that one has been the worst so far; [Looks like S&P 600 (small caps) earnings growth](https://i.imgur.com/ti39qm4.jpeg) is finally turning positive. They were -19% and -7% realized for 2023/2024, and now 21% and 19% for the next two years. 

The same source (Yardeni) says the same figures for the S&P 500 are 14% and 14%, and for mid caps (S&P 400), 14% and 16%.  For context, forward P/Es are 22, 16, and 16 for large, mid, small in that order. So mids offer same earnings growth as large for 63% of the multiple. Smalls give you 1.5x higher earnings growth as mids for same multiple. And smalls give you 1.5x earnings growth for 63% of multiple of large.

[The steady rise in the S&P 600 forward P/E the last few years](https://i.imgur.com/96AuYYd.jpeg) was driven in part by earnings decline while price stayed mostly constant. Now earnings will start to kick in and suppress P/E.

Unlike the Russell 2K, to be included in the S&P 600, ""Companies must have positive as-reported earnings over the most recent quarter, as well as over the most recent four quarters (summed together)"".

I'd love to see the current stock price and my open p/l. Not terribly concerned about today's performance.; SPX reversal; VIX being tamed.; 5800 2025 then up from there late cycle coming up kids.; Good volume today.; [removed]; I’ll get yelled at for spamming by some, but unusual drop this morning. However it’s only allowed to sell for an hour or so and now we have begun the great V. Hope no one took the bait. Never can stay down and always on its way back up. I don’t see how anyone could panic. Like it has a chance of going lower after 10:30.; Anyone else believe we live in a false vacuum?; Just sold my first call on S&P-500 🥳. It's sort of ""covered"" because a lot of my ETFs are highly correlated to it.

Vix is benign at 15.50.. so got a cool one week's groceries worth premium, on 8% OTM, expiring in Jan.

Am I stupid? Will I starve in February?


What's considered a good ""income"" on 8% OTM, with a month long expiry? To me, it sounds like a good deal, because 8% upside in a month is bit too much, without any major event in sight.; I was already exhausted. This is going to be extremely detrimental to my mental health.; 2021 was crypto 

2022 was energy 

2023 was Muh AI 

2024 was some Muh AI and then now QC

I lump sum yesterday; I did at the start of today. . Also my fault. ; Where does one trade BTC options?; Adding to that, a lot of the 35% are bloated or overvalued companies like pltr, Tesla, etc; Shows how lopsided….and how it isn’t really just “a market.”   It’s Top 20.  And then hundreds of other companies that had an average to mediocre year; wall street bros say that is perfectly fine. The best companies make most of the money and are weighted the most; Bonds react negatively to inflation. Lowering rates cause inflation. The feds cut rates when they think the economy is doing bad. But that didn't really match the market in September, November and December. Upcoming administration tax cuts and tariffs should also increase inflation.


But a recession would cause tlt to increase in price as they're considered safe.


The sentiment of the market can change quickly. Bad this week. Good the next.


I do think a recession is coming but I thought that for a while lol. Market might recover.; Yeah, for real. The hell is happening?; What about Nana?; wats grandpa; Part of it might be the hostile reaction of the republican base to the H1B program.  Trump was previously much more amenable, but if he canceled the program, tech companies are going to lose a lot of talent.; It’s tax harvesting by the big boys after two 30% up years. No more reason needed than that.; Why strange? Valuations are too damn high. A stock like AAPL should have a P/E of 20 rather than 42.; Realistically, Jay Pow Wow slammed shut any hopes of passing by the JPM collar high end of 6055 and cemented that 6099 will be the top for SPX in 2024.

May have also cemented that SPX equal weight has put in an important high, but it's still too early to tell.; You mean Ukraine’s drones doing it; Bane of my existence; Failing to break ATH was hilarious to see; next year, that one is going to be 40% up, and the rest will languish at 10-15%; And yet IJR (the equivalent to the S&P 600 small caps) has been just as disappointing movement wise as the Russell 2000 since 2018 really, even with the more stringent requirements...

Let's be real, at this point, you can't count on anything positive from small caps as a group until the pundits give up on being bullish here and probably until after another political side of the spectrum gets to be disappointed on how small caps as a group move for them, for a decent period of time.; I’m a fan of the SP400 but the issue is that the companies are mostly midsize financials and industrials who don’t much margin power and suffer from high competition.; no joke. today is friday, and despite being a holiday week, my local mall parking lot was packed early afternoon. almost no spaces left.; Smoke screen for government corruption and deep state control. Also possible lizard people/alien invasion imminent.; It was a santra rally if you sold before big boy came.; How fair of you; Just my humble opinion, but the move post election was very disappointing outside of tech.


I wasn't around for the lead up to '17, being in my younger 20's then, but you saw the Russell 2000 and banks actually hold their gains well, and in this case, they threw most of their gains away in a few weeks after racking up solid gains.


I suppose this might actually show that the market remembers and is skeptical that Trump does anything special for the ""others"" outside of tech companies.; I have family running around trying to get people to buy in on Tesla, not for fundamental belief in the company but for fundamental belief in Musk. It's a meme stock, and it'll crash as a meme stock does. You can probably track action on the stock by how well people who have bought in feel about him; so right now he's having a fall out with MAGA rank-and-file over immigration. Those people will cash out, and I have a feeling that's a lot of people.; Predictive value doesn’t exist if there’s not a decent sample or consistent trend. Dec. 2010, 2014 and 2017 were good times to buy. Dec. 2007 and 2021 weren’t. All this potentially shows is that we can’t predict anything from a bad Santa rally.

But also, how are you defining “bad Santa Rally”? The market seems to have been doing ok lately from where I’m standing.; If I have my timing right on when the Santa Claus rally is supposed to occur, I think the fat lady is just getting prepared to warm up, not singing yet.

Thing with this is that I don't think it panned out preceding this year. If you can remember, 2024 actually started slowly, and that's what I think placed the ""Santa Claus rally period"" in the red.; Not a one of the expensive Precision laptops I unboxed this week would boot. They’re prioritizing profit over making working products so their stock will probably do very well. ; I think it will do fine.  It’s way off the highs so in that way it’s a bit price derisked.

When it comes to pcs and generic servers, if Microsoft goes through with their plans to pretend all existing computers are obsolete and force everyone to buy new hardware for windows 11 ram-through, Dell is a beneficiary.  

When it comes to data center buildouts, they are one of if not the top choice for architects and CTOs to rubber stamp since they have tried and true products, and especially, they have operations tools that are much better than everyone else.  Will CTOs want to green light big SMCI purchases when there’s still a lot of clouds over SMCI’s accounting and existence?  Or will they do the safe, job-protecting thing and just buy Dell?

Company wise they tend to have conservative guidance and stable leadership.  It’s not recommended to bet against Michael Dell.; It's a packaging company. What is exactly that they do? Buy components, assemble and sell? My teenage son does it too.; Remember they work for the Big Boys. Not us.; Yep, people are selling their winners and buying the dogs.; That's how u know it's not you, it's the market; Webull? That's what I use; Im okay w that as long as Jan 3rd is 5800 ;p; Sorry - the post you're trying to make mentions a stock that currently breaks rule #7.

Any of the following criteria is considered breaking the rule:


* Typically trades under $5 or previously traded under $5 within 6 months

* Below $300 million market cap or previously traded under 300m before the pump within 6 months

* Most OTC / PINK stocks

* Usually has missed reporting/filings; no auditing or odd auditing issues

* Low volume or wide bid/ask spread

* Doesn't have any big name institutional holders

 * If the biggest institutional holder is a stock promoter then they don't count as an institutional holder

* All SPACs

To a subreddit that literally only wants insanely bullish markets. Of course you're getting awful feedback lol this isn't the place and your method of going about it is just whiny and not useful. 

Market predictability is a good thing. Get off reddit and turn those words into results. Any day trader knows that almost every red day will V so maybe trade it instead of complaining.; Just happened player; Vacuum decay theory is occurring and we are bye bye soon; That's not even close to what covered calls are; You own the S&P fund you sold the call on right?; I'm waiting for it to run back to highs and double top.  Ill be taking a 6m Put position on it and sleeping REAL easy; It’s like “Yayyyy Santa’s here!!” We rally until we find out he brought diddy…no one wanted to be diddled on Christmas; Happened to me winter of '22. Was upside down for awhile even while adding to the position. Won't ever do it again even if it's statistically wrong. This summer I moved an old 401k and decided to dca the whole year. It's cost me but idc. I didn't want to top a new high and I really thought the market was frothy. Oh well in the long run it doesn't amount to much.; I'll never lump sum again regardless of where the market's at. I bought 23k worth of HSY for about 230 per share and we had a nice move up to 275, so I didn't buy the top. But now with the price down to 170 I really wish I would've DCA'd that.; you just caught a bad year:

Vanguard Study 2012:
Lump sum investing outperformed DCA about 66% of the time across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, and a 60/40 portfolio).
The study simulated data from the U.S., U.K., and Australia over 10-year periods, concluding that the earlier you invest, the more time the money has to grow.
Average outperformance: LSI yielded 1.95% higher returns than DCA over 12-month periods.

Morningstar study 2022:
Over a 10-year period, lump sum investing beat DCA 68% of the time.
However, DCA reduced downside risk by about 25% during bear markets, making it a more appealing option for risk-averse investors.; Thankfully you can now buy TOPT and just buy the top 20 in a neat etf; Without a doubt in mind a recession is coming but no one knows the timing. You can lose a lot of money trying to time it lol; Among other things, market not liking the move in rates.; The 10 year has spiked up these past 3 months, it's up 22%.

That means the smart money is betting inflation will go up under the new administration, or for whatever reason rotating into treasuries. This brings down market returns.; Bro, they harvest loss, not profits. I'm lucky to be resident of country that has no concept of capital gains tax. So help me understand this... 

You earn, pay tax, and hopefully save and invest this already taxed money. Then you hopefully get a bit of profit.. and that too is taxed? 🤯

So, what if I had bought AMZN 10 years ago, and made 10X? I'm now paying tax on my 9X profit, for something I held for 10 years? What about inflation over these 10 years (indexation benefit)?; Russel 2k is basically flat since 2018 accounting for inflation while the indices have doubled.

It was always clout chasing tech bros, and on some level it was always tied to Elon's personality. Environmentalists put emphasis on public transportation as a first order, and if they're buying electric vehicles, then it's one of the other models from Ford or Chevrolet that are cheaper.

Tesla's main conceit was that it was cool to have an electric car now because it looks like a sports car and not a Prius. Environmentalists don't care about sports cars, lol.

Tesla will always have a built in fan base of Elon Musk cultists. They'll keep buying his garbage cars and cybertrucks, even when they brick or run over someone on auto mode. But that's not going to be enough to sustain demand, especially when the company keeps missing delivery targets. And then having to troubleshoot their poor quality cars. Tesla's brand is Elon's personality, and when he starts alienating the people who like him for his personality and the dumb shit he says, then the stock will crash.; 2011 and 2015 Nasdaq was up 3% and 8%.

There was a big rally for most of 2018 and a big sell off at the end of the year followed by a quick recover at the start of 2019.

32,Thoughts on AST Space Mobil (ASTS),"I’ve been looking into this company. It has an interesting mission, and I want to like it, but I’m having a difficult time seeing a successful business plan.

To their credit (and the only reason why I’m considering them) they do have A LOT of contracts with major carriers. That said, the contracts don’t really appear to be worth all that much, especially considering the insane costs that comes with space missions. For instance, their contract with one of the largest carriers, Verizon, is only worth $100M, which will only fund the creation and launch of a few satellites. AST still needs to put 60+ satellites into orbit before they can even think of offering 24/7 satellite internet services. That’s not cheap. They have an insane amount of debt, and their contracts seem comparatively cheap (which might be the only reason they have all these telcos signing with them).

Combine that with the fact that Starlink is going to be their major competitor, and they have name recognition and actually already have enough satellites in orbit to actually offer D2C internet services. Starlink hasn’t been seriously trying to capture the cell phone market, but if they start putting an ounce of effort into it, I don’t see a reason why any telco will go with AST over Starlink.

I want to like this company, though. Am I missing anything?

Even then, their texting service is kinda shit at the moment (look up the restrictions for texting via starlink in New Zealand.)

Meanwhile, ASTS alpha tedting shows seamless voice and video communication, and the full constellation will be able to compete with 5G.

RE: funding, they've already covered the cost of the first 26 satellites. The plan isn't to be a standalone carrier, but rather to be an addon to existing carrier plans. The current sentiment is that the MNOs will simply include a fee on user's bills, and a portion of that fee will be paid to ASTS.

Just using conservative numbers...

In the US alone, Verizon and AT&T combine for ~260M subscribers. If they add a $2 / line charge to user's bills, that's $520M /mo. The carriers don't really have to do anything to gain this coverage, so we can assume 50% for ASTS. This works out to $260M per month / $3.12B per year of revenue.

Vodaphone has 330M subscribers. Plans are cheaper in EU and Africa, so let's cut the revenue by 75%. This is an additional $990M / year.

Between just these two, ASTS is looking at ~$4B / year in revenue.

ASTS is estimating a total cost of $1.8B to build out and launch their full constellation of 168 satellites. After that, maintenance on the ground is negligible. People are estimating ASTS will be over 80% profitable once they're in full service. This is earning of $3.2B per year.

Edit: adding on to this, ASTS current public float is 149,320,000. At earnings of $3.2B, that works out to an EPS of $21.43.

If we assume a conservative P/E ratio of 20, that works out to a share price of roughly $430; Good investment. I expect to see a decent return 2026-2027.; Starlink can bring service to cell phones if the FCC majorly decreases regulations. ASTS can bring 5G to pre-existing cell phones once they launch more satellites. They can do it with far less satellites than Starlink. Their tech is better and they have patents. 

However... The FCC is only in America. ASTS is poised to be successful with their superior tech everywhere on Earth.; Bought mine about 6 months ago. Added to my position quite a few times. They are competing for market share just like GSAT. Both are good buys

“Buy it and forget it”; Don’t force yourself to like a company .; My biggest holding. 10k shares at 5$ average. 

You really should do some more research . ASTS subreddit. Kook, anpanman, catse on Twitter.

You're thesis on starlink being a direct competitor isn't way off...but they lack their sats aren't equipped for D2C voice and video without some serious regulation changes,  which they won't get. And if you think for a second Verizon, att, Vodafone,  Rakuten ( the list goes on ) would ditch asts for starlink...I just don't see it happening.

It was 100% a long term hold. The threat of more dilution does loom, but grows less and less likely by the day. Their block 1 sats are working/testing right now. I would expect a positive update in the earnings report. Block 2 scheduled for Q1. Once block 1 is up and running they will.be generating revenue, to take some of the worry of further dilution away...

If you are looking at opening a position now, we seem to be in a holding pattern between 22 and 27ish. DCA might be the wise choice...but as we've seen before, news can come at any time...; Your DD appears to be extremely cursory. You’d do yourself a world of good if you deep dive into the ASTSpacemobile subreddit where you’ll find some crazy levels of analysis from RF engineers and investors. This company has the potential to have the biggest subscription service of any company in history. They have first mover advantage, they have patents, they have over 40 agreements with MNOs worldwide, with which comes huge lobbying power (not that they need it, whereas Starlink does). 

Yes they don’t have the funds at the moment to build out the entire constellation but they don’t need to. Government contracts and Exlm loans are both in the pipeline, and they have almost enough to build out the first 25 satellites, which will bring them to cashflow positive.

Don’t forget, the contracts you refer to are only pre-payments. Vodafone have 500 mil subscribers worldwide. Even if you assume a 10% uptake rate (50 mil) of the service from Vodafone alone at a conservative price of $2 per month (and ASTS take a 50% cut), ASTS would be taking in $50 mil PER MONTH from Vodafone alone. In other words, that 100 mil prepayment would be enough to cover just two months of service even at very conservative estimates. The money tree has only just started to grow. This company will have the biggest subscription service of any company in history. $500-$1,000 stock by 2030.

Edit: Starlink is not serious competition. Their satellites are not big enough, not to mention they have other tech limitations. At most they will only be able to do phone calls and texts, unreliably.; It's a Reddit darling and there are 100's of threads on ASTS. They have the best satellite technology but Starlink is hot on their heels. Starlink has more satellites in orbit today, with the SpaceX ability to launch on demand. There is room for multiple players in this space, and it's good for consumers to have options.; 24/7 internet service will cover the globe and be the standard for internet in the near future.

Everyone will want to adopt it, there will be no more dead zones or zones without reach (Unless your underground).

All Major telecommunication companies are partnering with ASTS. They have the superior broadband and technology.

Starlink has 6,700 satellites, ASTS can perform better service with 1/30 of those numbers.


Anyone in the globe who has a smartphone can access the internet  now once the satellites are in the air.

ASTS will 20x from the current price, potentially more.; One of my biggest long term holdings. ; I belive 2025 is going to be a good year for ASTS; I bought some like 5 years ago and forgot about it.; The stock has a cult like following, so you are getting very biased answers from those who want it to succeed. I will probably get downvoted to oblivion for this. 

Both ASTS and Starlink provide a certain amount of bandwidth to a fixed area via their sats. Right now Starlink can do 10 Mbps total on that beam, which DOES allow for phone/video streaming technically but in practice that beam would cover hundreds of users and therefore only support texts by each person. As SpaceX continues to increase sats in orbit, they will have more and more beams which means they can give each person more individual bandwidth. 

ASTS can do more output per satellite, but their sats are much more complex and expensive. They can launch about 5 satellites at a time vs Starlink doing ~20. Also keep in mind launch costs - ASTS is paying ~3 times more per launch vs Starlink since SpaceX is vertically integrated. 

Also ASTS claims first mover advantage, but they seem to have lost that as SpaceX has now fully deployed their first orbital shell and has worldwide coverage. Meanwhile ASTS is still waiting on a permit from the FCC for about 9 months now!

The way ASTS doesn't even know how they'll make revenue or how much is concerning, assuming the phone company tacks on a blanket fee to EVERY subscriber and pay ASTS regardless if they use the service seems like very wishful thinking. 

Long story short - ASTS has good tech in a big emerging market, but I don't think they can compete against vertically integrated SpaceX with reusable rockets.; Personally I think the company may be a success, but there are a lot of current headwinds and space comms has historically been more of a company breaker than company maker. I'm old enough to remember Iridium, Starlink really benefitted from being second mover in that sense, they saw the mistakes Motorola made in their $5B bet. 

It looks like they have some good contracts, but there's so much capital investment required, and they have to keep doing everything right, no setbacks. I had a few shares, just kinda dipping my toe in the water, but my take is that they're so far from profitability with so much investment necessary before then, I'd rather wait and buy in when success looks a little more imminent. Made the opposite mistake with Quantumscape buying into that a couple years ago, it's finally starting to show some momentum with the testing of vehicle batteries but it just traded sideways for years. Even now, they're talking ""by 2030"" for commercial launch. When success is way out in the future, FOMO is usually a mistake, just wait for a good entry point when it'll have some positive catalysts and let the institutions carry the shares until then.; Reading this thread is hilarious. Really shows how underground the opportunity still is. People have no vision and don't bother putting in the work, sad day for you brothas. The funny thing is I first heard about this stock in r/stocks in a thread where people were listing out their favorite game changing stock tickers a few years ago.; ASTS is like when Steve Jobs pulled the iPhone out of his pocket live on stage. It will change the world and use cases not yet conceived will be birthed. Money will rain down from the sky.; I prefer LUNR; I've been in out of ASTS, had a position of 800 shares at once @ $24 this was 3 months ago I missed the run up. This is a high risk, high reward stock , burning HEAPS of cash weekly. I do want to jump back in, but I were to id play it safe, have the money sitting there saved up untill the sats are up in the sky and making revenue , Since I missed the run up id rather pay $40 a share when there successful and start making profit , rather than pay $25 a share living of hopes and hope they don't go bankrupt and they hit all their milestones; I prefer RKLB; Elon will make sure he gets every contract going forward (if he isn’t fired by March) 

So I don’t want to touch ASTS until
Musk is gone; If you can’t see ASTSs potential you have some serious goggles on. You will regret it down the road; ASTS needs several billion dollars to build its satellites, they have $500 million after diluting their shareholders few months ago. They will need to dilute continually, this is a very capital-intensive business. They will either declare bankruptcy or become one of those wannabe TV satellite companies barely limping by as T and VZ collect any minuscule revenue. They will not survive against Musk's Starlink, no matter what the cult tells you about their superior ""tech""

https://www.fierce-network.com/wireless/can-direct-cell-satellite-services-make-money; Starling isn’t partnering with telco’s, it’s their competition ; ASTS needs much more money to build their network of satellites.  That means dilution, a lot of dilution.  I'm not touching this stock.; ASTS is an easy short.; seems like a scam company.; Scam.

You have no idea how up in arms their customer base would get by $2/mo.

It sounds trivial but it's not to them I work in the industry; [deleted]; I’m stacking shares to hold this one long term. Really excited to see where it goes!; The global angle is actually huge here. While everyone's focused on the FCC and US market, ASTS has partnerships across multiple continents. They don't need to wait for US regulatory green lights to start operating in other markets that are desperate for connectivity. Plus their satellite-to-phone tech is way more efficient - they can cover the same area with fewer satellites than Starlink would need. The patent moat is just icing on the cake.; So, you do know Starlink got the go-ahead back at the end of November right?

The hurricanea and the emergency approval took the fight out of most of what people had to try to really restrict them down too severely. 

So the clock is ticking for AST. It isn't superior technology, if it is a space game and the technology is still primarily on earth and the competition has theirs up and running in space.; This. 👆Like the chart, if it presents an opportunity. Not the company.; I've been aware of ASTS since 2020s lol. I regret not getting the cheap warrants at the time. The thing that put me off was the funding. I just couldn't see a guarantee for the launching and deployment of so many satellites without a big backer of sorts. Is there a clear path to future funding now?; How do they launch their satellites ?; I’m completely ignorant on this so forgive me! I thought starlink offered broadband speeds for home use.  What am i missing here?
Edit. Different tech to communicate with phones not on most older starlink sats.; This is the problem, it is their to lose. By 2030, it could very well be a ""hey, what ever happened to Nokia"". But instead of Nokia, it is AST.; Every stock has a cult following because investors doesnt want to lose their money and egos; You make all very fantastic points. This is one of those thread where I think people need to look at the logic. Look at the up and down votes, and double check it against the news. 

>The stock has a cult like following, so you are getting very biased answers from those who want it to succeed. I will probably get downvoted to oblivion for this. 

I am getting the downvote. So hopefully they leave you alone. I got hate for pointing out Starlight got FCC approval. (It's public record, tons of news stories). 

I get wanting it to be successful, but I also strongly believe if you are going to invest in technology you should understand what it is for and what the competition is, because it can change very quickly. 

>Also ASTS claims first mover advantage, but they seem to have lost that as SpaceX has now fully deployed their first orbital shell and has worldwide coverage. Meanwhile ASTS is still waiting on a permit from the FCC for about 9 months now!

They did, for quite some time. The same was true for Boeing, who was another one sitting at the top and who has fallen. ASTS is at risk of that. Contracts are only good if there is actually service to provide.  I have one of the companies ""signed up for service"" with ASTS. It is not an option to get, so they are not delivering. 

But realistically, if they can't deliver or if he gets an upgraded network, they lost when it was completely theirs to win. That is exactly the thing, stock research absolutely needs to look at who is the power hungry company nipping at the heels, that will take someone down given the chance. 

None of them have been able to explain how ASTS is going to get back ahead from falling behind.; You really do give good advice!; This is wrong on so many levels. remindMe! 5 years.; Its alright we'll help them funding their growth the way investing was meant to be and you can jump in when other will have done it for you. 

Youre welcome; I'm going to be a multi millionaire in 5 years and people in this thread will still be chasing, wondering where the next amazon is; Apples and oranges.; Why not both?; You will pay $100 or $200 a share when the satellites start making profit. ; I'd do both, and that's my plan. I have a portion I've bought already that I'm profitable on, but it's as much as I wanted to put into a riskier play at this moment. As they keep succeeding and lowering the risk I'll add more at the higher price. My average will go up, but with the risk going down then the massive upside will be more likely.; Not similar at all; I prefer hood ..  ffs

/s; They COMPLEMENT each other. RKLB - even when their satellite constellation is launched - won't compete with ASTS as there's no change RKLB go for a D2C constellation. It's too crowded already. So buy RKLB for the Launch, Space Systems, and future constellation and add ASTS for the D2C global leading service. Combined you have two of the biggest opportunities locked up.; they have enough capital to launch their initial sats. they have just a small shortfall of the cash needed to launch enough to get to a self funding position.; Starlink has T-Mobile. My understanding is most of Starlink’s current satellites simply don’t have the right antennas that will work with mobile phones, but their new satellites do. They previously weren’t really trying to get into the satellite internet to cell phones market, which is why AST managed to beat them to getting a bunch of contracts. But if that changes, I don’t really see anyone going with AST. They don’t even have enough satellites in orbit to offer what they’re saying they want to; They have enough funds to build out their constellation to 25 sats. Management guided that they will be fully cash flow neutral at this point & will be able to sustain the cost of building out further satellites from the revenue of the 25.; I think they've got enough funds to carry them into profit; How do you figure? Have you inside info? Hundreds of telecom experts have looked over their business plan and did their due diligence before signing hundreds of millions in contracts, so for now I'm going to lean with their research as to the potential of this.; Nah, I was actually curious what everyone’s thoughts were. I put a few hundred dollars in as a gamble. We’ll see what happens; ASTS is capable of full data transmission, not just voice. All those devices would be included...; There is also the FirstNet contract for first responders. I've talked to some forest service firefighters that didn't know about ASTS and were very excited about the possibilities. They said they currently haul out a mobile cell tower out close to the fire and reception is spotty depending on the line of sight. ASTS would eliminate the need to drive a cell tower up a mountain.; Even reducing those numbers 10x it still is a much higher share price than it is right now. But then add on the other 30+ telcos that have agreements with ASTS. 

People may pay a premium to have no dead zones with voice and data, or it could be an optional add-on, either way there are a lot of potential customers all over the world that deal with large dead zones. Lots of rural areas that people live in and drive through. 

My cell phone company contract just raised their prices $5 a month, and other carriers have done that recently too. A few bucks for better service coverage will be absorbed the same way all inflation does,  grumbling, and making cuts to purchases. At least this would be adding a needed service for hundreds of millions of people around the world.; It's worth running different numbers to see the outcome if we're doing a true DD.

Let's use the reduced subscriber numbers from a previous post, because I think that's valid...

>VZ + ATT go from 260M to 140M subs. If we assume the same ratio for Vodofone, it goes from 330M to 220M.

At those subscriber levels and $2 / mo to the subscriber, it works out to earnings of $1.8B / year.

If we reduce that cost to $1 / mo, we're still at $900M / yr earnings, or $6.03 EPS. At $6.03 EPS & P/E = 20, that's a share price of $120.60, or a little under 5x where we are now.

If we go even further, and reduce margin from the estimated 80% to 50%, all the math works out to $74 per share.

We're still ignoring the other 37 MNOs that have already signed agreements with AST, as well as government use (the SDA has selected AST as a prime contractor in the HALO program).

I think no matter how you slice it, the current range of $22-$26 is very undervalued.; Even if $2 is too high and they end up on a smaller number, he's only considered those three MNOs so far, there's plenty more like Rakuten (promising ASTS coverage in 2026) and even the military has use cases.

That number is achievable if they can execute.; This is an open discussion. If you want to share your thesis with the rest of the class, we're all interested in reading it. There's been a great discussion below where we've changed the numbers of users, $$ per month, profit margins, etc..., I'm certainly not ready to die on any hill, so if you have a reasonable argument, feel free to make it; The EU is a lot less prone to bribing regulators as well, so even if Starlink gets to pollute the spectrum in the US, there is no chance they get EU approval. There is no software replacement for antenna size, and even Starship & bigger Starlink sats won't change the equation for ASTS. Starlink's main advantage is mass producing cheap satellites, but ASTS has been able to keep production costs low considering the engineering complexity of their sats.; From what I understand, ASTS can provide 5G, Starlink only can provide emergency calls and texts.; This is nonsense if you're a position trader (which you need to be if you're even looking at ASTS). Sure, you need to like the chart if you're planning on jumping in and out in a half hour and scalping 2%, but if you want to be an investor instead of a trader, you really need to know the company you're investing with.; Its about a year of rocky waters for their finances

End of 25 and they will be providing service to Japan via Rakuten and likely other island type nations

My guess is that the worst risk is not on funding but satellites blowing up or failing to arrive to orbits as expected. That would set them back by months; The ones so far where spacex but I believe they have a contract with bezos thing, bluebird or whatever it’s called; That service requires a receiver type box installed in the home. The service being discussed in this post is direct to cellular service with unmodified phones.; Home use broadcast requires a large dish on the surface. People aren't carrying an satellite dish around with them in their pocket. 

ASTS simply works as is with phones already made, but they are not a replacement for a dedicated internet cable line.; Ya except it’s high tech satellites in space, kind of a higher barrier to entry.; By the same token, the new standard we all get used to is having cell service literally everywhere thanks to satellites and we consider it antiquated that there were ever black spots. AST is way ahead in providing it; The Starlink FCC approval was for texting only. There is a waiver request from Starlink in the courts right now, because in order for them to provide voice, they need to significantly interfere with ground based telecom. They got an emergency waiver during Helene because there was no ground based telecom, but there is zero evidence that the FCC is planning on loosening regulations on a permanent basis. Meanwhile, AST's technology (patent protected) somehow threads the needle and doesn't interfere with ground based communication. Both AT&T and Verizon have dumped a lot of money into AST, and if the FCC somehow decides to grant Starlink's waiver, they'll be going to war to protect their investment.

Starlink has a car, while AST has a scooter. AST is saying ""we can easily operate a delivery service in Time Square, exactly as it all is right now"", while Starlink is saying ""we can operate a delivery service in Times Square, but you need to let us run over a bunch of people while we do it. Can we get a waiver? ""; How is ASTS falling behind? They have less satellites up since starlink has been doing this for longer, but their SATs are completely different. Starlinks current satellites cannot deliver what ASTS can, and to truly compete they'd have to launch a whole new fleet, which involves designing new satellites. So Starlink are the ones who are falling behind.

If ASTS can't deliver what they promised or have major setbacks then they absolutely could lose their tech advantage. 

It's a gamble stock, but ever successful launch and test makes it less of a gamble, and since no one else can deliver the same service they still have the advantage. And with 45+ telecom services around the world signed up with them, once they get their fleet running they'll have a massive market. 

If you want safe companies to invest in that deliver consistent returns then there are plenty of those out there. If you want to try to get in early on a company that could 10x then that's a lot harder to find.; I will be messaging you in 5 years on [**2029-12-27 07:21:34 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2029-12-27%2007:21:34%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hn1cm0/thoughts_on_ast_space_mobil_asts/m401yvz/?context=3)

|-|-|-|-|; There's a reason that private and public capital have historically been separate things. If you're managing a $600B portfolio, you have the luxury of taking on different degrees of risk, even those with a 10+ year pay out. For an investor not able to shape the market, not everything makes sense in the public investment realm. What's their PE? What's the forward PE? What's the PE gonna be 2 years from now? Those are all short term questions and there's still a ton of uncertainty between now and potential profitability, and sometimes a stealth competitor that moves more efficiently wins the race, on a long horizon that makes little old me without the capital to shape their company strategy someone just buying into promises, which there's sometimes something there. 

I do like their niche, and with this crazy market companies don't really need revenues to soar so I may miss out on a big gainer, but I'll prob have my money somewhere else for a year or two as I evaluate their progress, if it gets too rich for me by then well I guess it'll just be one I missed.; Why not COST too while were at it; What I mean Is have the money saved ready for go day; Even if Starlink succeeds in matching ASTS technology, (they're years behind at the moment) and they both get a fleet of satellites, there is still room for competition. Billions of people around the world, lots of countries and phone companies. Not everyone will be willing to join a Musk led company anymore. Countries and companies may even see him as a security risk.; They have zero revenue. It can cease to exist tomorrow.; They certainly won’t.  There are plenty of CAT-M devices that don’t.  There is almost no use case for FWA customers to use ASTM.  And why would carriers tack on a mandatory $2 charge to prepaid customers (their most price conscious)?; Why would EU block this? EU usually fights against anti-competition. This would bring competition to the traditional antennas etc.; They have been doing the beta testing for a few weeks for the original roll out plan. Which from what I understand is starting with more of a poor connection/emergency response situation and going from there. 

Not personally on T-Mobile or know anyone on them because of how bad their service is in my area. Did know someone who used it during the hurricane, said the connection worked well. But he was also saving power he was not on his phone 24/7 for me to ask all my technical questions. 

There is also the fact that AST is having to go to SpaceX to get their satellites launched because of how much the rest of the competition has mangled their rocket programs. 

My point is this, I don't know that I have seen enough out of ASTS that says ""we are still in the front"", that they may have actually been distracted and as no one was paying attention, Musk got an extensive network in place. So now it is the matter of what matters more. 5G but not enough coverage, coverage and probably needing to catch up on some of the call quality. 

Seems like it isn't a sure bet on ASTS.; I see, what's the timeline to completion from now, 4 years?; They've already announced their cadence next year. 1 sat on IRSO in Q1, 2 launches on Falcon 9 w/ 4 ea in Q2/3, 1 launch on New Glenn w/ 8 sats in late Q4 for a total of 17 in 2025; So far SpaceX, Blue Origin (Bezos), and some Indian company; Bluebirds are dpacemobile satellites, Blue Origon is Bezo's rocket company and the rocket is New glenn. 

There you go my friend.; Ah excellent thank you! I had just edited my original with what i had found too.; You're talking about Out Of Band Emissions (OOBE), in order for SpaceX to broadcast at their max power they need a waiver to relax requirements for additional OOBE that their analysis, and T Mobiles, shows does NOT interfere with ground based telecoms. 

Of course AST and their friends are claiming it does interfere (we haven't seen anything that wasn't redacted so can't independently agree with AST) and are pushing back hard. Of course this is likely a stall tactic to delay SpaceX from rolling out more service. In any event, SpaceX can still get around this with new satellites and meanwhile ASTS application with the FCC is still pending for over 9 months...good luck boys.; Exactly 😂😂; You lose your investment edge at that point. Your move is made on the run up to dominance. ; Institutions are gonna jump on this well before the lights come on and revenue starts streaming. You do have some time to get in, but trying to time this is not going to work well.; They have the money to launch enough satellites to bring in money, and have many avenues to raise more money.; Let's say that you're right so we can keep conservative numbers. You very well could be, so I agree, it's correct to stay consistent if we're going to be conservative with projections...

VZ + ATT go from 260M to 140M subs. If we assume the same ratio for Vodofone, it goes from 330M to 220M.

That's $140M / mo from the US and $44M from Vodafone / mo, or a total of $2.256B / year. At 80% margin, that's $1.8B earnings per year.

That's $12.05 EPS, for a share price of $241; Starlink D2C has issues with emitting radiation outside the alloted spectrum because the sats are not designed for this purpose. They transmit at a higher power and some of it leaks out causing interference for other users. This is why the FCC has not approved it and why the EU will never approve it in its current state.; I'd suggest you read up more on ASTS and their advantage. Your posts appear confused as to what they offer. Also, Starlink doesn't have satellites that can compete with ASTS in terms of bandwidth and to make existing ones even able to offer slightly better bandwith (still significantly behind ASTS) they need full permission from the FCC to operate in lower orbit. Even when the new trump FCC provides them with this, they will likely still get sued by the MMOs for interference.

I wish people would do some basic research before posting so confidently.; For global coverage? Something like that; So that is 

8 hopefully with Bezos (on the one he has been trying to get off the ground for 4 years)
1 Other 
8 on SpaceX

Might want to ask Boeing about those astronauts.; Money they are currently paying to SpaceX.; We can also completely ignore the U.S market entirely and this stock would still be a potential Telecom behemoth. 

Revenue split agreements already in place with 45 Global MNO's representing 2.5 Billion customers outside USA including Rakuten Mobile, Bell Canada, Orange, Telefonica, TIM, Saudi Telecom Company, Zain KSA, Etisalat, Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison, Telkomsel, Smart Communications, Globe Telecom, Millicom, Smartfren, Telecom Argentina, MTN, Telstra, Africell, Liberty Latin America and others. 

I wonder why Starlink hasn't been able to ink these agreements as they try to pivot into the DTC market with satelittes that still can't achieve more than texting while AST has demonstrated they can stream youtube videos on a remote island requiring only 90 sats for global coverage vs the 20,000+ Elon needs to launch.; yep, I think I read somewhere that they need to put 167 more satellites into orbit.; Well, New Glenn is supposed to be launching on 12/31. Whether that happens or not is yet to be seen.

Carrying cargo and carrying people are apples and oranges. SpaceX had no plans to be bringing those astronauts home, so it's hard to fault SpaceX for not being ready to jump. On the other hand, Falcon 9 has an amazing track record for cargo launches. There is a risk that Musk loses his damned mind and just tells AST to piss off, but I think I remember reading somewhere that he legally can't do that. 

I'm not going to bother to look it up, but something tells me he can't deny a launch simply because it's a competitor.; For launching. SpaceX is launching their starlink competitor. Asts also has launched planned with other rockets; Do those MOU’s outline revenue sharing? That would be uncommon. They only have contracts with ATT, Vodafone, and Rakuten afaik; I completely agree, but it gets really tricky to guesstimate revenue from those carriers. As an example (and I have absolutely no idea what the actual # is), maybe cell service is like $2USD / mo in Saudi Arabia right now. What piece of the pie could ASTS hope to get from that on a monthly basis? $.05 per sub? 

While those carriers are great to have, revenue will mostly come from NA, Europe, and Australia, followed by Oceania and the ME. African countries and India have a shit load of potential subscribers, but they're very poor.; Around there yea, probably a bit more eventually with LEO becoming saturated with other SpaceX and China’s operators; Missed the point. Boeing was supposed to be bringing them home, now it is SpaceX. How many other contracts have converted to SpaceX because of failure to be able to deliver. (I lost count, but it is more than a few from the Biden  Administration alone). 

Those 8 for Bezos may actually convert to SpaceX. If he still can't get the ship off the ground. 

I don't think Musk would turn them down at all. It is less money out of his pocket ultimately, and that is the problem for ASTS.; CapEx for building cell towers is huge. ASTS will be supplementary for coverage gaps in the western world. In the third world, it will likely be the only chance at connectivity a lot of people will have.; lol if you think phone plans in Saudi Arabia are $2/ month USD.... maybe do some googling around to see how much people pay for a prepaid 5G data plan in even the poorest countries of Africa and Asia...; Ahh, gotcha. I thought you were saying Blue Origin is a toss up (agreed) -and- SpaceX could be a problem as well. I'm pretty sure SpaceX will launch for anyone for the time being.; The average cell phone bill in sub-saharan Africa is $5-$8. The average in India is about $3. The same $3 in Indonesia. Saudi Arabia is about $34, so I was off on that one.

Regardless, it's folly to assume the rest of the world is willing to pay what people in NA or EU will pay."
33,18yo just started stocks recently besides some stupid options plays,I am barely getting into actually buying stocks and roth ira and I would like to gather any advice that will help me out. These are some of the stocks that I have recurring investments in. Anything I should add or take off?,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hn190p,0,2024-12-27 00:35:21,"People will tell you to diversify because you are all in tech but I think being young you can afford to take risks for another 5-7 years until you should consider diversifying more. Keep an eye out for some speculative stocks that you could see being worth much more in the future and I think you should invest more in these at your age than you should when you are in your 30s. Now is the time that you can take some risks that can pay off later but be very careful about this. At your age it might be harder to distinguish between a risky play and a stupid play. You start to understand the difference with more experience.; Just buy VTI and VOO and anything you can spare to never see again in BTC; Do not listen to people here if they are telling you to buy crypto or any non ETF tickers. They’re sitting on bags and want those bags to be worth something. I’m guessing the next person to post will say some sort of Penny stock.; This has all been either sarcastic or intentionally bad advice. Please head over to r/bogleheads to learn more about early investing. You should have more than 5% of your portfolio in individual stocks until you learn more about investing. Start by building a solid foundation. Most people use VTI since it covered total US. Then they add in some international VXUS. You can also skip two funds and just buy VT and own the world while you are still learning.; Are you only investing in Roth right now? Just remember your contribution limits.; You’re doing great. Keep the contributions going and forget about it unless you run into any financial issues. If this is ALL retirement money, you might want to consider investing just regular everyday money too. 

My general rule is 15% of income to retirement. Everything else I can save goes into stocks. QQQ is my biggest one. Then some TSLA and others. But I really think TSLA is overvalued right now.; gamestop is debt free, with 4.6billion in cash and profitable; I’m not tryna be teach bear, I have a lot tech as well but maybe diversify a little more. Maybe some JPM for the financial sector and COST for consumer defensive. 

You have time on your side so pullbacks aren’t really an issue but tech is notoriously high beta so you’ll feel it when downturn happens.; Bitcoin is better👍; Put in % 
Also buy GME; gamestop; I second $VOO. My roth ira is 100% into it since 2015 and I've had healthy returns, but I suppose that's subjective.; Yes only roth; He’s 18, he should be taking as much risk as possible now.; I’d wait to buy it at like 35k after the next dip though.; I almost upvoted this because I thought it said Puts on GME.; Also, just remember that it is in there for the long haul. You cannot withdraw from your IRAs until you hit the age....blanking on the actual age at the moment.; Lmao if you think it’s going back to 35k ever again then I have a bridge to sell you😂😂😂; Lol I remember when someone said that to me after it hit 69k the first time and I said I’d wait for 30k. I actually got in after it hit 15k."
34,New Investor Give me tips (18 yrs),H,https://i.redd.it/37andlcl999e1.jpeg,23,2024-12-26 21:48:31,"Never enable options trading or margin trading as a beginner.; Never eat yellow snow.; Don’t take advice from readditors. DYOR.; 1.) don’t try to “time” the market, buy in at regular intervals at a set pace that you can afford. I.e. $100 a monthly, weekly, etc. if you do this, you will find your stocks rising in a healthy way with less extreme ups and downs. 

2.) invest for the long term, don’t put any money in the market you’re not ok with going into the red (negative return) for at least 5 years. Covid 2.0 or some other economic disaster could be around corner and nobody would know. If you had money in the market you will need in 5 months it could screw you and make you take a heavy loss on your money. 

3.) don’t panic sell at a loss, the market will always go up over time. The market could crash tomorrow and your money could be down %70 and some will get scared enough to sell. Instead think of it as a heavy discount on stocks, the perfect time to be buying not selling. This followsthe most universal principle buy low sell high. 

4.) albert Einstein is quoted saying something along the lines of “compounding interest is the 8th wonder of the world.” Learn compounding interest, understand it, utilize it. It’s is extraordinarily powerful. The basic premise is this. If you earn %10 every year, the larger and larger the sum of that %10 will grow every year. 

5.) have an exit strategy. Set a goal, whether that be financial freedom, a certain percentage return, retirement, a house. Set a goal and abide by that goal. Money has no use if you don’t eventually use it for your life.; Put money in and forget about it.; Buy indexes, not stocks, and trade minimally.; Never underestimate the power of compounding interest and a simple DCA routine you can sustain.  Lots to be said for time in the market with ETFs.; Keep doing what you are doing.; Stick with ETFs.  They have Apple Nvda and tsla in them anyway.  So if you want more risk go more on VOOG versus VOO; If I were you. 3 Things:

1) Buy the obvious - VOO/SPY. Dont bother to research too much because your own research and judgment depend on how much you know.

2) Buy often and as much as possible, at least 30% of what you make in total. Dont care about how much it grows or waste time waiting for the price to go low or where you want to be. Best if you automate this stuff.

3) This is the most important one. NEVER SELL.


Have an emergency fund in your chequing account.; Don't open a trade without an exit plan.; 2025 will be the age of AI, and all the years after that, AI is going to be huge, you're going to have to go buy some, stocks in the chip space; But some PLTR; The only tips you’ll get are VOO and hold. I’m 19 and the only thing I can say is keep doing what you’re doing. Got plenty of time and room to take some risks. Personally I like space stocks because I believe in our lifetime space travel will become more prominent, I’ll list a few but many people will also call these meme stocks so best to do your own research. LUNR, RKBL, QBTS, ASTS. On a larger scale AMD, GOOGL, MSFT, META. Open a Roth IRA and max it out every year if you can and focus on ETFs. Like I said I’m 19 so I don’t even have the proof yet but this seems like the right path.; BBAI, great buy on SOUN, just a bit high but then again everything will be high (I got in 1k shares are 2.13). 

Look into UAMY. China ban confirmed for antimony imports UAMY will go thru the roof given they are the biggest and most established US antimony procurement of metals in the US. 

NVTS another id look at 

Diversify into crypto XRP limit buy at 2.00 either scalp (dry limit sell 2.90 or keep accumulating up until about 2.25 and hold. This has the biggest potential to go parabolic price point wise within the next year; Fbcv; i believe you are looking for QQQM, not QMMM; Do not listen to anyone. Analyze the graphs religiously they are predictable. But most importantly be ready to sell at any moment; Tip:   Its not a horse race where you just put money on a name.; -Max your Roth IRA. 
-Dollar cost average with automatic investing. 
-Don’t trade on emotions
-Don’t try to jump in on “hot stocks” when the market has them over inflated. 
-Diversify; Focus on maxing our your roth ira. Market is rigged and media will entice you to sell low and buy high. Never sell if you really need the money. DCA into the market and double your DCA when there is a market crash or correction.; Don’t emotion buy or sell. But consistently and hold.; ChatGPT is really, really useful for learning about the stock market.

I'm sorry this is so fkin cringe, but the info is good.

The second piece of advice is from Peter Lynch, which is to stick to stocks that make a product that you yourself use and believe in. This is especially good advice for someone who’s 18 because those stocks should be appealing to this new generation and therefore have longevity.

I guess there is a third piece of advice, which is to avoid market disruptions and don’t go all in on one day. Try to invest the same amount on a regular basis whether it’s weekly or monthly or each paycheck.

I used to be more stocks; I’ve gradually trimmed them down.; 100% stock picks, beating s&p by 3x this year; I gradually moved from 90% index to 75% over the past couple yrs and have had a bit of good luck and haven't really reallocated.


Right now it's about 65% voo/vti 20% individual stocks goog/amzn 10% speculative type stuff, 5% cash.; 10% etf 70% individual stocks, 15% crypto, 5% gold/silver; 60% All world ETF.
30% individual stocks.
10% gold en btc.; 73% index funds, 17% stock picks, 10% crypto; I’m 99% into mind geek and 1% into crystal meth; TSLA. Meme stock. About 10%.; 100% index; About 20% individual. Going down as I put more in SP500 over time.; 5% index, 95% individual picks; I started with all index funds but moved to over 50% individual. Which I’m still up over 50% across all individual stocks. I started leaning that way to get the bigger returns that the ETFs often mirror. I do landscaping and run power tools all day so I have headphones in for hours mon-fri. During that time I listen to so much about individual companies, many opinions, earnings, conference calls, everything I can. I figure if I can mitigate some risk with knowledge I might as well. I’m only 32 and I make good money so I want to accumulate as much as possible as fast as possible.; 0% in individual stocks. I do have options in the company I work at but I get those for free.; 20% CASH (exited some positions recently, going to wait and see what happens post inauguration), 60% ETF, 20% Individual stocks with no more than 3% initial investment per stock.; Suggestion, Chip away at VWRL if there is a stock you are dying to buy.; 60% etfs (401k) and 40% individuals (private brokerage / Roth).; My TFSA- all my own holdings. 

My RRSPs and RESPs- all managed by various bank mutual funds.; 65% ETFs, 35% stocks; About 95% index funds (mostly FZROX & FNILX), 5% single stocks. I hold 36 different companies, biggest positions are NVDA, MSFT, and SYF. NVDA & SYF started out as [half-positions](https://www.financialsamurai.com/unsure-about-an-investment-decision-go-halfsies/) and grew into their current size.

My stock picks are doing well but I prefer to keep it to a relatively small amount so I can approach it as a hobby. I wouldn’t want to stake too much of my future on understanding Mastercard’s [blockchain strategy](https://www.mastercard.com/global/en/business/fintech/fintech-programs/startpath/for-startups/crypto.html).; 95% ETFs; I’m like you, probably 75 / 25. At the end of the day, huge gains on stocks are fun, but tax efficiency ultimately wins out. These ETFs they got now are the bomb.; 10% ETF (Roth), and 90% in GOOG, MSFT, and AMZN.; 75% etf.

My stocks are RDDT, HUBS, KVYO, O, and a little bit of DLR; 80% stocks 20% cash; 14% Cash

44% ETF

12% Individual stocks

30% BTC/Gold; I got about 100k in the S&P500 in my 401k, and like 90k in individual stocks between the Roth and brokerage account.  I've been trying to keep it a 50/50 split; About 50% indexes. Mainly VOOG and some VTI.

Then MSFT, AMZN, GOOG, COST, NVDA, TSM in that order.; 100% ind stocks; 100%; Just had to look! 60%stocks, 40%etfs. Ive been increasing etfs more than stocks this year but some of the stock I have killed it! 

TSM, Amazon. 


Additionally I have GOOG, penny stock G E V O, and Microsoft. 


Ill keep all these. G E V O has a lot of potential imp but it's been a bumpy ride with huge gains and losses this year. Well see, it's my get rich stock if they succeed.; I have a little under 25% in individual stocks - a mix of decent dividend paying stocks such as banks, pipelines, telecoms as well as Nvidia and Amazon. I only plan to DRIP into these so they should go down as a percentage over time.  These are legacy stocks from when I was 100% individual stocks. 

The rest are in global equity ETFs such as VT, XEQT (Canadian - since this is where I live) and a balanced Swiss one from when I lived there 75/25 equity/bonds. I also have a <10% bond ETF. Going forward, I’ll likely just reinvest the dividends into the non-Cdn ETFs with new money going into XEQT. I’ll think about rebalancing 5 years from retirement.; Good question. Roughly 50% individual stocks and 50% mutual funds. Of the mutual funds, it’s about 40% large cap growth, 30% mid cap blend, and 30% small cap blend.; 50% ETF, 30% diversified Holding Companies who claim they beat the market (Berkshire + some others), 20% individual stocks (a few high conviction companies). The actual percentage fluctuates but this 50-30-20 is the goal.; 100% ETFs; Right now, over 75% in index funds (like QQQ and VTI) which will change within the first weeks in January to SGOV or USFR.; For retirement/tax advantaged accounts: All ETFs. 

For taxable portfolio: 70 percent ETFs, 30 percent stocks.  

My taxable portfolio is probably 10 percent of my net investments.; 80% VTI, 10% individual stocks, 10% fixed income; Generally I focus on leading stocks only. The only way to outperform the market consistently is to be consistently invested in the stocks outperforming the market; 25% index, 70% stocks, 5% crypto/PMs; \~60% voo qqq meta amzn. \~20% dripping spyi arrc jepq. \~20% puts/calls/etc.; I'm an active fund manager, so 100% into the fund that is 100% stock picks. But I've always been 100% stock picks since I turned 18, 26 years ago.; ye? what individual stocks did you used to be invested, in out of curiosity; Same; Same; Individual stocks make for a fun experience. Also ive had some ETFs that went nowhere. There are plenty of ETFs that have gone nowhere for years and will continue to do so.; How's the performance? What are your top picks?; Fantastic! Could you share this year picks and next year’s?; A lot of different things, made money on all of them.. bought META after it crashed (sold too early though). A bunch of Canadian REITs at pandemic lows and sold before interest rates came up, Canadian banks and Railroad stocks, Telus, TSM, Suncor, SIA.TO, EXE, JNJ, Google, Enbridge, BAM, Amazon. 

Also a bunch of Canadian penny stocks with a low amount invested. I kept them but they don't really count. Mostly all went to zero or close to it. Only did well on PNG.

The only real stock I kept was BNS because I didn't want to sell at a loss at the time. I'm debating selling now it's well into the green, or just enjoying the dividends and likely some share appreciation.

I may make additional larger stock purchases in the future if I see something that I really think will outperform.; Pltr,rklb,achr,joby,asts,lunr,grab,clov,lcid,hims,sofi,vrt,nvda, AMD,tsla,dell,mu were my picks this year; Top gainers for 2024 were;
Realreal,
Palantir,
Soun,
Sofi,
Ttwo (take two),
And mag 7 (kept buying all major dips)

Next year betting on;
Ttwo (grand theft auto coming next fall, will shoot the stock up imo),
Otgly (cd projeckt),
Realreal,
Celh,
Huma (humacyte),
United health,
Sofi,
Micron (potentially)

Also need to do some research for next good opportunities.

Hope it helps; Also, micron has been steadily bouncing between 80s and 110s.. made some money swing trading it; I am in a bit of a pickle - allowed myself to buy way too many different stocks. I have a few too many ETF’s as well. How did you sell you individual stocks - when they were up and then just dump into an etf? Do you have any ETF’s with covered call strategies?; A bunch of those did really well.  Where did you hear about them?; Thank you!!!; Yeah I just sold when they were in the green.. even though often times it can be better to sell at a loss because you buy something with better potential. I just lump summed into ETFs. I probably have too many ETFs too but I think it really matters that much. Mostly different versions of similar things.; Covered call ETFs are awful and should be avoided.; Most of it was a mix of ""I love space"" and i learned about lunr from their 1st attempt in February thst tilted on the side. Nvidia I caught it late but as a gamer I should have had this for a long time. A lot of them was discovered as I found some community like Amit on YouTube who does market open and close. Some discovered by accident. Some times I sae a random ticker symbol on wsb and did my own DD. A mix bag of things. For 2025 I don't know what I'll do because they are all bangers and for some of them I'm gkad I got in early before they become even bigger. I always complained how I never find good companies to invest in a long term and now I have lol. I learned about options this year too and now I'm thinking of keep the same strategy. Be conservative with calls options that are well priced. Sell CCs far OTM (my account doesn't allow selling of csp) and buy only when there's a dip. I used to invest in the Canadian(because I live there) market and ever since I switched to the US market this year I've made more gains than I had in 4 years from the Canadian sector lol.; I have a similar profile.

Read about them on here.; K going to sell the one I have; That was easy and I hope you do dump it. They underperform terribly and offer little actual downside risk while capping the upside. 

Simplify as much as you possibly can and you’ll be put in fewer tough spots. As much as I loved buying individual stocks it takes time real time to listen to conference calls, look at financials, and even then most of the time I would’ve been better off in Voo. Now I just watch the Fed, pay attention, but don’t have to get in the weeds with individuals. Good luck; Done!  Made some $ and collected lots of dividends"
36,Need some help. What do you guys think about AMD long term? ,"so I have about 100 dollars into AMD at the moment. Looking for advice onto whether keeping it or selling it off for MSTR, ACHR, KULR, etc. what are your opinions off of what AMD has done with their new gpus? How much are they into AI? I want some insight since people here have a lot of research and knowledge! Average cost is 144.92, so about a 13% drawdown all time. Would you guys recommend something else other than MSTR/ACHR/KULR. Here is the portfolio. Any advice is appreciated and welcome! ",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hmv5k4,16,2024-12-26 19:56:20,"AMD is a good company with great leadership currently undervalued. You decide; I bought 5 grand worth when it dipped down to $118 a share a couple weeks ago.

Good company, great product, great management, it just doesn't have the software stack that allows it to contend with NVDA's CUDA at the moment. I think they will do plenty of growing as a company as the AI boom continues, they may never be as big as NVDA as they had a giant head start but you will pay too much for NVDA if you are buying now or anytime in the near future. AMD is on sale and does not have a decade of assumed growth priced into it like NVDA does now.; They have good products, but on AI front (data center), they are lagging behind NVDA due to CUDA, which NVDA has spent decades building it.; Undervalued but performing poorly in the market. I own a lot of shares and am loading up. I think they’ll at least be way bigger in a fee years; I would try to buy single shares instead of fractional shares first. Then add.; Some people call it ""Advanced Money Destruction"", think about it.; I would put the money somewhere else.For sentimental value I would keep some depending on your budget tolerance; Amd is good. Its valued where it should be imo and i think itll go up.

Im in intel because i think its dramatically undervalued; AMD will grow in the coming few years. Their alternative to Cuda, RoCm is catching up to Nvidia tho their still new to the AI GPU space while Nvidia has been in for decades. They are working on the software issues for RoCM and hopefully efforts will be made to address it in 2025 as the CEO received feedback on it. People were saying the same thing between intel and AMD, and AMD beat intel. Products wise, they are going to release new GPUs for their data centres in 2025 and 2026. Maybe u should watch the CES event in Jan 6 or wait until the earnings report before making a decision. Their competiveness won't be dying anytime soon.; I am not sure but from what i've heard there seems to be more trust in de long-term prospects of NVDA.; i think its fairly valued/slightly overvalued rn, look at its valuation ratios compared to it’s competitiors; Apps; I have positions in Nvidia, TSMC, AMD and Intel (largest to smallest positions in that order). Semiconductors, in general, are a good market to be in and each of them are compelling for different reasons. The market demand for chips is so high that it’s far from a zero sum game at the moment.

What AMD has been able to do in the CPU market since the launch of Ryzen has been remarkable. Nobody building an enthusiast system has a compelling reason to use Intel CPUs right now. Unfortunately for AMD, GPUs have been driving the most growth for several years. First with crypto and now AI. AMD needs to make up some ground there to see real growth. 

Right now AMD is conceding the high end/enterprise GPU market to Nvidia and Intel has had some recent successes in the budget market with their ARC GPUs. The middle isn’t a great position to be in for GPUs because PC enthusiasts are usually building on a budget or throwing money at the top of the line parts. And enterprise users are scooping up the high end stuff from Nvidia as fast as they can produce it. AMD really needs to solidify their GPU strategy and put out some compelling products. They may have cornered the PC market for CPUs and console market for APUs, but that’s small potatoes compared to the server farm business.

I’m a little concerned that they’re handcuffed to TSMC, which is risky from a geopolitical standpoint. In fact, one thing Intel has going for it is they’re a US fab. Ironically, that helped AMD get ahead of them, but it could just as easily bite AMD if their partners don’t keep innovating on their ends. 

Overall, I still like AMD; their design focused approach helped catapult them ahead of Intel for CPUs. They also have sort of a folksy underdog appeal that keeps people loyal to their products, which have been very good for several years now. I plan to increase my position when I make my 2025 Roth deposit, but I’ll probably hold firm after that at least until I get a better sense of their GPU trajectory.; Trash; Not a good stock buy Nvidia instead or Amazon; To my knowledge amd is still king on cpus and have been that for about a decade so i would say amd is good long term since you cant run any computer without a cpu.; Currently undervalued but could stay undervalued for years.; They beat Intel. But they cannot deliver the software what AI/ML need for their GPU stack, this is a real risk of AMD.; Thank you! How do they stack up against Nvidia long term?; Couldn’t agree more!; Unless they really keep up with nvidia in 2025 they’re going to get left behind like they did in 2024; Yeah but they will get a share of that market and already are so they don’t need to be the best. Nvidia can’t supply everybody. There is so much demand; This is my “play” money. My full investments are into ETFS and such.; So what do you recommend instead?; Like? I already have about 15k invested into the s&p 500; Well thank you for the insight!; Well thank you for the input!; Why?; I’m only 28 I can wait 😂; Agreed. It’s a bet on leadership; thr truth, terrible. they are laggards. and little chance to catch up in regards to GPUs. They have a good CPU but it doesnt make them competitors in the industry. IMHO AMD is laughable and should not be looked at for gains anytime soon.; Seems like you just looked thru a week of wsb and then jumped ship on most talked stocks. Love it op; Lol you're buying AMD with your play money? There's way better short term momentum stocks right now; Probably hedge. For $1 NVDA buy $2 AMD. Could also add $1 AVGO.; Means other than AMD,as a single stock.There are better ones.S&P ETF(s) that’s a different subject; Amd is Nvda’s weak sister.  They have a run up.  They report good earnings. Weak outlook.  back down.; It won't be long, the future is the age of AI, and it can't be separated from chips; Current pe ratio says its not really undervalued. That being said I own it at 120$ share average.; I mean Lisa Su just won Time CEO of the year so leadership isn’t a problem haha; Idk it’s been working. It’s gambling for a reason LOL; Like?; Xilinx acquisition makes it seem much higher than it really is; It is if she doesn’t get software in order, current reviews of it are not good; Gme; In disinclined to respond to idiots who ask for help while down voting the person they ask advice from. Enjoy making no money from your awful investment strategy. The ole throw shit at everything and see if it works "
37,Which of these Stocks would You totally avoid? ,"I’m starting out my stocks journey and investing $1900 as the start then 60/40 into large/small caps. let me know which stocks are bad and why please (to avoid)

",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hmuge2,99,2024-12-26 19:24:37,"Those are all great stocks. I would avoid the ones I don’t know anything about.; I like the MU and MRVL stocks.; Tesla, not because I think it’s necessarily going to tank, but because it will go up and down based on the status/perception of the Musk-Trump relationship and I’ve had it with roller coasters. I like the rest—reliable, predictable growth. I’m not super confident on Tesla’s business.; Honestly, Tesla. The evaluation makes no sense.; Meta - steady cash flow king in advertising/AR glasses

Amazon - safe conglomerate

Tesla - slightly speculative robotaxi play; S&p; XIC has underperformed the sp500 by 330% over the last 14 years.; Costco and Tesla. Valuation will reset eventually it’s hard to envision multiple expansion from here.; I love Costco but it has gotten too expensive; Tesla is a ponzie scheme; Never invest in a company that cooks their books; TSLA WMT AAPL AMZN COST

Bubble territory for the next 3 or 6 months...; Tesla. I have principles.; I’d etf it if I was you.; tesla, especially with elon elevated presence in the trump administration. stay away until a couple months after inauguration imho

its already overvalued as is; I’d avoid Tesla. Has a long way to drop of him and trump break up; Tsla mrvl definitely in current level; Meta,  Costco, Tesla, Xic

Meta because advertising isn't going to be pulling money in when everyone is struggling for basic goods, Costco because the margins are already razor thin in that industry and tesla because nothing about that balance sheet even comes close to explaining the stock price. It's ridiculously over priced. Wtf is Xic? Pass.

 ; You're doing solid,  

Just $TSLA , it's hype based on Elmo and the potential benefit of him being US president by default.  Me think that it's grossly overvalued. I would get some of my profits and remind myself not to be too greedy as I fear a little rug pull on that one.; None!; Tesla is probably the most volatile one here; All of them. Buy ETFs instead. If you want to add risk, add leverage to one of the indices.; I won't own TSLA.  Erratic CEO, poor quality control, limited product line.  The fan base is the only thing keeping it going but it isn't as resilient as Apple's.; I see you have CAD hedged stocks, how long do you plan to hold them? I have been trying to figure out if I should go with hedged or unhedged; Pretty good companies mostly but how will you track all those? Even hedge funds limit the number of companies around 40-60 with a team of analysts. 

I would honestly go with an index fund like VTI or VOO first to build your base. Then add some tilts if you want like SMH or something down the road.; Walmart and Costco...; PRLD. ; Today I sold my MU position for more GOOG. Nothing that it answers you question, but that’s the direction my portfolio is taking heading into 2025. I’m all in on PLTR & GOOG; Those CDR stock are worth it or not? You keep them long term or trade them often?; Tesla is risky but should not avoid. I would make it lighter portion of your portfolio but I would keep it.; [removed]; OP, what made you choose CDRs for MSFT and GOOG, but not AMZN, COST, or WMT?

You have a lot of great companies there that are worth holding for the long run. Have you considered focusing more on ETFs for S&P500, Nasdaq, or DJI instead of spreading yourself so thin on individual picks?; I own some of the stocks mentions and am pretty content with them. I don’t own META.  For bulls what is the most compelling reason to own META his stick. I know younger generations have dropped it as it is used by lots of older users (my wife for one) with the fickleness of trends why will META be one of the dominant companies in five years. I am not a bear or bull on it. I just am interested in hearing from people on why it will continue to thrive (or become more irrelevant if you are a bear); Great companies bought at high prices are more likely to make for bad investments. Then again nothing makes sense anymore.; - make a whole list of stocks

- upload to Reddit

- Reddit isn't even on the list; I'm ngl, just put your 1 grand into voo or vti....; That’s bait.gif; You can pick 3 ETFs that would be 80% of your portfolio.; I love the $40 in XIC 😂; Starting with $1900 and asking Reddit to pick stocks? Bold move, Cotton. Let’s see how that plays out in the stock market jungle.; What fees are you paying to buy individual stocks?   

Personally I would stick with an S&P 500 no-fee ETF until you have more money saved.; META, best fundamentally, but always a scandal away from -40% drawdowns; SMCI; Dump TSLA immediately; GOOG - with the antitrust suit, looming sell off of Chrome, and overall continuing trend of de-Googling from some of their online services, I would avoid their stock.; Costco; Look at Reddit it’s at its predicted price, but I have a feeling it’s going to be parallel. What made up pretty soon.; No debate. Micron.; all of these are top tier.  micron is definitely smaller but I own them, so I'm probably impartial.  lol; [deleted]; Probably microsoft because it’s the worst mag 7.  It grows slow and its PE ratio of 36 is pretty ridiculous compared to the others. I would never buy microsoft because I would always consider at least google, meta, amazon, or nvidia over it.; MU; Tesla. It's expensive and much of the speculation is based on the idea of political influence, not the strength of the underlying business.; I wouldn’t touch TSLA. It’s a casino at this point. You’ll probably see it go higher but who knows how much higher?

Someone’s going to be left holding the bag and it’s not going to be pretty. You’re better off putting money in companies that aren’t so overpurchased.; Hey what r u doing with my portfolio!; Tesla and Walmart. Tesla makes no sense from a value perspective unless the robotaxi works out (which seems very far away esp compared to waymo) and Walmart pays employees so little that they often rely on gov assistance/programs. I don't support that business model; I’d avoid COST, trading at a valuation higher than NVDA and it’s a warehouse club. 

Incredible company, but come on. That’s one to buy on a deep, multi-month market correction though.; Just buy an etf; All good stocks. But I'd increase shares in Google & Tesla and sell Meta.; MU personally, its projections have gone down a lot over the past year; Tesla, but only because I think the CEO is a massive sack of shit and I hope the company crashes; META, TSLA, APPL - they are too influenced by media and brand fans; I personally avoid apple, just because their revenues have capped off the last couple years. And I avoid Tesla, for obvious reasons. Of the rest, there are a couple I'm not familiar with, so I don't go into them, I don't do Walmart because I think my money would just be better in Costco.; It depends on your strategy, but if you aim to hold these long-term and want good diversification, I would recommend theses:

Amazon
Google
Mastercard
Costco
Dollarama (a suggestion, as I believe you’re in Canada)


You don’t need to monitor them frequently—just set price targets and buy at favorable prices.; Tesla all the way..that company is propped up by hype and manipulation; Walmart; NET and GOOGL; [removed]; MU and CostCo. Holding MU now. Sold Cost 2 months ago.   MU CEO is a let down, stock trades in range of 90 - 110 and they are selling commodity and tied to PC. You want an AI play, go NVDA.  MU is SanDisk 2.0.  Cost is ok but trades at a premium. Pick 1, WMT or COST... Good luck!; They’re all pretty good. I think Walmart did the worst of all of them this past year.; Idk what is happening with wmt; MU. biggest dissapointment of a stock. Never performs. It sounds great on paper but it always underperforms; TSLA easily - as others have said it is beyond overvalued, margins have been compressing over time and it is just bid up due to Elon. It’s the closest thing to a true dotcom bubble ready to burst we have in this market.; all of them right now. Time to go cash; Easy.  Micron; MSFT, COST; I would avoid MU.; I see tesla has been mentioned, and so has costco.

I personally think apple has about 10 more good years. It's definitely a fringe perspective. As a brand, they were built on innovation and performance dominance.. they have neither now and are clinging to a perception of being elite. I feel it will be figured out, and people will trend back towards performance and innovation. 

P.s. this is just my perspective, not a recommendation. Always keep in mind that the stockmarket is legal betting, and you are betting on investors' perception of a company and not the companies true value (i.e. tesla); TESLA - dumpster fire waiting to happen lol. And we all know it, even those holding it for dear life lol; Costco. Sell that shit.; TSLA, because Elon is crazy. He is alienating his base customers. It is also way over priced now. No way Trump can help the company that much. They are not the only one in the robot taxi business waiting for regulation change. My money is on waymo because it is easier to modify cars into robot taxi than making new cars.

Costco & Walmart: Tarrif may hit retail. Too risky until we know what kind of tariff we will get.; NET; Tesla at this price for sure!!!; TESLA; AUR is a great stock and company.  Watch the Working docuseries on Netflix to learn more about the company.; All of em; APPL is a loser in my book; All of these are bangin, can’t go wrong, I’m a holder in most of these myself… I suspect they’ll keep goin up until the bubble pops; TSLA; All!

Bitcoin only; MU is a cyclical stock. Check the draw downs in the past. It has data centre revenue going for it I guess.

But still have a review; You hold S&P500 in addition to stocks. This indicates you don't have a concise strategy. Imo, EITHER, hold S&p500 or do stock picking. Only pick stocks if you are willing to put considerable time into research.

Personally i just ride thr s&p500.; meta, wallmart, google, amazon, and tesla.; AMZN is headed for some serious trouble IMHO. They’ve actually reached the point where they screw over vendors so much that a whole lot are simply throwing in the towel and are working hard to make the customer experience untenable.; buy Nio
easy 10$ soon ; Nancy pelosi sold half of her Microsoft stock - rumour is Microsoft will be forced to split part of its business off; theyre just companies

company going downhill? avoid it. company just staying afloat? avoid it.

Stick to something like Tesla with very high prospects and low potential for consistent failure; TSLA doesn't have fundamentals. The P/E ratio is insane, it has incredible competition and no growth strategy. It's all based on Elon hype. 

I won't short it because stupid keeps it propped up. But it'll eventually fall. 

Toyota is a better car company and Waymo is a better AI company.; This is the realest answer by far.; I own both and approve this message.; Tesla is losing steam everywhere. Liberals hate musk and don't want his car, EU as well. China is catching up and sell their own cars; Also, I work in IT and their automated driving systems (visual) seems bad conceptually compared to the other prevalent system (LIDAR); Meta since they are not inventing, but monetizing by copying.

Tesla since Elon have lost it. 

Amazon, since its to big and diversified for its own good. And cloud will grow only so far.; So you're telling me they're due...; Costco has always been expensive. I remember not buying it under 300 because it was ""expensive.""

It's certainly not something to take a huge position in due to that downside risk, but slowing building a position is fine.; When Nvidia reissued their stock I was kind of expecting other companies like CostCo, Netflix, and Meta to do something similiar.

It is weird to me that they haven't, young people who might want to get into investing are going to have a hard time owning 1 stock in something and it being 15-20% of their entire portfolio. There is a psychological barrier to entry there that I wonder if it is having some kind of cooling effect on trade.; Just used my costo card for the first time. 2 of 3 food items spoiled. My little anecdote.; Yes all these are good but tesla depending on his goals; extremely volatile; Many feel that owning Tesla stock puts them in the ""I am virtuous"" camp (I know this is not what you mean by principles).  But the virtue depends on what state and county you live in, and what resulting percentage of the power grid has its power generated by burning something.  If you are a Tesla owner in West Virginia and do not have solar, you are mistaken that you are helping the environment by having a BEV.  Coal fired power plants dominate there.  If you are in Eastern MA, then 52% of electricity is generated by burning something, and 6% of that comes from burning trash (they actually do that).; why is that; Just ask Rex Tillerson; Worst advice ever; thanks! would you say now is a good time to buy everything? or does it seem like the market will crash? (not everything on that list, still narrowing it down a little); Sounds like you're emotional.; The word on the street is that unhedged always wins in the long run. I buy unhedged whenever I can, but sometimes it’s unavoidable like the CDRs OP is holding.; avoid or invest? and why?; wealthsimple; OP, I should prolly change them for US stocks instead then, better than paying the fees long term; I would say that because they are coming up with newer innovations besides facebook. They own instagram, and they recently created those AI glasses.  I’m sure there will be many more inventions to come from them. But which of my stocks do you hold if u don’t mind me asking; not asking reddit to pick stocks. Asking which I should avoid, if there’s anything in particular i’ve missed about the stock; You know that the antitrust is incredibly unlikely to actually hit earnings and funda right? Chrome sell off is not insignificant but not enough to be bearish. Please explain your de-googling line can't understand it. I'm not gonna quote quantum or ""AI leader"" as catalysts for growth bc I remember the quantum computing bull run during COVID. Companies like that only rocket during times of easy money, bubbles, and low interest rates. AI will be just as commoditised and available as the internet is today. AI capex is important, but being a leader is irrelevant as it will become as commonplace as a desktop in the future. However, Google already has a platform that people constantly use and they can use their reach to pitch their AI search, too. They have all your data and they do have a valid AI use case and still a bull case is more than viable.; 🤔 please elaborate; Stock splits don't have a material impact on the company or its stock fundamentally. There are just more shares.; ""It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price""; then there’s this guy😭😭😂; thanks!; i’ve heard this one? Because of their debt? their performance looks decent tho.; looks like a pretty safe investment imo tho?; Bet. Have you heard of TCS?; hahahah never. Crypto isn’t going anywhere; the ETF doesn’t bring in the best returns though. A little slow. this is why i did both. However it is safe obviously; That's a fundamentally flawed mentality.

The S&P 500 (and most mutual funds or index's) were created for instant diversification and also to adjust varying risk tolerances. Owning stocks and index's is what lots of people do, me included.

The reason? I have 60% of my portfolio in index's as a risk tolerance safety net when (not if) the market goes down, the other 40% is individual stock picks. Why do I do this? Well to give perspective S&P YTD as of this post is up 27.23%, my portfolio itself is up 54.83% YTD (thanks 2024 blue chips!).

To sum up, having 100% in S&P 500 is not bad at all if you're a new or ""lazy"" investor, but neither is owning S&P 500 and some stocks inside of the S&P 500. Both are good choices. It's not wise to just buy S&P 500 and say ""Oh well, now the 500 stocks in there are off limits"" however, it makes no sense as an investor to do that.; invest? or avoid; I literally bought all 5 of these today while the Canadian market was closed. 🙈; Third party seller services are about 20% of amazons revenue-even if half of them threw in the towel Amazon would be fairly untouched; would you say now is a good time to invest? I’m wanting to put money into stocks but market seems to decline??; You’re down -80% and wanted exit liquidity. 

Nice try.; Lol; I don’t know who the CEO of Toyota is and I like it that way.; All depends on your investment philosophy. 

If it’s value investing, sure, I agree with everything you said.

If it’s yolo investing, 

Or bear with me, investing to get yolo investors (aka momentum investing), TSLA might be a fine choice, even if it’s not my choice.; Zeekr; Yup, Tesla is used for swing trading nothing more. Literally nothing they do is leading.; It does have a growth strategy, fully autonomous vehicles/robotaxis. I severely doubt they could get it to work any time soon so I'm shorting it; You probably bought dell when apple was out too.; xD comical; You're sleeping; No growth strategy? Are you a real person?; I mean I could see you thinking it is very highly valued but overvalued is a judgement call that cannot be reduced down to high price vs current earnings.

No fundamentals it has grown cash flows consistently for many years at profit margins well above the rest of the industry.

And no growth opportunities?  I see more teslas on the road each year and they continue to try to land full self driving which seems like a big growth opportunity.

Not a new buyer or owner here but also just think this dogmatic kind of valuation is pretty thin and kind of just comes across as one of those people who hates Elon.  Which is fine but I try to keep emotion from my finances; You have no idea what you are talking about; Wow! Tesla is my biggest position and has provided financial freedom. WILL BUY more shares if a decent pull back occurs.; Isnt MU doing horrible tho?; Big fan of MRVL? What do you think price target will be 3-5 years from now, and why?; You should drive one, Tesla is ahead of the game.; Have you tried it?  Tesla automated driving is quite good now.  It has improved significantly, even over the past year.

I felt the same thing; extra sensors sounded like a great advantage over vision alone.  But functionally, Tesla's vision-only system is quite good.  And Tesla's system is more flexible than other systems that rely heavily on high-resolution mapping.; Worst advice ever; THATS THE ATTITUDE; Yeah can’t knock the company just doesn’t fit my investing style. Let’s say eps growth is 10% for the next decade. Imo you’re still likely to have well below market returns. 

Forward p/e is like 52-53ish. Average p/e for Costco while expensive is let’s say 35. A slight revision to the mean takes away all returns and it’s not a big dividend payer. And that’s just saying it comes back a little bit towards the average. What if it goes all the way back to average, what about lower? Then you have a downright terrible holding despite it growing the whole time.

A company with the reliability and track record of Costco deserves a premium no doubt but that much? The odds of it staying there indefinitely are so low.; Costco will continue at a premium because of incoming inflation and the expectation that will drive record sales for them.; I’m not talking about share price, but rather price to earnings ratio; Off topic, but you can return it for a refund.

Companies aren’t fully judged by customers on their ability to serve without error, but also how well they are able to correct any issue.; Stock picking is extremely risky compared to index fund investing; More exposure. 

What I found helped me was buying s&p500 and small cap etf. DCA that.

And on the side. Purchase sector/niche etf. Eg, semiconductor, uranium, solar, oil/gas

I didn’t have to worry about the individual companies, I traded the market segment and not the company; A) Time in the market beats timing the market.  As a retail investor, go for the long(er) run. 

B) If I had the answer on what to buy and when, I would be a billionaire. 

C) I bought $NVDA in 2009 and sold it in 2010. Up 70,000% since.  That tells you how much I can predict the future.; Why is it unavoidable?; Specifically and mainly because Walmarts are closing and Costco is related to or with Walmart (without specifics cause of time right now) and they're closing to basically turn into processing centers. The original owner (and it's still in the same family line) comes from a family of eugenists that basically had the same business model that Walmart does now. (In short) This is why I would avoid them; Nothing wrong with those CDRs in my opinion. Yes, they have some fees attached to them but I have a few of them in my portfolio and have been happy with it. 

The alternative is paying fees for USD FX. As I’m sure you know, the CAD is down big. I do believe it’ll eventually even out a bit. Might be a few years but it’s always something to think about.; Goog MSFT (for more than 12 years so I have done okay) AMZN (also have had for a while) I had Wal Mart for a while but sold it a while back.  I am looking for some nor tech stocks maybe ones that aren’t as well know by Main st.  Have bought a couple and hope they are the grand slam like the ones you noted; Meant to say more tech stocks not nor tech stocks.  Sorry about that.  I guess I have Fat fingers; Well, if you're just starting out, it might be wise to reduce exposure to high-volatility stocks like $TSLA and shift focus to steadier earners like $WMT and $COST for better risk balance 🤔; Betting on a dream. Better competitors. Dump MU and run.; [removed]; This is Cloudflare; Apple isn’t a loser but they’re too expensive for what they are.; I suggest you take the time to learn. do not take random mambo jumbo from people who didn’t put the time to educate themselves. 

This is the same reaction people had when email started, I still remember the last guy in the industry that insisted he’s sticking to using a fax machine. 

I don’t think his business is still around anymore. 

I’m not saying go buy, I’m saying is to spend 6-7 hours to start learning. Then make the decision from a point of knowledge not rumors; What he said is incorrect.  By owning a combination of the two you expose yourself to the consistent return of the market while overweighting yourself in stocks you’re more confident on and hoping to outperform based on those.; Meta will be around for the next 40 yrs and outperform sp500. Buy just that; why walmart, i get its overpriced but isn’t it great long term. And why meta bad; avoid.; they beat all production target numbers not priced in yet ; I’ve always said I have never once heard about the CEO of Costco and it shows.; I think when you are a boss of a company you should know how it all works not that you just bought it cuz ur rich. Toyota ceo loves cars and can drift, used to repair and race cars; He is brilliant; It was Mr. Toyoda but I think he retired in April.; At the same time, everyone knows who the CEOs of Apple and Amazon are & those are incredible companies.; Zeekr is sick. I wish we weren’t escalating tensions with China so we could get some of them over here. $GELFY; Tell that to the people who bought a few years ago and have seen it double several times.; Buy some GOOG then to get the Waymo exposure.; You will live to regret that. Don’t bet against Elon😏; Theyre a real regarded person, thats for sure. They only know their politics tell them he's against their religion so he's evil. They cannot think critically about tesla. Its impossible for them. No advantage? Jesus fucking christ. RemindMe! 3 years; On top of it all, it has multiple verticals as well as the brand and manufacturing infrastructure to build and integrate them all under one thing. They literally have 0 competitors who can operate on their level, and that’s not opinion - numerous CEOs have been outspoken in saying what Elon has been capable of, no one else can do. Jensen Huang is plowing money into Tesla, and legacy automakers are failing left and right to develop and successfully deploy comparable products profitably.

I’m an Elon maximalist, yes, but that’s because I’ve done an extensive amount of digging and can’t find anything to the contrary. TSLA is so damn high because each of its businesses is rapidly dominating and becoming profitable. The stock price is a result of institutions plowing money in because they understand the vision and advantage Tesla has.

But then you have people on Reddit whose knowledge comes from…idk the hole in their ass?; Tesla all the way, all who are doubting Tesla because they dislike him. Need to detach themselves from their feelings & realise that it’s not just a car company, do your research. If not I can assure you will regret not jumping on the train 5-10years from now. Wake up the world we live in is changing & changing fast. Exponentially to be precise, then again it is said that the human brain finds it hard to understand exponential growth. This is not a dig on anyone it’s just facts; Most analysts like it in the longer term.; hasn’t made progress just horizontal movement; Zack’s has it at a 34% long term growth rate, but only a $120 12mo price target. It’s had a big run, so I’m guessing it flattens out for a bit before another AI fueled run.; Compared to companies like Waymo is seriously doubt it. Tesla is a company thats very much in your face with marketing but then underdelivers.; Admittedly I haven't. I can imagine it works great in good weather conditions. In theory, in bad weather (fog/heavy rain/snow) LiDAR should work much better.; Why even invest if you are making decisions based on emotions lmao; Why even invest if you are making decisions based on emotions lmao; Do you have degrees from uc berkeley and ucla, and grew up in silicon valley?; I agree. That's why I only have a small portion unless it does dip dramatically. At the end of the day, they're a grocery store and shouldn't demand such a high P/E. But it is well run.; Thank you costco guy; More risk more reward; I wouldn’t say stock picking is “extremely” risky. But it is riskier than index funds I agree. Just stick to large cap or blue chip stocks and you should be good for the most part.; i’m thinking of going for small cap etf for a big chunk of my 40% small cap investing strategy for sure. then for large cap  investing in maybe 7 or more companies. not sure what you mean in investing in individual companies, don’t you need to invest in a company which is in your energy sector for ex? or do you mean you just know those sectors will always do good long term no matter which company you put your money in; for “A” your saying i should just buy now then? I’ve heard this saying before. I agree because prices will always go up. But i never hear them say this about crypto; Some ETFs and these CDRs only offer hedged versions. Therefore if you want those ETFs or CDRs, the hedging is unavoidable.; How is Costco related to or with Walmart?; What do you think I should do. i’m not sure too much of the difference between both. I’m a canadian citizen. or which would you recommend to hold in cdr and why? i think it’s better to change what i have into usd currency. better than paying an annual fee on the CDR. I think it’s prolly better to pay the buy and sell exchange fees especially when the USD will outperform CAD.; both way too overpriced. I have them in mind just waiting till their P/e ratio decreased or price decreased; bros username is also KULR; is it a safe buy? i heard they have debt or something relating to expenses/debt ?; Prospect for future growth? The brand is not dead but it's definitely not growing. Even Buffett thinks so.; been in crypto since 2020. Hasn’t made the progress I’ve wanted it to. Stocks are definitely better off for retirement and long term growth. Stocks you can always build off of with small amount of capital. But crypto needs a big investment to see growth to start off with (for those less risky cryptos).; Yeah I thought so too. I’ve heard many people do this and invest in several ETF’s both holding the same stocks too for ex. Just diff strategies in each, and holding %.; They still think having thousands of quick swap batteries lying around not being used in storage is a good idea.; He’s good.; Amds ceo is super; Probably because it changes all the time; Lol what? Tesla didn’t have a single product when Elon bought it. He was deeply involved not only in the car design, but the construction and tuning of the factories and assembly lines. This is like 5 minutes worth of Googling.; More like forced because nobody believed in his vision to stick to hybrid only...and now they are like "" maybe he was on to something...""; The stocks doing pretty well and has given me pretty good gains! I see it being $90+ this year; I have already lol, I'm down bad. Still think my bet was correct, it's just going to take a long time to realize it; Yeah, I can't stand the guy but the path ahead is clear and almost guaranteed.; So, I'm an auto industry analyst and you're talking out of your ass. There are multiple manufacturers that are 12-18 months out from eating Elon's lunch. Tesla's tech is indisputably good, but they have proven time and time again that they simply cannot produce a car that has the level of market appeal that we see from Toyota or Honda. Quality consistently takes a shit when they scale. Hyundai, Kia, Volvo, and MB are all making a much better car with quality tech and have more capability to scale--all without mentioning that Musk is incredibly polarizing.

You've got Chinese manufacturers sitting in the shadows waiting for an opportunity to destroy everyone and Rivian/Polestar have a growing presence in the niche corners of the domestic market.

Tesla is a fucking meme and, IMO, a gamble. Bound to blow up the second Musk loses his proximity to the White House and the government's money cannon. Space X and Star Link are more akin to arms manufacturers insofar as their viability is wholly contingent on government contracts.; Quality is in the hole for Tesla, they keep moving the goal posts for self-driving cars/taxi service, which I get you have to sometimes push things back, but at some point you're just failing to deliver on promises, way better battery tech coming from other venues where Tesla was admittedly at the forefront at one point, other EVs have caught up to Tesla, and to top it off their CEO is shitposting non-stop on his social media site and driving a lot of potential customers to other companies. Trying to be a realist, there's money to be made in the company no doubt, particularly given his legion of fanboys such as yourself and his current close relationship with the incoming admin, but the company now is not the same as they were 5 or so years ago.; They seem to have a lot of partnerships. Not sure exactly how much longterm growth, maybe $200 a share 3 years out?; Exactly, stop catching feeling😩; Nicks a coward; It’s currently a stock pickers market.; I’m bias here. Fidelity has a nice fund and etf selector tool. I’ll browse the different themes, check out the ETFs, look at the performance, allocation, and expense ratio.

From there I make my picks based on what I know in the industry and market.

I like tech and pharma.

I came from telecom snd there is a big gov funding to get 5G and fiber internet to pretty much everywhere in the USA. Even the small fish have access to the capital. So I’ve been buying.; A)  as part A 

I am saying don't try to time the market unless you really know what you are doing.  Stay away from meme stocks as they are often pump and dump. 

Price will go up, unless they go down. 
Do your research on what you want to buy. 

Crypto is purely speculative, there is no tangible assets behind it.  You can make money,  or not.   Your call.; “Without specifics cause of time”
Is the new google it!; I mean, the FX fee is usually 2.5% each way, and the fee on the CDR is only about 0.5%, plus it offers hedging (if that’s your thing). 

I don’t really have advice for you (nor am I qualified to give advice) besides telling you that I own plenty of companies and ETFs in USD, and also have a handful of these CDRs. 

For the companies that offer CDRs, I buy those. Otherwise I’ll buy in USD.; Keep in mind maybe that Costco has seen success internationally too. I personally live close to a non-US Costco and dude, that building is packed. Maybe factor in some foreign growth?; [removed]; Speculative, serverless edge computing; [deleted]; Apple AI, healthcare services (eg airpod hearing aid breakthrough), widely growing software service division, and still strong hardware sales to boot. 

This is a pretty delusional take tbh, considering they've outgrown the SnP in YTD, YOY, and 5Y periods (and 10yr, 15yr, etc). Buffet trimmed because Berk was way overweight on Apple, and had a favorable tax opportunity pre-election w/ democrats expected to increase LT cap gains tax. Last part ultimately didn't pan out but both those reasons are more accurate than ""wasn't growing anymore"", which is just categorically nonsense.; Been in crypto to me means that you traded some shit coins and other tokens. I wouldn’t. And I seriously think that you underestimate how big bitcoin will get. (I don’t really care about the other coins, whatever multiples I’ll make of those I’ll exchange to Bitcoin.)

Those that will hold even a fraction of Bitcoin will do very well. Just my thoughts. 

Best of luck; Keep 50% or more as a core in the broad index funds. Then you can go nibble at other stocks. 

It at least gives you a chance at outperforming. You could underperform as well, but at least you're anchored by the core funds.

If you find a small cap that 10x's over several years, and you have 5 to 10% in it, you've significantly outperformed. If it goes to 0, you moderately underperform.

Just need to know what you're doing and not buy based on hype and fomo; they did millions of swaps. 
swap in under 3 minutes. 
many regions in china only have 1 phase power not 3 phase so swaping still is needed for some ; Costco has had 3 CEOs over 40 years, the entire life of the company, so that's a lie.; You can always order a box of pliers from Costco to remove your foot from your mouth.

!RemindMe 10 years; 🤣; First Google result “Tesla was founded in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors. Its name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, Elon Musk joined as Tesla’s largest shareholder; in 2008, he was named chief executive officer”. He literally bought into it. Stop licking elons ass now. Also I never mentioned Tesla once yet you came to a conclusion it’s about Tesla. There are thousands of manufacturers who bought the companies. Maytag appliances was one of the best and they were bought by whirlpool which turned them into basic ass appliances.; That’s what I’m saying. I don’t have to agree with Elon on fucking politics to know that they have a massive data advantage in the AI world. I cannot name a single other company who has a moat as deep as Tesla when it comes to their specific use case for AI. Not one. The headstart with economical bots that are scalable and the massive unparalleled super computers both Tesla and XAi have make them a force to be reckoned with. Comparing them to a car company and saying “BuT mUh P/e RaTiO hErDuRhUr” is next level regarded. Elon’s fight with Biden and him getting revenge is irrelevant.; Yeah auto industry analysts have been saying this for 12 years now.

My family friend is an OEM for legacy auto and they have been saying the same thing for years now.

The problem with being an industry analyst is while you become a specialist on comparing a Ford to a GM, you will miss the bigger picture because of how much you have married yourself to legacy auto.

Willing to eat my shoe if there is a legacy auto player who has a better selling EV than a Tesla in the US by year end.; The infighting has already started and the inauguration hasn't even happened yet 😂🍿; I read some of your reviews and our 12 year old daughter is months away from surpassing your work quality; Agreed.  And maybe it corrects downward.  

I was just trying to steel man a case for why it might correct upward and that markets are pretty good at pricing things that it is not so cut and dry.

Had to pipe up when one dude on Reddit saying it’s P/E is high and that they dislike Elon and that is the extent of their valuation.

Lots of headwinds.  Others may catch up but they have proven unable to.  My assumption is because they have long supply chains and are all positioned around internal combustion and their talent is not tech based.  But I must say have you ever sat in a Tesla and had it drive you around?  It’s not all vaporware.; Okay i see what you mean. Stock prices now are extremely many at ATH, I do suspect them to go down at one point soon, it’s just a matter if i’m willing to wait 6 months to buy at the low peak of the arch. A recovery in the stocks seems to take a year (at-least with the last recession). Regardless it’ll go up at the end of the day; But I wanna know now 😠 na jk I’m guessing b/c of their competition with sams club?; aren’t they all😭; shit goes vertically up. Don’t expect it to keep going. Volatile af; Wasn’t that crowd strike??; Choose words carefully, delusional? If the company was continuing to grow earnings why would he have sold? Growth has slowed in China and let's see what happens with Tariffs. 

All the while, if you don't have an iPhone now, chances are you're not going to apple watch nor air pod. It seems the market is quite saturated with overpriced electronics. Better growth elsewhere in the AI trade, such as energy and in GaN semiconductors.; They have got no revenue growth, and they are priced like they should have been 10 years ago. 40+ p/e, in my books, requires 10%+ growth per annum over a decade. No doubt Apple still has prospects and a little bit more room to go, but people (including myself) believe it is too richly valued and we advise the OP to stay away and pick companies with larger margins of safety. That's all. Ofc you could still outperform if all your bullishness is accurate. Cheers!; Apple is growing, not fast enough to justify their PE; Unless you’re holding a full bitcoin, you wont make the safe ROI as you would with stocks in 10 yrs for example. Bitcoin has gotten too expensive. I’m not saying you can’t make money on Crypto, but it sure is very difficult to work with the market analysis. It takes people years to learn it, and certainly is not easy. This is why many people prefer stocks as for the majority of the part your stocks will always rise. That’s not the case for crypto, as you will need to know when to buy and sell to make your profits.

|-|-|-|-|; Lol are you illiterate? You didn’t read my comment or your research.

Elon bought into the company - nobody is arguing that. But the company had nothing but a name at that point. Everything after that point was him. That original company didn’t have plans for 5 cars, a tractor trailer, home solar/energy, and robotics.

Seriously you’re just low IQ.; [deleted]; I think Tesla's long-term viability and it's stock performance are totally separate conversations--it's clear that the stock price is astronomically high for an auto manufacturer for a while. We've (myself included) have historically hand waved it because there was some semblance of the valuation that was based on the fact that they're a disruptor and people want in on a newly popular technology. I think we've crossed the threshold into meme status, as is evident by the price surging and falling as a result of Musk's public stunts.

As for traditional OEMs? They're doing a lot wrong and I'm hardly viewing this through that lens. Tesla's success for the last decade has been built on being an aspirational, disruptive (tech and design), fun company with a CEO that people viewed as funny and/or quirky. Here we sit in 2024; they've not really updated their design language since the launch of the Model S in 2012, it's not aspirational compared to Rivian, Porsche, or PoleStar, and the very public CEO is deeply disliked by a large portion of the most likely customer base. Momentum? They do have some of that, but they're a smaller percentage of the overall EV space than they were a year ago. Rivian and Polestar have launched highly successful models, Porsche and VW are refining tech, GM is the second largest EV manufacturer despite Tesla having a decade + headstart. BYD is already larger than Tesla internationally. Tesla have already seen their market share erode through 2025 and the trend seems to be accelerating when you look at actual data. Any growth they had in 2024 was strictly a mechanism of lowering prices and the overall EV market growing.

Their only real opportunity to gain that market share back is to either hope that the CyberTruck stops being such a joke or to continue vertically integrating until they become the default budget option. There is only going to continue to be more competition in the space as the overall share of EVs reaches that 10% threshold.

So tell me, what do you base your assumption on other than vibes and a dying trend? Hell, novel and verifiably correct information would honestly only benefit be as my ability to provide my customers with the most accurate information is my sole concern in the vertical. I’ve backed Tesla’s model many times in the past, but outside of the used market, I don’t have a favorable outlook beyond the next few years.; Let’s hear your analysis on the brand and where it sits in the market…; Yeah, I'm just saying foreign Costco is just as popular as US Costco so they  have an identical bull thesis internationally which you could be able to use to rationalise the price.; Just saying foreign Costco is just as popular as US Costco so you could extend the runway and bull thesis to justify the valuation; [removed]; My bad. Too early; I just told you why he sold, you either ignored it or can't read. 

What makes you think Apple has increased political risk relative to other tech giants that run supply chain through SE Asia (almost all of them)? Why are you citing hardware concerns when the business model has clearly focused on a shift to software over the past five+ years? Why would Apple not be considered a serious AI play with their Apple Silicon division, strong fab partners, and large ecosystem for deployment?

Maybe delusional was harsh, but you definitely have no idea what you're talking about if you think Apple is poorly positioned right now.; They’ve beat revenue estimates four earnings reports in a row and have had 10% total rev growth across last two quarters, so no idea where you got that from. Not seeing how the PE point is valid for OPs watchlist when half the companies listed have a higher PE than Apple, and less historical upside. 

If you’re bearish on Apple, you’re just bearish on tech. They aren’t trading particularly forward and historically they’re one of the safest high-growth tech stocks ever. ; Not really, they’re pretty in line with other tech giants in terms of PE, and certainly not the worst offender on OPs list. If you’re going to argue apple trades too forward, then most (and nearly all tech) companies are trading too forward right now.; The fact you think bitcoin is too expensive makes me believe that you seriously underestimate where this is going. That’s ok too; Hahahah, perhaps they have seen many iterations of Costco come and go. Only 2 things have been constant, the hot dog deal and rotisserie chicken prices; StopHesAlreadyDead.gif; Yet again the first link off of Google “Martin Eberhard, an American engineer and entrepreneur, was the designer of the first Tesla car, the Roadster”. I mean I get it you love Elon musk but again my comment never mentioned Tesla or Elon musk. I couldn’t care less who invented Tesla and who designed it, I drive a kia stinger, love that car and that’s all I can afford. This is my last comment, I don’t have time or energy to argue with you. Take your own suggestion now and read my first comment again Mr literate person.; Lmao @ inferior sensors. See you in a few years. I’m sure you won’t block once you realize this shit aged like milk.; Hand wave things which you don’t understand; Rivian and Polestar outsell Tesla in revenue over the next 5 years?; pure meme stock. remember me when it crashes; Apple, the only thing saving apple is it's balance sheet. There's little innovative since Jobs died. What happened to the self driving apple car? Project was scrapped. Where's the growth? 8% projected for next year.. big whoop. Is apple now a value stock?; Other tech giants have more growth prospects; I’m not underestimating it. Bitcoin is almost at 100k usd…. Meaning that you will need to invest in a big chunk of a bitcoin to see some nice returns. Not everyone can afford a big chunk like 20k into one coin. Would rather diversify into stocks not only to diversify the risk, but also because they are safer. I get you’re a big Bitcoin fan, and I get where you’re coming from, but your honesty can’t just ignore all other investment opportunities. I understand that bitcoin could be the next future currency though. Doesn’t hurt to consider stocks…; Those hot dogs fuck so hard.; Rip - could delete but I own my own mistakes.; Polestar feels unlikely to me, but that is with little real understanding of their offerings or business. Rivian is only one of them I could see doing it if they’re able to get the price of the R2 down to something more palatable and if they’re able to able maintain good financials and pay down their seed money.
They will, however, continue to erode Teslas market share. 5 years is a long way off in tech-time any this corner of the industry is evolving fast.; [removed]; >There's little innovative since Jobs died

Apple stock was $12 when Jobs died (up 2000% since). Not to discredit the foundation he laid, but you'd have a hard time finding a finance professional who doesn't approve of Cook as CEO. Hard to take you seriously when your arguments are so goofy and uninformed.; If you don't care to elaborate on that we can just agree to disagree; I’m not saying get all your money and put it in bitcoin, what I’m suggesting is to slowly get off zero. I think most people lack of understanding to what multiples bitcoin is going to get to is what holds them back.; I’d bet my left nut they don’t.  5 years is a short time when it comes to scaling out auto production and getting new annual buyers.; I get their good for what they are, but just like apple, it has become more of a trend which substantially drove the price up more than what they’re actually worth.; Bro, Apple has had no revenue growth for years and it's currently given a 38 fwd P/E.

It's way overvalued. Case closed. Out of the mag 7, it and TSLA are trash at these levels.; Apple’s AI push is to get people to buy the IPhone which has seen flattening sales.  So they’ve sunk billions in Capex (lowering FCF) to attain this AI and it will most likely not succeed in driving iPhone sales higher and is likely going to be a wasted expense since apple AI sucks.  I’ve never heard someone say it’s useful or better in any way than third party AI.  Again, Apple isn’t bad or going down, they are just not worth the price in my view.  But valuation is by nature subjective so we can indeed agree to disagree.; If you're so adamant about btc being the best option, why not suggest all in..."

[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse); Fuck you. That's how my year went; I beat the benchmark only to get back to where I started thanks to MU; 1000% return this year. Expecting -99% draw down next year.; 60% on 100k investment in august. 50k in an ETF (+10%). Biggest profits are from RKLB, LUNR, RCAT. Only buying shares.; How did you purchase Reddit at 20; 148%. Still red all time. Terrible with timing. Leaps only nowadays; 400%.  All in on PLTR.; 230%

This isn’t normal for me. I aim for 60% per year so this was a knock out year

I did an annual recap/review of my best and worst trades: https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/s/FnYHlILVN7

I know everyone seems to expect next year to be amazing for the market, I have this feeling that it will be a bit underwhelming so I’m keeping myself a little guarded. I def don’t want to go super long on everything and round trip this year’s gains.; ""35% in my portfolio but other sources say 26%""

Found the Canadian 🙂

I'm at 52.87% at the moment. 
Epic year.  I've actually recovered from my 2022 plunge and reached a new all the high.; Nope, got fucked by AMD once again and am bagholding. After a bunch of winning trades I'm maybe up 10%.

I can't complain too much because AMD profits paid a lot of my house down payment and I got in $30 and have round tripped it many times.; 80-120%

It would’ve been like 500% if I hadn’t sold KULR at a buck and RGTI for 7 something 🤢; 58% green for the portfolio average.

Biggest wins:
* NVDA, 135%
* KULR,  105%
* MSTR, 77%
* LUNR, 61%

Loser:
* Advanced Money Destroyer, -25%; U guys have profits?; I’m one of the 1 in 1000 people that didn’t massively beat the S&P this year thanks to overpositioning in a shitty solar stock, I did 10% this year; +80% thanks to NVDA bought at 600ish pre split. Lost some on PARA. All shares.; \+46% YTD mostly on RDDT most of my investment was at $70 but I've been DCAing it up actually; I got a new job in May, paid off my credit card debt in July and was able to invest again in August. Up 86% since August; https://preview.redd.it/25q1n9ore89e1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f6c7b2b8f9388291299a521d5e30b77f09add76c

Up 261% YTD. All options, some bought, some selling for theta. The earliest DTE was 4 months out. Fuck weeklies.; 110% gain 1/3 in Palantir, else Google,Carnival,Amazon, Blackrock; Gotta practice hodling 30% up since oct. 

i’ve sold early too many times already; https://preview.redd.it/vczehnnys89e1.png?width=1279&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06c8d2b036327aabcddff600a31079ab1487d950

Not great, not terrible; won't know how much i lost on regarded trades if i don't calculate it ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882); -45%; I’m bullish on space and satellites. 

I’m currently watching KULR rip past $4 that I sold for 1.20 so I’ll have nightmares for the best couple weeks; Options portfolio: +500% YTD

Stock portfolio: +74% YTD; Up 193.75% as of today. Opened my account in late August. 

Mix of options and stocks. I didn’t have any goals in mind.; +16% overall since 2017, am regarded; Right now, I'm over 50% up YTD. I'm kind of happy, but I'm still down from ATH ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260); Still haven't recovered from 2021; +210% / 52K

Jacked to the tits on RDDT (shares and options); +100% crypto portfolio
+65% ROTH
+75% Options account

Index funds are for suckers; Can we talk about losses? I thought this WSB not Main Street Wins.; 300% up 100k this year; It was a good year! It would've been better if I didn't let 60k shares of RKLB get called away in August but over 200% for the year so no complaining on my end.

After RKLB, I ported LUNR. And I've basically swing traded that and sold some calls along the way. I've got a quarter of my LUNR sold on 16.50 calls that expire next week and I suppose I'll roll them next week and 12k shares left after Christmas Eve and today taking some more profit.

Next year, I hope to find some discount days and go at it again with RKLB and LUNR by my side. I have followed RKLB for years and I didn't think we'd see that runup till Nuetron but they're a beast. I can't be anymore bullish on space and those are my horses. Done great so far.; https://preview.redd.it/zw4w6wh2g99e1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f87e1c1346b430e18fd961f3e490822423dbc8c8

Can’t complain.; +230%. 


Big trades mostly on googl and nvda. Made a good amount on different meme stocks, space stocks, KULR, SOUN. Was a solid year..; 59%, almost entirely from Q4 when I decided to sell my ETFs and start picking stocks (mostly tech).; Bulk is in my 401k:

2022: -26.74%

2023: 31.61%

2024: 37.72%

Brokerage account: Can't figure out how to modify dates but here's what I was able to see:

5/1/2023-12/25/2024- 120.24% (Thanks NVDA); YTD: -5.3%

At 9/30/2024: -57%

It could be worse.  Yes it could be better but hell it could be a lot worse too.; My goal for this year was not to lose as much money as I did last year ($50k). 

I'm currently at -$30k, so success?!

(As a special kind of talent, most of the losses were SPX 0DTE calls. CALLS!!); WMT and NVDA. Buy and hold.; Over 100% in 2024. 43% in 2023.; First year where I really pay attention, redid everything in March.  Stonks only but total portfolio up around 40% and Ive made more than my yearly salary.   Great entries on RKLB, ASTS, PLTR, ARCHR, and LUNR.  All up from about 150-500%.; Up about 28% investing 90% in the S&P 500, and the rest in bitcoin and google. No options.; Great until the grench aka jpow got in tv and I decided to take an edible to sleep which actually made me paranoid and I decided to panic sell premarket after AI flushed.

So basically I'm fucked as usual; Best: mstr shares presplit
Worst: paperhanding crwd shares at the bottom; +42% but I didn't start this year until October so pretty dang good; -5%. I took a year off of day trading.  Didn’t pick it back up until a month and a half ago.  Was down 20% and got my sea legs back.  Just a little out of the loop. I should be at least even by 1/1/25.; NIO killing me but thanks to SOFI up 38% this year but only down 2k as of right now at point was down almost 20k.; first year and i’m up 156.3% thanks you to you idiots. portfolio now worth about $15k. My main strategy was not doing what this community said to do. KULR, RKLB, LUNR 🌘🌑🌒; Scams and fraud are the winners.....; Recovered all the losses from 2022 - 2023 around 50k and then some around 30k. Not much but still I am proud of myself.; Up 135% 
Top 5 gainers: 
RKLB
COIN
INTA
WMT
MRVL; This was my first year investing, I'm currently sitting at like 35% without factoring in time (I make deposits every month so I really don't know how to count that lol), which I am content at; Up 25%![img](emote|t5_2th52|31224). Bought 10k shares Rigetti @ $1.07 and sold @ $1.74. Bought back @ $7.20. Sold Tesla to soon. NVIDIA shares 1200% and cashed out 85k. Tax man eating me next year.  AMD and AMDL destroyed my portfolio.; 486% with how webull calculates it.  386% for normal profit calculation.  Just turned my account green after two years of tragedy.  Just daytrading dogshit topgainer low float penny stocks all year.; Up 38% since May. 50% in stocks, 50% ITM leaps on AMZN, MSFT, AAPL.

I’ve thrown away a couple thousand on random puts on meme stocks. They never hit. ; 326.64%; +720ish % biggest trades were a 6 bagger from VCF, lots of LUNR calls and wheeling shares, and RKLB (wish I held on longer and haven’t traded it since about $10)


The goal was to pay off debt and maybe get a new truck. Still a ways to go and I’m addicted to the thrill so debt will probably get paid off with bonuses while I make my milli. 


Worst trades: lots and lots of selling too early to tinker (sold 200 RCAT shares $5.64, sold 1000 shares of KULR at $1.28, sold 500 RKLB shares at $6.07) BJ wholesale screwed me over during earnings. Actually lots of earnings caused losses and for 2025, I’m not playing earnings. 

2025 plays: 

QQQ to $600 by 3/2025
GSAT to $5 by 4/2025
NOK to $5 by 4/2025
BLND to $6 by 5/2025
LUNR to $50 by 12/2025
Hold onto my shares and stop selling for lotto tickets.; Think mines like 183% YTD and 2000% overall.; +55% green port average.

Winners:

ACHR +81%
LUNR +100%
NVDA +50%
PLTR +50%
RKLB +310%
TSM +50%

Losers:
Advanced Money Destroyer -18%; I have three accounts, all similar sizes.  The one I'm most active in is only up about 5% for the year, because I chased a few biotechs in size after they got some huge approval (PHAT, VKTX, IOVA), and because that's where I tend to play with short-term options because it's an IRA.  Proving I suck. 

My other two accounts which are more buy-and-hold (one because it's taxable, the other because it's at a full-service place where I have to find the phone#and talk to a financial advisor to make a trade, which forces me to be more responsible and thoughtful, not to mention socially outgoing) are each up about 40+% for the year. 

Only one of the three is my go-to for FOMO or dopamine-seeking, and it's the one where I'm underperforming significantly.; Literally every time I look at the stocks I want, they’re like +400% on the month. Then I’m like surely this company with 30 people can’t surge that much more. Then the next month another 400%, I just don’t understand how everyone of these companies are just going bananas. RGTI, RKLB, anything with the name fucking quantum in it.; https://preview.redd.it/qjp9bffnx89e1.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9d90584f51db1d870afc06956af2aa6a7082bc7

Had high hopes for that company at the beginning of the year! Not anymore! Sold my last 100 shares which I had profits. But sold all my contracts at a loss through out the whole year! Thanks to the CEO and his buddies for being greedy! I’ve never seen shit like this before where inside dumps thousands to million shares on a daily basis! Fuck them! I’ll be parking my money with AVGO from now on! Made a shit load of money with AVGO in a short time span!; +54%, started late july, probably +80% if crypto counts, shame i only started with like £4000 but its much better now at least; +106% right now.  Basically just watched my nvidia and fbtc.  Everything else I did was more or less a wash.  All shares, options have taught me I’m always wrong about timing.; https://preview.redd.it/isd2abmm299e1.png?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7e22d7e53adec8c61b60897a8b6fc6e0c60a52e2

did 2 meme options and lost $20 usd ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260); Overall up about 150% ytd, mostly thanks to a great eoy push from AVXL which I’m hoping will 20x in 2025; Up 71%, stocks only. Started my first portfolio 1 month ago, so my YTD is really one month in this case.

AI & Quantum FYI! (I'll probably crash at some point...); Benchmark. Lolz.; Started investing seriously this August, was down 10k at one point, then recovered to being profitable at $18k YTD! Outgained the S&P 500 index!; Up like 300%. Mostly from RKLB. Buying from SPAC, averaged down to ~5$. Then bought some more at 20 after it reached the peak and dipped.; +80% and biggest earners were Nike and HELE earnings puts; https://preview.redd.it/g9egimiia99e1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=34f35eaba4e0a3d7a5d9887900d3e8ef74565dd1

I did kinda well.; 250%; YTD: Down 28% because I bought event contracts for the losing side for the election (can’t mention name coz subreddit rules)

Had to take all my money out in 2023 coz I was unemployed. 

Hopefully 2025 will lead me to make less bad mistakes; https://preview.redd.it/5epwv94zb99e1.jpeg?width=773&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ce7b3826f738bea6fd220bfb50846aa57f608a0

How? 😂 ; Started at $89k. Finished up 93% to $158k. Biggest trades were nvda and pltr; I lost 20%; childlike absorbed innate live worry scandalous bright spectacular weather dependent; 13.29 percent. I got caught in Mullen. But Sound, Archer and BBAI have saved my year. 

Honorable mention to Huma, VOOG, and SCHG.; Transferred my first $1500 12/17/24.  Current Account Value - $2111.89

So what's that \~ 41% percent in 10 days.  I have a feeling it's all downhill from here.

  
 Biggest gains were  
  
$284 on QUBT shares.

$165 current gain value of a HMC 1/17/25 call.  I'm hoping this is going to continue to grow a bit more too

I would like to think I did beat the market this year with \~400% return; Stupid ahh year. Right companies, wrong time.; started the year with 35k.  Pulled 35k out for house down payment, still have 30k left. 

I did alright.; 200% I didn't hear no bell yet either.; 159% in my taxable account. 

Made like 4x or 5x my usual annual income.  I assume next year will wipe that all out so I’m bathing in the glory while it lasts. 

About 44% of that was a large position in RDDT bought on margin Aug 2nd. Meanwhile I set my buy limit like a dollar too low in my retirement account and it didn’t get filled so missed out ugh.; Only 28% 😢; I was up 400% on my gambling account.  Back down to pretty much where I started because I held my long calls through the FOMC announcement like a moron.

My other account, which consists of shares only, is up 130%.; I finally almost broke even on my All time graph 🙏🏽; 78.6% this year.  Discovered I'm very good at buying the bottom, still working on finding the top; https://preview.redd.it/fzglyq70ua9e1.jpeg?width=1206&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af93568cf48a25335d3dae28db3bb30309a9ed62

Mostly NVDA, VOO, MSTR, and META.; Down 12% on the year, but if KULR keeps pumping like this i may very well beat the SP500 anyway. Index funds can suck my dick.; https://preview.redd.it/irnvczydya9e1.jpeg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d86b9082971db78ac5aaefc979ae1d0b47831900

Roth IRA did great. Mostly swing trading TSM, NVDA, and AVGO.

Looking forward to 2025!; +35%

Thank you ASTS. Fuck you DVN.; I shorted nvda through naked calls.  I clawed my way back to even the whole rest of the year.  I literally gave up the day before the top or I would have got all the losses back.  Such a pussy.  The position started manageable when Nadia was at 500, but by the time it hit 1400 it was just too big.; 2022 +51%

2023 +31%

2024 +93% more than half unrealised 

Gains: ubs<nok<gme<qqq<rpi<net 

Loss: aapl, sqqq, uvxy, ezu, tsla, googl; The first and only year I made serious money; funny enough it was from buying TSLA at all time high during 2020-2022.

BA and held until last month!; Around 150 percent on a couple meme boys. And some small cap swings. There’s never a high enough target but I’m ok with it.; Personal +3% - (my picks had terrible returns) only reason I’m green is the ETF’s. 

401k +13.65% - I’ll take it; 73% return averaged between 401k and Roth IRA.  401k is indexed, Roth IRA is nearly 100% PLTR.; I’m up 100%. Mostly TQQQ, FNGU and at the start of the year some cash. Let’s do it again next year with President Elon! 🚀; First green year since I started 5 years ago.  Good news is i was only down 2k since I started,  managed to make 700 back in the last 2 weeks. I could lie and say it's 200k total loss but I made 70k back this year,  just to try and fit in,  but the percentages are the same; +118%; I got 65% return ytd can't complain; https://preview.redd.it/a3vw5dngg89e1.jpeg?width=796&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e1ff725010d7cc4cbcbb8abff787e8a04aed1203; 408% heavy in NVDA and RKLB; Racist

But yes, fuck you it's how it's gonna end.; Where are these tickers, FUCK and YOU, I've been looking everywhere; FUCK MU; I on the other hand was saved by MU. Went all in on INTC when it was at $30. Got hopes up when it went to $35, then was sent to the shadow realm when it went down to $20. Sold majority of Intc when it went back to $26. 

MU saved my ass and got me back to where I started at the beginning of the year. +$1k. 

MU always hovers at around $110 for the past few months. Dips to sub ~$90 but always goes back to $110 range. Just kept buying and selling at ~90 and 110 and made a full recovery.

This new year i wont be a dumbass and will diversify. (RGTI and QBTS here i come); My Roth IRA beat the market 40% to 28%. But my options portfolio is deep in the red. Stocks are so much easier; Best trades?; 100% return on the same above shares + ASTS
 
Only difference I put 10k only.; LUNR I’m liking too; Nice. What are your moves for 2025?; Similar returns for me, good year thanks to TSLA, rddt and RKLB.; Probably a typo; Ya how’s that possible..; Sorry you are right, my avg cost is 70 lol; Yeah, it took me most of the year to finally only buy LEAPS when I'm making a larger investment.  My shorter-term call bets are extremely small now, just enough to scratch the itch.; Get the F out before earnings brother; yeah they say itll be good just to get you to buy while they all sell man; Yeah 60% per year is reasonable. 

I'm only down 25% this year, which is pretty good for me. Mostly because I was PDT locked for about half the year.; lol you got me. that's amazing!; How did you do in 2022 and 2023? Congrats man. 2022 hurt me bad. ; amd was one of my top 3 biggest purchases this past year, down 38%.; 45% of my portfolio is AMD and Intel and they’re both a bit sad; Dude…. Had 220k shares of kulr at a cost average of .239 or something.  Sold when it got to .34 or something and I thought I was hot shit.  Fuck me I’ll never forget about this one; hedge funds be punching the air in this sub rn lol; I sold KULR at $3 and now I’m questioning if I buy back in or just watch from the window; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); Was up 1000% YTD - erased by my MU Yolo last week. 🤣😭 merry Christmas; What drove u towards AMD? I own nvda and crwd but the consumer side is too dicey in my mind; Correction, you’re just the 1 in 1000 that is willing to admit that you didn’t beat the s&p. Whole lot of lurkers keeping super quiet right now. 

Yep we see you all 👀. Time to step into the light so people realize not everyone made bank this year; That’s okay, you tried your best I’m sure and not everyone comes away with a win each year.; Good job! Wishing you another great year in 2025!; Wow that definitely doesn’t look like my chart; bruh that's fckn amazing; I had 1000 shares of IONQ I sold for like $7.50 at a couple hundred buck profit. Turned it into about a grand of crypto gains. Was feeling good and then I saw IONQ share price last week

GUH; Best trades?; Even I’m up more than that and I basically skipped saving for 5 of those years…; This is me

It’s pretty insane feeling; https://preview.redd.it/xvam1heoma9e1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b0a98b43a679a520eceda57fa65cd99ab2d0ff8d

F-ck, I had 30 lots. F-ck; Aren't RGTI and QBTS already too high?; Just holding, dont see any reason to sell. Bullish on everything i hold. Big year for those 3 and ASTS and KULR. Also got some PLTR and RDDT. 

Also coming to wsb for the lulz; Don't think a LEAPS has ever paid off for me.; I hope you meant UP 25%?; I lost 51% in 2022.  It was brutal.  Stayed the course though, no panic selling.

Up about 50% in 2023 also.; I hear ya. AMD got hit by failing to take AI business share from NVDA and over TSMC geopolitical risks especially with the new administration being a wild card, and just generally failing to live up to high PE. But I am stubborn and  cannot accept that I'm wrong that the dominant x86 CPU maker should pump again sooner or later.; Bigdog, thats nightmare shit right there; Could’ve been 10 Lambos.; ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|scream); holy fuck I am sorry; That was me when I sold nflx at 5 dollars. Had doubled my money felt like genius; where did you find out about KULR?; Holy shit dude my heart goes out to you; nah they happy with their 1-2% fee for sure; Buy and it crashes; It has become more and more of a hedge over the year, in case something new and unforeseen happened. I started the year close to 60% NVDA, 40% AMD and paired down AMD more overtime. I was lucky timing-wise, selling the majority around $170. Now my AMD holding is about 5% of my NVDA holding. I wanted to keep some AMD shares just to learn how to sell covered calls, which has been nice to learn. Agree, the consumer side is dicey but interesting, with both AMD CPUs and comically, now Intel GPUs (Intel's latest Arc cards seem to be doing quite well for consumers). I probably won't sell AMD, instead just continuing to sell CCs until I'm back to even.; 100% faith in LUNR. 0% skill; Fuckkk😂; $SNOW netted me about $50k when I bought calls and shares for their earning. Also made a healthy amount on $SPY calls (still ongoing) from when I bought the dip last week, and also $RCAT and $BBAI calls/shares.; rent your mom for a night; Do you think if I got better at writing i would be a better trader?; All these racks gimme aboner

Chivalry is dead; Jesus Christ; Ho Ho Holy shit you belong here, Merry Christmas!; I don't do options, when you gain it's like having a hit all bases on the first date. If you lose, you beg for Vaseline.; They regards; And here I am seething over only buying 100 shares when it was at $7 just to test the waters. Rip


Welcome to clownworld population: 2; They are ripe for dilution, soon it will be water down whiskey. These companies need capital, they'll dilute.; Agreed. I'm gonna look into KULR.  What's your TP for RCAT and RKLB?; No, down. Actually it's -32%. I don't have data from before May when TDA merged with Schwab, but here's the graph since then:

https://preview.redd.it/2jchbevv4c9e1.png?width=1296&format=png&auto=webp&s=98c4d972f201af512ec0b3921da2e850aedff8bc; love that (2023 that is). looks like 2022 sucked for most (i was down 32%) but awesome recovery in 2023 (and 2024!). Happy new year and hopefully another great year ahead!; Keeping tech as a hedge at all is spicy. I should learn CC's w new broker.

I dont see smart CapEX decisions coming from intc or AMD, so a hedge for me is PG. Everybody needs toilet paper.

Whats ur hedge for 2025? Im going for cvna, since cars break and tariffs will wreck new car buys; Wait, I thought you only paid for her services, not buying dinner, breakfast for two + rent of the presidential apartment; possibly.  I could lie and say yes but you made 70k back this year, just to try and fit in, but the percentages are the same.; RKLB 45-50 if everything goes well with Neutron. RCAT 25; Honestly it’s pretty difficult trading with such a small account. I started a $4k challenge portfolio early December and my performance has been lackluster compared to my main account. Up only 2.5% on the month; I like the cvna hedge for those reasons. I think they still have room to run. I'm pretty bad at hedging tbh, I normally end up with a hedge within the same industry as my more focused play and convince myself that's sufficient lol. I've been wanting to find something medical/pharma, but haven't been able to pull the trigger on anything yet. This year my portfolio morphed to AI and Bitcoin waay more than it should be, but I guess I should appreciate its success. I need to shift back to something more balanced though.; i like your mom more, i'll do that with your mom and a few other mums i like even more, my 45k gains ytd should be enough; Why is a bigger account easier? I figured it'd be the opposite.; Pharma i dont touch after buying LLY too high and w new prez coming in

Mstr will sell for gain soon as bcoin hits another high. 2025 im big on crwd and smr. I truly think a cyber event will hit in 2025. Cvna makes sense as a hedge since the price of a fucking car starts at $40k; Because I can make trades on larger stocks. Like buying a call in Costco would be like minimum $2k per contract for an at the money call with 1 month of time left. This gives me much higher probability of profit and not force me to buy either super OTM or low DTE contracts

Also I can sell puts or buy a lot of shares and sell covered calls for income. Collecting premium really does add up. If you look at my annual review post, you’ll see why. I made most of my profit this year in MSTR/MSTU simply selling CSP and CCs. 

These trades are impossible in a $4k acct. Smaller accts inherently must take larger risks to make decent profits.; Ya, that's exactly what has given me pause. My coworker timed LLY really well this year.; Coworker was playing w fire. Health plans will get even more volatile on what they will/wont cover. Medicare reimburse rates will plummet. Etc"
39,Congrats to the new $1B space stock,"
Finally hit a Billy. Been waiting on this for years. $RDW is the Next Space Stock You Need to Watch – Bigger Than $ASTS or $RKLB?

NOTE: tried originally posting this on 10/14, 11/04, and 11/30 and WSB told me I couldn’t because RDW was “under 500m market cap” which is wasn’t … now trading >$10 a share. 

I've been following $RDW (Redwire) for four years now, ever since it IPO’d via a SPAC. I originally owned the stock back at the IPO, sold it before it fully crashed down to $2, and repurchased 10,000 shares at ~$2.50. I’ve bought and sold on the way up and on dips, currently holding 4,500 shares with a cost basis of $3.83. I also hold two call contracts at a $4 strike price expiring in May 2025.

I’m a long-term believer in $RDW and believe it has the potential to be one of the biggest winners in the space industry long term, with significant potential for short-term spikes. This post isn’t about denouncing other space stocks but more about why I believe $RDW can be the winner we all want and need.

NOTE: before diving in, this was originally written on Oct 14, 2024. I’ve since updated this with current numbers as of Nov 30, 2024 





My Portfolio in the Space Sector (Oct 14, 2024):
To show you my broader conviction in space, here’s a quick rundown of my other holdings in the space sector:

-$RKLB: 4,500 shares, 4 call contracts at $2.50 strike, and 2 at $5 strike, expiring in Jan 2026
-$ASTS: 1,000 shares, cost basis ~$12 (sold 2,000 shares at $35 on a pump)
-$LUNR: Sold 5,000 shares and 10 call contracts at $5 on a recent contract pump, sold another 5,000 shares @14.7. 

PORTFOLIO HOLDINGS UPDATE AS OF NOV 30:
-$RDW: 4.500 shares, 2 call contracts at $4 strike expiring May 2025
-$RKLB: 3,100 shares, 2 call contracts at $2.5 strike expiring Jan 2026, 2 call contracts at $7 strike expiring Jan 2027 (Sold 500 @ 15, 500 @ 20, 400 @ 23.5)

Bought:
-$ACHR: 1,000 shares @ $6.18
-$JOBY: 750 shares @ $7.21
-$KULR: 4,000 shares @ $0.55
$GSAT: 2,000 @ $1.89

Sold all of my:
-$ASTS: 1,000 shares @ 30
-$LUNR: 5,000 shares @ 14.7

But my strongest conviction remains with $RDW and here’s why.

$RDW Performance & Key Financials

Redwire has shown strong revenue growth but it’s flying under the radar compared to almost every single one of its peers. Here’s a breakdown of recent financials:

* 2023:
    * Revenue: $243.8 million (+51.9% YoY)
    * Net Loss: $(27.3) million
    * Adjusted EBITDA: $15.3 million

* Q1 2024:
    * Revenue: $87.8 million (+52.4% YoY)

* Q2 2024:
    * Revenue: $78.1 million (+30.0% YoY)
    * Net Loss: $(18.1) million
    * Adjusted EBITDA: $1.6 million

* Full-Year 2024 Guidance:
    * Revenue: $310 million (+27% YoY)

For comparison, here’s how other space stocks stack up:
* $RKLB (Rocket Lab):
    * 2023 
        * Revenue: $244.6 million (+16% YoY)
        * Net loss: $(182.6) million

    * 2023 Revenue: $0
    * Q1 2024 Revenue: $500 thousand
    * Q2 2024 Revenue: $900 thousand

Valuation Insights: Why $RDW is Undervalued

Now, let’s talk about valuation. When looking at revenue versus market cap, $RDW is trading at a much lower multiple than its peers, despite earning more and losing less than almost all of them. This presents a strong case for potential upside if the market starts to recognize its growth.

* $RDW 
    * Market Cap: $524.3M (as of Oct 14 at $7.88/share)
        * As of Nov 30, market cap is now $928.9m
    * Revenue multiple: Just 1.69x revenue
        * As of Nov 30, revenue multiple is 3x
* For comparison:
    * $RKLB: ~10x revenue
        * As of Nov 30, 25x 
    * $ASTS: 100x revenue
    * $LUNR: ~2-2.5x revenue
        * As of Nov 30, 4.5x
* Why This Matters
    * A lower revenue multiple suggests that $RDW is currently undervalued relative to its peers. It’s trading at just 1.69x revenue, compared to $RKLB’s 10x or $SPCE’s 15x, despite immense market traction and success. If Redwire continues on its growth trajectory, this gap in valuation could close quickly, creating a significant upside opportunity.

Proven Track Record

$RDW has been involved in space missions for more than 50 years, supporting missions to practically every planet in our solar system. 
* Sun: 3 missions
* Mercury: 2 missions
* Venus: 3 missions
* Earth: 20 missions
* ISS: 12 missions
* Moon: 4 missions
* Mars: 7 missions
* Asteroids: 3
* Jupiter: 2
* Saturn: 1
* Pluto: 1

Redwire is positioned as a leader in several emerging space technologies that could be game-changers in the next decade. The possibilities here are immense—especially with space-based manufacturing, pharma, and autonomous operations becoming key areas of growth in the sector.

The Opportunity: Why Now is the Time

With everything mentioned above, $RDW presents a major opportunity, but here’s why now could be the time to get in:
* Outstanding shares: 66.54M
* Float: 24.26M (very small compared to peers):
    * $RKLB: 340M
    * $ASTS: 122M
    * $LUNR: 57M
* Short interest: 2.58M shares (10.62% of float)
    * As of Nov 30, short interest is 3M (12% of float)
* Average daily volume: 340k (very low compared to peers):
    * $LUNR: 14.2M
    * $RKLB: 13.1M
    * $ASTS: 16.9M
* Average Daily Volume as of Nov 30: 481k
    * $LUNR: 19.18m
    * $RKLB: 18.52m
    * $ASTS: 12.83m

Low float and low trading volume make $RDW more prone to sharp price movements, especially if the market starts to recognize the value that’s been overlooked. Add to that the upcoming earnings reports and potential contracts in the pipeline, and you have a recipe for significant price action.

Conclusion:
Given $RDW’s impressive revenue growth, proven track record, undervaluation compared to peers, and potential for short-term spikes due to low float and trading volume, this is a stock to keep an eye on. While I hold positions in other space stocks, my conviction in $RDW remains the strongest for long-term growth.
* Past
    * Jan 1, 2024: $2.96 ($196.9m market cap - lower than the 2023 revenue)
    * Oct 14: $7.88 (524.3m market cap)
* Today:
    * Nov 30: $13.96 (928.9m market cap)
* Future Potential?:
    * $20 ($1.33b market cap // 4x 2024 rev)
    * $50 ($3.32b market cap // 10x 2024 rev)
    * $100 ($6.65b market cap // 20x 2024 rev)
    * …you can do the math from here

[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse); Thanks for posting this a year after it went up 452%. ; Excellent DD, I was looking to start a position in a another company in this sector and honestly $RDW seems like a solid pick to pair up with $RKLB.; # **TLDR**

---

**Ticker:** $RDW

**Direction:** 🚀 TO THE MOON!

**Prognosis:**  Buy and HODL.  Calls are also good.

**Author's Position:** Heavily invested (4,500 shares + calls) and VERY bullish.  Made bank already.

**Key Argument:**  RDW is undervalued compared to peers like RKLB and ASTS, despite strong revenue growth and a long history of involvement in space missions (it's been to *every* planet!). Low float and volume mean big potential for short-term price swings.

**Bonus:** OP originally tried posting this months ago, but WSB rejected it because RDW was ""under 500m market cap.""  They were wrong.  *Very* wrong.; KULR is absolutely ripping; Aaaand it just went up 5% 🤣; Own RDW too but in two years ASTS is going to be doing $100s Millions of revenue per month. But mistake selling out IMO.

Good luck with RDW - very interesting company.; Check out $LUNR. It’s on 💥🔥; Lol I saw some daytrader pointing out 2 months ago how undervalued RDW is. After a brief review of the company I bought in. This is gonna go moon. Literally.; Sure I'm in for an even 150 shares. More of it dips; Another R stock? Good; Currently I am all in on RKLB with like 450 shares, ready to hold and buy for many years.

Have been thinking about Redwire too besides the others, but decided to focus on RKLB for the time being.; RDW just keeps printing money. [Revenue up 52.4% YoY to $87.8M](https://beyondspx.com/article/redwire-corporation-nyse-rdw-shares-could-be-significantly-undervalued) while ASTS and LUNR are still playing with pocket change. 

Space selfies with Mark Rober? [They're doing that](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/redwire-partners-youtuber-mark-rober-123000854.html). Military contracts? [Just grabbed another $45M from Air Force](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/redwire-awarded-45-million-contract-123000023.html). 

Their cameras are literally on the moon rn. Not some ""maybe one day"" BS like half these space stocks.

This thing's gonna rip harder than my wife's boyfriend's lambo. Loading up on Jan 2025 calls.

Positions: 500 shares @ $3.50, Jan 2025 $15c; Why are there rational analysis on my gambling sub?; If you see it on WSB, chances are, you’re too late. You’ll be exist liquidity.; Dam I think I missed this one; I have 500 shares (I’m poor).  It’s doing well tho; I sold my 1 call too soon, oh well, may my 10 shares fly high...; Been holding rdw for 6 months, was never allowed to post about it and stopped trying; Why didn't you include Q3 revenue from RKLB?

Looks like you're hiding some valuable information in the DD to make RDW look better..; What’s with the space stocks this last year; I’m regretting the covered calls at $17 I sold last week…; So it sounds like they have their toes in a large number of small add-ons and accessories for space missions.  Do they have any particular products or tech that is likely to scale up over the next few years?; What would the move be for calls?; As soon as it even gets volume and more price action to matter, they’ll just dilute shares to raise capital and rug retail. Fuck that.; Juicy; Have you made a posts about this stock before?

Thanks for sharing; Up 10% today nice; just in time to buy, so we can buy in high and sell when it'll crash; I just wanna invest in Spinlaunch bruh, fuck everybody else. Fuck rockets, we're going trebuchet power to launch satellites baby.; So this usually means I should buy puts.; https://preview.redd.it/0dbxrzjzjv9e1.gif?width=498&format=png8&s=d59118f630068e356ad144e68279c8181e98bb6c; Lost money on this in 2021 buying 2022 $10 leaps and sold my 100 shares I had. Had 100 $10 calls expire may 2022 worthless lol.; Thanks for your detailed post. I too own a modest position in RDW but had a question for you: any thoughts on some of their investors executing warrants that were issued over the last months/years? Do you feel like this would dilute the stock and cause a major contraction?

Additionally, what is the price point you are thinking 6 months from now?; Counter DD, when bots push pump and dumps, they often reply to their own comments repeatedly. Lmfao.; Blame WSB not me I tried posting this in October and they wouldn’t let me lmao then tried again twice in November. I’ve been trying to get y’all on the wave but WSB is the one that’s refused to let me. No pump and dump here just an opportunity that’s been completely disregarded compared to its peers yet is primed for growth especially with its volume and float; ""Room to run!"" WSB; A lot of people including me have been screaming RDW for months now; That’s my two cents here I’ve owned all of the others and still dabble but personally think RDW RKLB are the 2 to own for the next 5/10/20yrs+; Bitch you were the one that was wrong!; Yeah I sold all of mine at 2.5 lol didn’t see this coming (still made 5x). Given that, how does this possibly have a larger market cap than RDW lol I need someone to explain cause they just got out of NASDAQ jail and all the sudden they buy some bitcoin and they’re a 1b company? Not denying their battery technology but just don’t see how it’s more valuable than RDW considering what they’ve done/accomplished; What is KULR before I yolo; I bought 40k shares at .40 and sold at a loss when it dipped to .32 lmfao. Missed out on 120kish gains biggest mistake of the year.

Fortunately got in ASTS, LUNR, RKLB, IONQ, RGTI, RCAT, and some other shit 6 months ago, so I'm still up a couple 6 figures, but what an absolute FUMBLE to sell something for a LOSS that was literally weeks away from a 6 figure gain lmao.; Palladyne ai is up 60%; Bullish Af on KULR; I’m super bullish on ASTS. They’re one I’m accumulating to hold for 3+ years; seems like they’re still waiting on some type of approval for more testing.; I just took my profits on that. Figured 200% on a WSB was good enough to walk away with; Sitting on a nice +581% return from $RKLB with 500 shares. But I can’t decide if I should git while the gittin’s good or hold forever until they’re doing SpaceX launch volume and printing money; Yeah I mean i thought that about sound achr rcat lunr but look what happened; Where should I look to *not* be late?; It’s still early lol look at its multiple vs all of the other ones … currently trading 3x which is far below what LUNR ASTS KULR RKLB are trading at. 

Volume is under 700k avg vs 10M+ LUNR RKLB ASTS KULR 

Float is 1/10 of the others

This one hasn’t even been noticed yet…; Same; Yeah it’s crazy right? I was gonna stop but every time I see more good news and the volume trickles up a little but remains 1/10 that of any of the other space stocks even virgin galactic. I’m just like fuck how is no one on this yet so had to keep trying. This is a real gem over some of the other space meme stocks we’re seeing pop off (respect making money on them - I’m doing the same).; I wrote this originally before Q3 numbers came out I’ve been trying to post this literally since October 14th. Took me a few hours to compile all of it and really didn’t feel like going back to add more time lol

I’m definitely not here saying it should be valued the same as RKLB nor that you should sell any rklb to own RDW. I’m simply saying that while all other space stocks have had that run up and market attention and volume push, RDW fails to have it which puts it in a position to have the same thing happen to it that occurred for the others. That’s all - catch up time; He also stripped out 2024 guidance for RKLB and LUNR, both are growing at a far faster pace than RDW and they face less competition. His post is very frustrating as it misses loads of key facts about Redwire, a bullish factor is the significant increase in contract bidding ; Market catching up to the opportunity it presents; Nah. I read about Rocketlab when it was at $4 here on WSB.; SpaceX has drawn a ton of hype to the sector.; VLEO, space based manufacturing + pharma are the 2 I’m most excited about but they do have their fingers in a ton of other critical infrastructure for space; Look at the roll out solar arrays, they are on the ISS and more are being made for all satellites and spacecraft!; I’ll be completely honest I am not an options kinda guy I dabble but I’m certainly no expert I buy long and below where I know it’ll be (with pretty close to certainty or rather I’d be shocked if it wasn’t) in the money so I’m in on $4C for next May but planning to buy 2026 when they come out. Only let you buy up to Aug 2025 as of now; If that happens it’s the perfect time to buy! I loaded up at the $11/12 LUNR dip after they diluted.; 🫡; Don’t say “you” as if I fall into the “I only make investments into hyped stocks” category. I’ve owned this one for over 2 years. Just looking at other things here that have taken off recently and RDW has more consistent revenue, growth, and history than any of them minus RKLB

ASTS, LUNR, now even KULR has a larger market cap lmao

I’ve traded all of the above but they’re more hype than sound imo. I view it as RDW and RKLB are the picks and shovels for the space industry; Wait till neutron launch happens and Trump takes office with Elon on his side barking at him to give space a fat chunk of change that’s taken away from NASA and redistributed to the companies actually doing things. Space force was started in his last term and he’s been big saying “we’re going to get to mars”. Not to mention hypersonic missiles and the satellite race occurring before our eyes (Starlink, ASTS, GSAT, the EU now, etc etc). I see no reason this slows down I actually think it accelerates; I’m just active my man lol; Honestly this thing is up 400% this year on minimal volume … I personally think this one should be closer to 50-60 a share considering revenue numbers and growth; Which is subreddit is the best alternative without such strict moderation; Then what’s the next big thing?; Let us know next timee; Why did you you just DM us????; Yeah I bought in on 5 September after reading lots of comments about it on WSB. People complaining about not seeing it before are just incapable of reading.; Thx for the DD. 

I was curious why you chose to sell your LUNR. What makes it less worthy of holding than, say, RKLB, in your view? (I have some of each).; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787); Call your AI chatgpt lawyer!; I think $KULR is ripping on the breadth of the potential market with battery tech advancing across sectors. They do not yet have the revenue to back this up, but the groundwork of the partnerships seems to be there. I'm intrigued by $RDW going to have a look.; Just yolo on KULR. I got in at .40 cents back in November and now they are up to $4.55. It’s sustainable battery energy management. They have some huge government contracts, space contracts, as well as other major companies.; Carbon fiber stuff.  Took forever to get moving. When this was a penny stock, I  thought about it.  I completely missed it; Another pump and dump stock. You may get lucky if you buy it during pump.; Scam stock but has active volume. Not a long term hold yolo.; Look at your total gain/loss.

It’s easy to get caught up in thinking like this. 

If you’re way up overall, you’re doing great!; My 1/17 calls are up 500% I’m still greeding; I am on just over 200% since July this year, which maybe my best investment yet. I am kinda hoping there will be some drastic correction so I dont increase my average price when I continue to buy more next month.; Cannot win them all. I used to chase, now just stick to 8 stocks I like and only that.; What do you like? Technology? Clothes? Stick with what you know, when you see an opportunity, buy. Then you post on WSB lol.; Nice call bro; 3x multiple of what?; Okay i understand what you're trying to say. Thanks for the DD bro, looks like WSB should've given you green light last time!; Yeah I got in on RKLB and ASTS early based on DD here, I’m just unsure about if the space stocks are just riding the public curtails now or if there’s legit future; I’m also in on RKLB $2C Jan 2026 and $7C Jan 2027; Lmk what I need to do to prove I’m not a bot😂😂😭; Idk I can’t post anything either. It’s like Fort Knox; LODE; IONQ 😉; ?; They want it all on a silver platter; Not here to say LUNR won’t be worth more than it is today in the future because I do believe it will be but I watched it 3x in like 3 months so dipped it. Conviction with it isn’t there like RKLB and RDW for 2 reasons:

1) RDW and rklb have a history of action while LUNR (in my opinion) is still to be seen. Hope to see more action rather than hypotheticals and dreams. Yes they have great contracts but pay is dependent

2) picks and shovels vs the ones digging for gold. LUNR doesn’t exist without the RKLBs and RDWs of the world. I’d rather own the enablers so I’m longer on rklb and RDW potential.; I only text them, I don’t pay for voice credits; I think there’s a lot of social sentiment around $KULR right now as well.

They’re in the right place at the right time for a huge run right now
- they’re in space + batteries, two hot categories 
- they’re widely discussed online 
- the stock price is low (in dollars, not p/e), making it feel easy to buy
- lots of other small cap stocks ripping right now, people are looking for the next one 

Personally, I’m in for a few hundred shares around $3.25 average just for social/trend runup. 

I’m planning on selling a small percentage to get my initial investment back and letting the rest ride; I'm still too regarded to understand options. I just buy/sell shares.

I hope you win though.; Damn I just closed 1/3 calls when it hit the 19$ wall for 450%; P/S; The last 3 times lol; I mean not for nothing, it seems like you were really early on these. Seems like you know what you’re doing; Active is different than stupidly inefficient, mate.    
     
But, whatever, you do you. Enjoy pushing your P&D with your new alt.; I’m on the IONQ train, at 307% so far. 

Also just bought into DAVE; GSAT 🚀; Didn’t this already make a big move ? Ofc it can con still go higher . I’m a noob on Quantum computing but I’ll do my DD soon .; Pass; Should've messaged us privately.; Sometimes you just have to take your winnings you know? My gut tells me RDW and rklb are for the long haul 20-50x at least what they both sit at today. LUNR my gut is mixed, up in the air. Could 20-50x for sure but also like idk maybe it doesn’t. Not here to say the risk isn’t present with RDW or rklb because it certainly is there but I think a 20x on both of them is a “worst case scenario” like I truly can’t imagine either of them going to zero while LUNR again my gut says “idk”. Again I am not the type of trader to look at technicals all that much. Yes it’s important and yes it was clear there was a consolidation period for all stocks in this sector for 2-3yrs so run up was due to happen but I know what I like and what I’m interested in and being interested makes me dive really deep in on one thing or another. Space is one of these things and I don’t have the sound conviction i have with other players in the space. $GSAT is another I love right now. Massive consolidation, awesome news, $1.5B from Apple (including equity stake) and tons of insider buying this past week. Still holding the 2 range. LT Apple will make a play for the satellite space and gsat was who they picked to “win the battle” or at least power all of Apple; Checkout MVST, its battery tech and their Q3 earnings looked good. I have about 500 shares at $1 _average, it’s been riding the KULR wave.; I’ll explain (I’m regarded also) 

You buy the option to buy 100 shares at that price in the future. So now when the price goes up $1 it goes up $100 or whatever as a percent of your option. 

You dont have to actually buy all the 100 shares bc you can sell it when it’s up in value


I am not a financial advisor; The way options clicked for me was this analogy: You want to enter in an auction, the entry fee (premium) in the pre-auction area is 100 dollars at this moment of the time, and you buy the ticket from another person (call seller - who realized he doesn't need to buy anything at the auction.)

Now as you hang around the place, you also come to realize that there isn't anything of interest to buy there; you decide not to participate in the auction, and so you go outside to sell your ticket but now suddenly, you sell it for 300 dollars. 

Why? because the auction became far more popular by the time you hanged around there and now there are more people who want to buy your entrance ticket at a higher price (premium).

So you sell this ticket for 300, which gave you a profit of 200 dollars. That's how ""not exercising"", or better said selling call options work; you paid a premium for the right to buy 100 shares by a certain time at a certain price, and if that price becomes reality, more people want to buy that option and so the premium increases, so you sell ""that right to own 100 shares to someone else for a higher premium than what you paid for it"".; Still a win; I just finished researching them and looking at their financials. Amazing find! I am grateful for you
Could you tell me how did you find it over 2 years ago?; I just know certain verticals/industries really really well cause im hella interested in them and i bet on the horse(s) i think are gonna win 2/5/10 years out; Why gsat?; Is that the ticker?; Who is us lol I don’t know what you’re talking about; on RDW, most of the gainers this year have action in the penny stock subs, not this sub. 

GSAT is already 4bil market cap while negative EPS. how much upside is there?; Thanks for your responses.; I’ll check it out!; because he can't afford ASTS; Look at the chart; The entire sub. You could've messaged us privately; I didn’t message anyone bro idk what the hell you’re on about; Downvote this clown ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258); I believe he’s trying to say that since you couldn’t post back in October, you should have somehow messaged everyone on the sub instead lol; I'm saying you should've thought. Should've messaged us all individually; Ah I see yeah sounds reasonable🫠😂😂"

They create the chip and tech for it to communicate to satellites. I think Android devices are looking at it too.; You always invest in the bottleneck. Phone connectivity is essentially a bottleneck.

After they retired the 13% 2029 Senior debt of $219MM,  they only have $175MM debt remaining.  As of 9/30/24, they had assets of $917MM.  

That's a 5:1 asset-to-debt ratio, VERY strong, especially for a capital intensive business!!; Globalstar will retire me; I di believe this is good for both business and clients. it’s creating a stronger network able to help customer. I hope this company gets it together in their product department and starts coming out with some groundbreaking innovations.; Globalstar $gsat debt update.

As of September 30, 2024, Globalstar reported total debt of approximately $394.4 million, with $34.6 million short-term and $359.8 million long-term debt. 

In November 2024, Globalstar announced an expanded agreement with Apple, which includes a prepayment of up to $1.1 billion for infrastructure and funds to retire Globalstar's 13% senior notes due 2029. 

Globalstar's 13% Senior Notes due 2029 have an outstanding principal amount of $219 million.  The total amount required for the debt retirement is approximately $232 million, including an additional $13 million in make-whole fees.

Therefore, after retiring the 2029 Senior Notes, Globalstar would have $141 million LT debt remaining. Total debt would be $175 million.; SpaceX jumps in: ""the hell you are!""; So ASTS pointless yet?; Surveillance...; Is this gonna be another one of those things where theybinvest money into somrthing that eventually fails and thus have to fall back on somrthing that is alreadynproven to be stable such as Starlink?

The person you responded to already said just that, but the service is a completely different animal from ASTS. ; Yup; Google Fi my friend; So, right now I already use my phone tethered for USB hotspot, I wonder if the satellite data would work the same way; Mango router; 1. All messages and data is E-2-E encrypted
2. So, you think your mobile carrier is better? 🤣; Even if it's a hundred dollars a month it would be great. Plenty of people are already paying that and if you can use your service world wide it would be amazing.

Crazy to think we used to pay for each text message.; So you enjoy seeing your investment deteriorate over time. Horrible week to have both. ; It says right on the website it's LTE speeds. That is 15mbps, fast enough to stream Netflix at 4k. 


You have no idea what you are talking about. 


$GSAT sucks, they are having a reverse split next year. End of story. ; Fi provides access to terrestrial cellular towers by reselling T-mobile, and I may not be reading the room correctly, but I think folks are talking about space-based cellular. T-mo is working on this with Starlink / SpaceX, but resellers rarely get the latest offerings. ASTS is also working to provide direct-to-cell global coverage. 

Globalstar probably wants to provide this service, but currently they require another device - a sat phone / rather than using your existing cell phone.; Google Fi is pretty great but they’re buggy at times. I’ve had to call support multiple times because my data just up and quit until I reinstalled everything; In theory, the next little while will see satellite internet service as if your typical cell phone tower has now been launched into orbit. Everything else is the same. The signal, the speed, except now with nearly limitless range.

But so far with apple and globalstar, the service is fairly minimal and requires specialized satellite receptive hardware (iPhone 15 and newer) rather than using your existing cell phone.

So when the newer, better networks get up and running, and as long you can afford it (might be costly at first), you should be able to receive a sat. signal on even ancient phones, apple, android, or whatever. So you can imagine the broad appeal this will generate. No more dead zone as you drive down dangerous highways. No more need for a brand new phone either.

In fact, it may even render apple’s venture with globalstar entirely obsolete. The deciding factor will be cost (until the market matures).; Ikr! If they could fit it in a iPhone, I don’t see why they couldn’t fit it in a MacBook or a iPad. Imagine the day you no longer need to pay outrageous data rates while travelling. 

I would switch over to Mac instantly for this.; 1. They sell meta data, not your encrypted data. Hi I did work for top3 companies in the adverse.
2. Mobile carriers can't sell your data in Europe, aapl are trying to circumvent it.
3. You're an idiot.; I remember being a horny little kid and texting some chick out in Cali when I first got a phone. (I’m all the way on the east coast.) Bill came out to like $600. My mom cancelled that shit right away; I’m up over 1000% on KULR. 
 
I hope 2025 is prosperous for you.; You went completely silent once you were corrected. Why? ; Take the profit bud - I sold it last week. 
Same to you! Cheers!!!; It says right on the website it's LTE speeds. That is 15mbps, fast enough to stream Netflix at 4k.

42,"NVIDIA's $30 billion net retail buy-in in 2024 and when NVIDIA's market cap will overtake Apple's with the rise of artificial intelligence

","Retail investors bought nearly $30 billion of NVIDIA stock this year through Dec. 17, making it the company with the largest retail inflow this year, according to Vanda research data. That's nearly twice as much as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), a large-cap U.S. stock ETF, and is on track to overtake Tesla, which will be “Retail's Favorite Stock” in 2023

https://preview.redd.it/dui8qh7dc79e1.jpg?width=353&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=131be4eca17c3e1afa52c8f3b230213598115518

Marco Iachini, senior vice president of research at Vanda, said, “NVIDIA's stock price has risen so spectacularly that it has stolen the limelight from Tesla.”



　　



NVIDIA has been favored by investors large and small over the past year or so. Last month, NVIDIA officially joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average and was the top performer among the index's 30 components. Despite slightly volatile trading in December, NVIDIA is still on track to realize a gain of more than 180% by the end of 2024. Today, its market capitalization has surpassed $3 trillion, making it the second-largest U.S. company by market capitalization, behind Apple.



　　



NVIDIA's retail investor position has also increased significantly. According to Vanda's data, NVIDIA's weighting in retail portfolios has risen from 5.5% earlier this year to more than 10%. Currently, NVIDIA is the second-largest position for retail investors, behind Tesla. This year, net inflows of retail money into NVIDIA are up more than 885% from three years ago.

[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse); What a bearish articol; Ya’ll can argue about NVDA APL et al but let me enjoy my 180% unrealized gains; NVDA gonna overtake AAPL market cap next year. [Revenue up 122% YoY with $30.04B](https://beyondspx.com/article/nvidia-the-ai-powerhouse-dominating-the-semiconductor-landscape) last quarter. Straight cash machine. Meanwhile Apple's sitting there with their [14% services revenue growth](https://beyondspx.com/article/apple-inc-nasdaq-aapl-embracing-the-future-with-cutting-edge-innovation) trying to figure out how to make Siri not stupid. 

NVDA's got that AI monopoly locked down tight. [AI agents dropping in 2025](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/from-microsoft-to-nvidia-the-ai-agents-are-coming-in-2025-141314094.html). Gonna make bank. 

Retail knows what's up. $30B buy-in this year wasn't dumb money. Was smart money. 

TLDR: NVDA 🚀🚀🚀; Selling all my Nvda at this point and moving it to Intel.; I see NVDA, I downvote. Fk you and shit stock.; Yes, NDVA is dead money now.  Do as I say.; But why; The AI we currently have access to is the most rudimentary, 0.1 of human civilization; So Puts?; Retail Christmas spend up 6% yoy. Brokies just yell about it lol; Lol AAPL makes more revenue from services alone than the whole of NVDA.; They have been flat for 28 years… goodluck lmao; Guess you don’t like money.; Put your money where your mouth is and buy some puts.;  Awarded 5 billion nasa contract also added to aerospace and defense fund; People constantly ignore this, we are in the Mosaic/Netscape stage of AI not in the iPhone 16 Pro stage. Impressive as it may be this is still infant technology.; r/aliens; Too early.; Logic and fundamentals have no place in this market my sweet summer child.; Exactly. It’s frustrating how true this is. It was painful, looking at that chart of the top gainers for the year.; And Walmart makes damn near double the revenue as AAPL. That makes them a better buy?

It’s the net income that matters, regard. Look up NVDA’s profits compared to Apple’s, especially 2025 estimates — and NVDA’s growing cash pile which is expected to hit $200B by 2026, then come back and report. And don’t forget the fucking fries; They don’t have any money they didn’t buy NVDA 😂; Oh neat, I knew I got some for a reason; Still god to buy now? I’m a ~beary~ mood; The biggest question that will determine what happens with AI is if we can continue to grow the compute necessary to advance it. AI is quickly running up against our compute limits of silicon tech, and quantum computing is still trapped in its infancy. The question is if the AI ""hotness"" will cool off before quantum computing catches up. We might have another generation of AI LLMs before we hit limits of compute that we can throw at it without the services being so insanely overpriced that no-one will buy them. o3 is likely that limit, as looking at the pricing for o1, we're already hitting limits of what I'm seeing my customer's budgets would stretch for. And those customers are some of the biggest fortune 500 med-tech, fin-tech, and manufacturing companies in the world. If o3 can't fit in those budgets, we're likely to see advancement slow in 2025 dramatically until compute costs can catch up. If we don't see a breakthrough in multi-qubit systems in 2025, we likely won't see AGI until 2030 or beyond. If there is a major multi-qubit compute breakthrough in 2025, we could see AGI by 2030.

Though all of this is speculation and just based on my understanding of the challenges that NVIDIA and others are running into making AI accelerators on the existing 3nm silicon nodes and upcoming 2nm nodes. There's a huge problem that silicon-based transistors are running up against called quantum tunnelling. It's what's causing the cost of silicon chips to dramatically rise as the yields at the sizes we're working at now are so low, and the costs to produce each chip are higher as well, since these chips need to use more and more of the die footprint as they're getting larger instead of smaller to add more compute. If we can't overcome quantum tunneling with a swap to a new material, or a change in the transistor architecture, we're likely to see the theoretical die-shrinkage limits of silicon based transistors in the 2nm or 18A fab processes in 2025/2026. That means either chips will continue to grow in size, causing costs to continue to rise, or we'll stagnate in generational compute growth. Just think, the 4090 is 608.5mm\^2 with about 76 Billion transistors. The 3090 was 628mm\^2 with about 28 Billion transistors, and the Titan RTX was 754mm with only 18.6 Billion transistors. We've relied on generational die shrinkage to increase both transistor count, and shrink the transistor-per-millimeter count in order to increase compute. Rumors are that the 5090 die size is 744mm\^2. That's a bad sign. It's likely that they weren't able to get 120+ Billion Transistors or more in the 600mm\^2 that we're likely to see in the 5090. This is all based on speculation around the rumored specs. I'd wager the 5090 will come in right around 125-130 Billion Transistors. If they are only able to cram 130 Billion transistors in 744mm\^2, that means that we're going to see a huge slowing of generational compute increases on silicon until there's some tech breakthrough. The 5090 is supposed to be on the newer 3nm node from TSMC, as Samsung doesn't have a node that can cram 120+ Billion transistors into a 700mm\^2 die right now. If 2nm doesn't put 200+ Billion transistors in a 500mm\^2 die, then compute is going to either get large again, which leads to much more expensive chips, or we're going to see a slowing down of compute increases.; Market is pricing in apple 16 pro stage when it has almost 0 uses right now

What's the price going to be when it hits apple 16 pro stage? 20 quadrillion?; Great nuance and point - totally lost on most.; Not necessarily. We are much closer to the physical limits of computer technology now than we were in the '90s. It's always possible that some innovation will push the bar further, but it's yet to be seen.; The market is forward trading so we are anticipating the iphone stage. For nvidia and AI companies to explode more, we need to see the equivalent of AI destroying labor markets.

Which it can hit. Just be aware this is what your betting on/against, not this current AI.; Did I ever say aapl was the better buy? I was just replying to the top commenter on his dumb take that Nvda should have the bigger cap than aapl. 

You talk about net income lmfao and aapl makes almost 4x the net income of Nvda. U think Nvdas gross profit margin is gonna stay at 70% for any longer? Keep dreaming. 

Fucking dumbass pack the fries yourself bruh; >  Walmart has actually been a better buy; Yes. When they announce lift off date for lander, which is within weeks. Check out some great DD on intuitive machines Reddit; https://preview.redd.it/vekaok7nu79e1.jpeg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a195d0dda391257eb94d539a85fdebe6613dbfd; This seems more like summarizing what you think you read on tech articles rather than any actual personal opinion/analysis. ; Except things like active inference is being developed that shows potential to have better AI capabilities with a 100th of the compute power. 

Verses.ai; Thanks for that! Do you have any opinion on ASML's growth regarding this?; >0 uses; >What's the price going to be when it hits apple 16 pro stage? 20 quadrillion?

I would take that, tbh.; thank you; AAPL 2024 net income: $93.74B
NVDA 2024 net income: $29.76B

Keep in mind, AAPLs net profit has been declining the last four quarters, pretty significantly. 

NVDA’s is growing. Add in the annual variance with Rubin coming, and yeah, 70% will be maintained.; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)

Remindme! 1 year; Dude wrote a bible on a gambling subreddit; ASML makes the machines that the fabs use. They have some of the world’s best semiconductor scientists working on these problems. But a competitor could just as well make the missing breakthrough that puts them on their back foot. It’s a race, and ASML has an edge, but an edge doesn’t guarantee a win.; appreciate it tho; lol, early morning coffee rant. Gotta love when your brain just gets away from ya."
43,Investing 10K USD Suggestions,"I am 27. I was thinking of buying a house in the near future, and wanted to build up my down payment. Let’s saw my goal is 100k. Or is that too high?

So for context.

I invested $3k into GME when it was like $36 back in march or April of 2021. I guess I do regret not selling when it hit 310, but I’ve held onto it cause why not. And it’s sitting at about 10k. I guess there was a stock split because I thought I was in the red at $32 but I seem to have more than tripled my value.

On top of that I had $15k in cash I wanted to invest so for the time being I bought like $500-1200 worth of Intel, AMD, Nvidia, Apple, SPY, and DOW.

I have 10k cash left.

I don’t know if I should just keep it in my Apple savings at 3.8%, or shove it into Nvidia, or Apple, or SPY or one of Schwab’s options.

Any suggestions are welcome.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hmhpjr/investing_10k_usd_suggestions/,5,2024-12-26 06:26:11,"All i can say is that you have your expectations way, way, way off. Last couple of years ‘the magnificent 7’ stocks (google them) did pretty good but this is not something you may expect every year. For a diversified portfolio you can hope for an average of 9-10% a year. So if you invest 10k next year you have 11k. Thats it. If you want to buy a house within 5-10 years i would advise against investing at all especially if you think going from 10k to even 30k is an easy task. Please don’t go broke on all the social media guru’s bs advice.; 10k into short dated call options should get you there; If you’re planning on buying a home “in the near future” then investing in equities may not be the most appropriate option. Equities are a highly volatile and risky asset to hold short-term regardless of diversification, which you seriously lack. Meaning there remains a solid possibility your portfolio could go down and take many YEARS to recover. 

Investing is a long-term game. I wouldn’t buy equities I didn’t plan to hold for at least 7-10 years (although some may recommend closer to 5 years as a minimum). 

An alternative option for the short-term would be piling your money into USFR/TFLO, SGOV, or a MMF all of which will give you a greater return than your Apple savings account plus greater state tax efficiency.; Like you I proudly wear my ‘GME 2021 Short Squeeze’ service medal with pride and retain one share in GME so that I hopefully never forget such interesting times for retail investor power.

If you are thinking of buying a house in the ‘near future’ the stock market may not be the best place for the cash as it could end up tied up in a stock for some time depending upon how it all pans out.

That said, if you can afford to speculate (and possibly lose money or leave it tied up for a while) then there are many opportunities out there. I don’t give stock specific suggestions but my new r/DoubleBubbler sub may give some ideas.; Is there an index fund that tracks the magnificent 7?; Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.

Go back 10 or 20 years ago to see what the equivalent “magnificent 7” were back then. In 2004 you would have invested in the then top company, General Electric."
44,Do you use margin and if so how much?,"Margin is such an interesting subject. If the interest rate of a margin loan is below the average return of the S&P500 it seems smart to use at least some margin. Obviously not an amount that quickly eats away at the underlying capital but a conservative amount like 10-20% seems like a very easy way to pad a portfolio. 

I know there is also a popular ‘rich people’ strategy of buy, borrow, and die so that you never have to face the capital gains tax and can get a solid step up basis for the next generation. But even beyond that it seems smart if you are simply using the margin funds to buy more of the underlying asset, especially with the tax advantages that come with it. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hmgag4/do_you_use_margin_and_if_so_how_much/,26,2024-12-26 04:57:15,"No. I only used it once to buy a car in full. That was back when margin rates were 2.25% and car loans were 6-7%. I paid off the margin loan when rates started going up. I never use margin to invest because that is how people blow up their portfolios.; No I’ve heard margarine is dangerous so I’ve gone to full butter; On my brokerage the current margin loan rate is significantly higher than the avg S&P return unless you're rich. If we stay in this crazy bull market then yeah, it's worth it. That's not guaranteed though.

I'd avoid using margin loans except on a short-term temporary basis, to bet on this bull market you're better off putting the money you'd spend on margin loan interest into a leveraged ETF instead - no risk of margin calls and while with its own upsides and downsides the cost of the leverage via ETF is much cheaper.; No. I used it once amd got burned, to each their own though.  If it works out, don't assume it will always work out; Up to 50% but very short term.
Unless I need a short term loan to buy a house or something. Then I tap into it also. Dirt cheap at IBKR.; Using to level up my dividend account.  Use to buy on ex-date, use only 50% of what I get in dividends the following month, so it is always paid off within 10-20 days. This way I get the deal on the etf I want and grows the monthly dividends each month.  Plus the interest expense is tax deductible as I itemize.; I don't. It always struck me as extremely risky.; I just think of it as another line of credit if I ever need one. It tends to have a lower interest rate than other loans, doesn't have a payback schedule, and isn't reported. For those reasons, it's pretty high on the list in situations where I want to borrow. 


I've never used it to invest. ; I'm a gambler.  I know my limits and being on margin is not one of them.  Fuck that jazz.  I'd ruin myself and family.; It's on in the brokerages, only to allow a buy of something if an opportunity arises without having to raise and transfer funds to be able to get it.  Day or two later all is settled in the green.; I use margin. Everything is held in margin (i.e., not cash). That way, when I sell, I don't have to wait to settle. I never pay interest and can not be margin called so long as my settled cash is always >= 0. Also, margin is required to short sell.; I have only used margin as a way to take cash out of my portfolio without selling stocks.; If I have money in another account or securities I'm unloading and I want to buy right away? Absolutely 


As a long term strategy never. Even back in 2020 the margin rate was 3%, now I believe the lowest is around 8%. That is well above the risk free rate.; Had a few repairs needed for the house that came out of nowhere. Totaled around 10k. CC interest rate is around 20% and margin is half of that. So I withdrew against my brokerage account; I buy rental properties with mine then have the cash flow pay it off; I use it when I see a clear and obvious buying opportunity. Never more than that. LUNR took a massive unwarranted dump from $16 to $11 ish. I scooped up a bunch at $11 and am almost up 50%. 

Now this doesn’t always work. But I’ve found it works best for me, and I don’t get caught holding a margin position for way too long that way.; I use margin for short term liquidity but don't use more than I could cover if the equities backing it were to go to zero. I also use it to sell naked puts when buying stocks, but this is extremely risky and again, I only use what I could cover from other funds if I was assigned everything and only on securities I'm actively trying to acquire. I wouldn't use margin to purchase but/hold securities unless it was a small amount that you could cover from something else.

You are totally right that margin is interesting and you can absolutely get a better return on capital by using it. However, if you are reckless you can easily lose a crazy amount of money.; I had 100k a few months ago and used margin. The account is currently at 1.4Million; I use a large portion of the margin available to me. The larger my portfolio, the more comfortable I am using some margin. I just sure my portfolio can absorb any significant corrections so that I don't get margin called. I should mention that I'm also single so I'm probably more risk-on than most.; I thought about using margin for short options on ibkr but their calculation of the margin impact is incredible intransparent. I made a python script to simulate the margin impact and compared all available strike prices for the next year. The maintenance margin changes a lot during the year. In some cases from 20% to 80% upon closer expiration (even far otm). Thats far to risky for me.; Yes, on my dividend account. Typically around 200%. I don’t use it on any other accounts, but I will buy an etf that uses up to 25%.; I used margin to pay for a operation I needed on my head, kept all my investments in tact. I think it’s worth it in situations like that, has been 4 months and I’ve only gained about $130 in interest; I suggest you read the 2007 Mortgage Your Retirement horror story over on Bogleheads. 

https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5934; I'll be swapping to margin use to pay for expenses and keep income levels low for tax advantages, ACA benefits ( by keeping reportable income low), and convert trad to ROTH more heavily each year.  I figure the 4-5% outperforms the minimum 10% tax on trad IRA in the long run.; No; No.; I do not use margin, but I do have some Closed End Funds (CEF) that use leverage.  My reasoning being that they can borrow at much better rates than I can.  This also lets me keep the leveraged part of my portfolio firewalled from the responsible parts.; In my Japanese portfolio I use 20-30% margin because the interest rates are very low. Generally I'm very wary of margin and only use it for transactional float.; Leveraged ETFs; I park Robinhood’s 1K margin into SGOV. Set my limit to $999.99. Combined with the Roth 3% match it’s essentially free money as the margin is at 0% interest.; I don't do hard drugs; I have one portfolio that's modestly geared (35%), and my holdings need to drop about 50% before I have to worry about margin calls. The interest I pay is tax deductible and my provider also contributes to my frequent flyer program.; You can use margin in a variety of ways. It's not always just to borrow to buy more securities. 

IMO - the more interestingly related subject is leverage and how to efficiently use it and manage risk.; If you ask yourself the question ""If using margin to buy assets is so smart, why aren't the banks using their money to buy assets instead of lending ~~a sucker~~ you money for a theoretically smaller but guaranteed return"" then the answer is obvious.; My recent trade get 15% returns, then I start to use margin. I lost all the gains in two days. Will never use it for investing.; I can’t believe it; Vegetable oils are actually better for you than animal fats.; How'd you get burned? Invested in a single stock and it tanked?; They let you withdraw margin?!?; Which stock/ETF?; Yup. Brokerages offer it because it makes them money.; Same. I leave overly optimistic buy orders open on certain stocks. If there's the random piece of bad news that sparks a panic, like the McDonald's e. Coli thing a few months ago, I'll grab a bit of the stock at a good price and either transfer in some cash, sell off an index fund that didn't similarly plunge to cover it, or sell it for an almost immediate profit.

But I never let margin debt sit for more than a day or two.; What happens in a recession when your renters can't make their payments?; There’s regulations preventing banks from doing that; Regionals and smaller banks do this. They lend money to local businesses and developers using the money they get from deposits. Then, they quickly create a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to buy those loans off their balance sheets and handle them for investors as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). The period between giving out the loans and setting up the SPV to take them off their books is their margin loan.; You don’t need for it to tank you are actively accruing interest; This was 2 decades ago; Yes. What you use the money for does not matter as long as you keep the requirements.; Of course as long as you have enough collateral in your account to cover it; Here is my dividend portfolio I posted awhile ago, been adding steadily since tho

https://www.reddit.com/r/dividendgang/s/rMHc1wvKJP

Here is my watchlist, only buy when the price is below the 12 week median, plus I have a few other criteria I have set up on the tracker.

https://www.reddit.com/r/dividendgang/s/GNgNNKSa6w; And since your stock is somewhat used to guarantee their loan to you it's a lower risk for higher reward for them.

I always wonder if Murphy is watching.; Then I would stop paying off the margin loan until I refill the unit. My day job can cover the mortgages no problem. My job is recession proof; My meta-point is that the reason the brokerages offer margin is because it's profitable for them, not because it's good for you. Leverage amplifies gains when you win, and amplifies losses when you lose. I'm not gonna say you should *never* use it, but if you *need* to use it you probably shouldn't. A bad year with a cash portfolio hurts. A bad year with a heavily margined portfolio is ruin.; Big difference because their loans are secured, whereas your YOLO into Bob's School Of Culinary Design And Auto Repair is not.; At this point the interest is only 5.75%-7% on many major brokerages. I end up paying like a few cents a day. If you can't outpace a few cents a day you need to rethink your strategy.; Interesting, thanks.; Ok but when banks could use your money to trade stocks they did trade your money to trade stocks; Not all are Asset-Based Loans (ABLs), most are trade finance loans.; Historically the SP rate of return is about 9-10%. Taking a loan at 6-7% and hoping for 9.5% isn't exactly fail proof. 

If your underlying securities drop in value your brokerage will sell those on your behalf to cover your margin, they're not going to give you a few months to see if your stocks recover.; Try running that scenario between 2000 and 2010.; Not at all saying it's fail proof, but the downvotes are odd. If you think you have a strategy that can outpace the margin rate, I see absolutely no reason not to do it. If you can't, skip it. The point in my original comment is that if you're LOSING money on margin, it's pointless to use."

Most users will choose Google anyways.; Mother of pearl. Time to buy goog calls; game on apple just threw some shade at the feds good luck with that; As a shareholder in both companies yayyyy; It would be pretty great if the DOJ kills this payment.  Google clearly doesn’t need it — they got rid of defaults in the EU already and it was fine, not even newsworthy 

Apple needs it tho.  I think that’s why Google still pays it.  To maintain peace; The best solution.

DOJ just slaps a $500m fine on google and calls it quit.

Tells them to do better and help other companies in open source. 

It's on the best interest of DOJ aswell because they won't be winning this current case against them.; Is that AAPLs music I hear?; When 90% of the browser market uses Chrome or version of Chroimum. That makes Google the God emperor, judge, jury and executioner of all things internet, W3C open internet standards be damned.

Will this have any future bearing?; https://preview.redd.it/59hq72b9o39e1.jpeg?width=2124&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8b4b22712cce7054d590d3473f6fee4868417f89; All my fresh linux installs come with firefox though!; Google search has got so much worse, and its auto-correcting garbage I didn’t want entered into the search box in the first place. Google is hot garbage lately. Cant wait for OpenAi search to take over as default.; Actually Mozilla got fucked the most. Firefox would die without Google and Mozilla's only source of revenue has been their google search deal.

Ironic how an anti trust case on Google search is going to kill off one of the two remaining non-chromium browser lmao. Google Chromium is going to be the new web specifications.; Yep; I mean it's not like they just lose search, they'll make money off the divestment. it's just that the market doesn't like cash over earnings right; I thought Google pays Apple for that.

Google and competitors would pay Apple based on their search queries.; [deleted]; If google beats DOJ and they probably will.

This thing will RUN faster then Usain bolt to $3T; I'm seeing at least a 50% upside to the stock if Google can get out of it with minimal concessions.  It's already fairly under valued compared to its competitors by about that much.  Timing is the question, and whether or not calls are the right play given it could take some time. That said, it's been going up recently, so it might just be a good time to ride the wave.; The best solution is the new DOJ drops the whole case. 

It never made any sense, DOJ twisting themselves into a pretzel trying to find “remedies” for a non existent problem.; Why do you think all these tech executives are going down to Mar-a-Lago to kiss the ring? They’re trying to squash all these DOJ actions.; Mozilla also collects a huge amount of donations. They spend more money on lobbying/politics and grants than developing their browser. They recently acquired an advertisement business to make more money and simultaneously fired a huge portion of their developers. Unfortunately Mozilla decided there are more important things than Firefox.; Firefox has been declining in user count for years. They’ve been fucked and it’s not because of search deals.; There are others that don't use WebKit, ladybird is coming along there is also Servo for embedded. Both have funding outside google.; One of the results of the case is that Google will have to sell chrome and android.; Yeah that's one of the only issue I have with the lawsuit. It's fine if the court makes Google stop paying Apple, but the Firefox deal should stay.

As for making Google sell Chrome browser I am certain any other company rich enough to buy it will absolutely make it worse, The only one I trust which wouldn't is Steam, maybe Apple. Steam has an incentive to buy it because their store runs on Chrome.; [deleted]; As someone who makes software for browsers: good.; Europe requires people get to choose. Didn’t hurt Google’s bottom line.

Likely where we’re headed in the US.; Then how is  chrome is the most used browser on windows?

More directly to your point : they got rid of search engine defaults in the EU on Android phones in 2021 and nothing changed. There was a prompt screen and everyone picked G; At least in the EU I don’t think you are allowed to default it more. If you download a browser you are asked what you want your default search to be; Pichai already paid his respects to donnie at Mar-a-lago. It's all good now. LFGO!!; How long would it take for this case to come to verdict? Wouldn't this be like 3-5 years of grinding with DOJ seems far out?; This case w AAPL backing is a big deal; depends on how nicely Google plays with Trump; Seriously. People can change the default browser at any time.; Bullish; nowhere near the Google royalties though, that makes up 87% of their revenue; They're also spending a lot of their money on executives' salaries and DEI vacations.; Duckduck something ; Chromium not chrome; Steam runs off Chromium which is open source. Chrome being bought or sold does not directly effect what they can do there. Google does however do a lot of work on web standards and maintaining Chromium so it could hurt development there.

Loads of companies use Chromium. Electron apps are basically chromium browsers, things like Slack, Discord, Spotify for example.; Google employee here,

I use Firefox at work because Google-Chrome on my machine has to always be logged into my corp-employee-account. I don't wanna mix up personal stuff with work-browser-history. Before Chrome showed up, Firefox was great - and it still is for the most part if you don't bloat it with dozens of extensions.

Also... nobody wants to say it out loud, but Firefox's `__LACK__` of Chromecast functionality makes pr0n & spicy tiktok vids safer to watch. Nobody wants to accidentally cast their private fantasies to the livingroom where the family is. If Mozilla is smart, they will never add casting support to Firefox - or at least they'll hide it behind a bunch of ""about:config"" stuff.; Firefox is fantastic. Everything else is pretty much cheap makeup on a chromium pig.; It's good for mobile since you can actually use ublock origin on it.; Mozilla Firefox is the best. If you want a browser with adblock on your phone it's the best way.; It's literally better than chrome but unfortunately things like YouTube detect your not on chrome and make your experience worse; If you really think straying away from the W3C standards to some vendor specific nonsense like how it was back in the IE days is going to make your life easier, you are going to be surprised. It's already bad enough. We are at a point where we need a fucking toolkit to write a goddamn stylesheet that works on WebKit, Firefox and Chromium.

Google saved us from the explorer monopoly but they are going to become the new explorer in a hot minute.; All my passwords are saved in chrome and I don't feel like switching them to edge. ; Legacy. Chrome came out during a time when default window browser was terrible and everyone uses google products for the most part. Then Microsoft moved to edge and has its own suite. So, you stick with what you know works and download chrome. And that is for most who care.

If you don’t care, you just stick with what’s on your desktop. There js nothing inherently wrong with the Microsoft stack these days.; Safari on iOS has long had a lot more functionality than other browsers such as Apple Pay integration etc. so people usually stick with that as iOS browser default, and then Google comes as the default search engine within that browser

as for desktop browsers on Windows, the EU required Microsoft to offer multiple choices of default browsers upon installation (EU is similarly requiring Apple to offer choices of default browsers for iOS as well now), plus Internet Explorer was so shitty and lacking in functionality that people were moving to Firefox/Chrome in droves - that in turn made Firefox/Chrome the de facto standard for many web developers, so it created a feedback cycle where web developers would mostly focus on Firefox/Chrome standards/support = many sites were not compatible with Internet Explorer = more people download and use Chrome instead = more web developers focus on Firefox/Chrome and the cycle continues

same chicken-and-egg problem on why Windows Phone failed: everyone being on Android/iOS = tiny customer base for Windows Mobile app developers = no one makes apps for Windows Mobile = no one wants to buy a Windows phone and the cycle continues; And on the phone. He called trump to tell him the McDonald's stunt was #1 on search at the time.; Also, forgot to mention, I have 25 shares at $170 cost basis currently I plan to hold for pretty much till the end of time, however calls might be the play right now. I see a lot of potential upside in the short term, and reading into the DoJ case, it doesn't look likely Google gets broken up and moreso than they just change some of their practices.; Do you know how search works?; What in the Rightwing fuckery is this kind of comment?; huh? Chromium is open source and Google doesn't really 'own' it, browsers like Brave, Edge etc are branched off of Chromium. Google owns Chrome so he's correct (except I'm pretty sure it hasn't been confirmed that they have to sell off).; Hahaha let that be the one function i miss in Firefox, being able to cast to my screens. Chrome wouldnt even be installed anymore if Firefox had that.

Pro tip, you start the stream before you start the content 😂;  What about brave? Has pre installed ad block; Not if your phone runs iOS; The funny thing is Edge is built on the chromium engine which is the engine built for Chrome. This means even Microsoft admits it's a better engine.; Yea… if everything was just chromium life would be much simpler. Can’t tell you how many hours go into dealing with FF deficiencies.; This’s still not a good argument though. Are we going to hit every company that became a brand? 

You give people a choice. They pick for whatever reason. I don’t see a clear abuse here.; why are you expecting any different for search engine defaults then?

(also I disagree but curious to ⬆️ first); Will Apple be required to offer other actual browsers or will they still be safari with makeup? Because to me that seems way more monopolistic.; Pichai be like I'm with you way before the win please let me go this time 👉🏽🥺👈🏽; I'm not familiar with it but with Firefox you can have other extensions. If Braze also has that I'd say both are good.; Spoken like a true frontend webdev. Maybe if you stick to W3C you wouldn't have to spend hours. Firefox implements the standard well and sufficiently. You are probably relying on undefined behavior.; I mean, I want google to have chrome and Mozilla to have Firefox after this. 

I believe google handicapping itself By limiting the type and usage of data coming from chrome and android. The internet is very important for the survival of google and supporting a browser to ensure people to continue to use the internet is in their vested interest even if it doesn’t directly help their bottom line. Android is less important for data, but still is important to their bottom line. Google is a steward of the internet whether people like it or not. I would think every agency in the us regarding US national security doesnt want google not having android or chrome, or at the very least they need to be held by large, wealthy firms that can pour the money into them to ensure the applications are properly maintained for security reasons. 

With google on the chopping block, I was thinking nvidia should be on the chopping block as cuda gave them so much influence over gpu computing if google is being it for data monopoly. Different level, but to ensure we don’t end up with only nvidia in the gpu computing space, other companies need to be at least compatible with cuda for end consumers can consider them for their deployments.; Just realized I didn’t directly answer your question. I’m open to choice. Right now, you have Apple, google, Microsoft offering online solutions for your every day productivity needs off the top of my head. Offline, you have free alternatives like libreoffice. 

In terms of browsers, i dont believe one should be it and I want Mozilla with Firefox to stick around. It’s just the most expensive application to build and maintain probably on most people’s computer after the operating system. And so you just don’t have these things survive without corporate support. We have WebKit, chromium, and Firefox as the core and only real browser engines. WebKit is apples and apple has enough money to spend to keep it going. But no one wants safari or its derivatives. 

Everything else is chromium. And basically everyone’s choose these days that isnt safari or Firefox is a flavor of chromium. Most of the companies behind the chromium variants couldn’t afford to maintain chromium itself. I can only think Microsoft could afford it. And anyone who buys chrome should pour the same money that googles pours into chromium. Which they won’t. 

I am a Linux user. I’ll use Mac OS. I will use windows. I like the ability to choose a wide variety of tools. People should have that choice.; the list is here https://developer.apple.com/support/browser-choice-screen/; Nope, FF just sucks ass when it comes to a lot of more subtle things. For example, decoding RTC video streams is not hardware optimized whatsoever, crushed CPU compared to Chrome.; Browser is not browser engine. [Seems like the answer is yes, but only in the EU] (https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050478/apple-ios-17-4-browser-engines-eu). Finally... fuck Safari."

47,4 year returns for the graduating tech employee class of 2021,"Between August 2020 - December 2020, the big 5 tech companires -- AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, META did more interviews, hiring than their past 5 years combined. This cohort of tech employees are the ones that got the easiest interviews, and were able to uplift themselves into better companies even amongst themselves.

Interestingly, META was considered #1, AMZN and MSFT were considered tier 2 in this cohort of people.

I present to you the 4-year returns, because that's how tech world does compensation before you hit the cliff.

This means that someone who started their job on the first day of 2021 (assuming equity deposits, etc. happened the same way, they don't but just imagine), they should have gone to META and not AMZN.

Surprisingly GOOGL turned out to be the best bet in terms of volatility and performance. I can imagine META employees dumping their stock and not holding, GOOGL employees usually do auto sale, but the ones who kept it and didn't sell probably did well.

MSFT and AAPL employees also did well. Good times.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hlvfap/4_year_returns_for_the_graduating_tech_employee/,0,2024-12-25 07:34:30,"# **TLDR**

---

**Ticker:** GOOGL (with AAPL, MSFT close behind)

**Direction:** Up

**Prognosis:**  Buy and Hold (if you're a 2021 tech grad who got stock options).  META might have been the hottest hire, but GOOGL ended up being the best long-term investment.

**Meme-Worthy Observation:** META employees probably kicking themselves for not holding.; Bro, just put my crumbl cookie in the box; Ok.

So buy $GOOG CALLS.

48,Expensive Stocks vs Cheaper Stocks in Roth IRA,"Sorry in advance is this isn't allowed. Just trying to educate myself a bit more and this seemed like the best sub to ask this

Can someone give me advice on if it's better or worse to buy high priced stocks such as GOOG, APPL, JPM, COST, etc which are very high cost stocks vs cheaper stocks like WMT, CSCO etc. For context I am putting over 50% into SWPPX and SWLGX, I also have a pension and max out my Roth TSP, so I'm looking at my Roth IRA as more a place to be able to perhaps take more risk in it. I'm 41 and only just started my Roth IRA.

So my thinking is for example is it better to buy 2 shares of stock A at $200 per share or 8 shares of stock B at $50 per share, or no difference? I'm smart financially but not the best at stocks and in my brain it seems like stocks inherently have a ceiling and so lower stock of a strong company is better than higher stock of also a strong company.

TIA",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hlukn3/expensive_stocks_vs_cheaper_stocks_in_roth_ira/,3,2024-12-25 06:31:07,"Don’t pay attention to the price of the stock. Focus on the valuation and growth potential. Spend an hour or two on YouTube to educate yourself on this topic and make decisions for yourself since you considered yourself to be good financially.; No difference.; You are looking at share price to measure ""cheapness"". Look at P/E ratios.  
Similarly, you do not look at just the return % of assets. To select assets based on returns look at their Sharpe ratio.

Also, your invested capital matters. The number of shares you buy doesn't matter. You could be holding 1 stock of apple and share price increase by 5%. Your invested capital will also increase by 5%. 

Considering this. I highly recommend consulting a professional or sticking to ETFs like VOO, etc.; Price point's of a stock are irrelevant. It's valuation that matters.; What's better, a slice of 12"" pizza or a slice of 20"" pizza?; In my experience it is better to slightly overpay for a high quality stock then to underpay for a mediocre stock. Also the qualatative features of a company matters just as much if not more than the financials. If I overpay for a S tier company I will still beat inflation. 

Costco and MSFT are not cheap at the moment but if you look at every single S tier company you did very well if you bought at the peak of 2021.; I give two shits about the stock price I’m purchasing at. If it’s a 10 dollar stock or 500 dollars all that maters to me is the percent gain. You invest 10,000 on a low or high stock and return 25%, either way it’s 2500 in profit; If you have 10k your willing to invest that doesn’t matter too much definitely do some longer term expensive stocks ~100$-400$ range but if you don’t have that amount of capital I would recommend to invest in cheaper stocks but not too cheap like ~10$-50$ range for amortization couple thousand. Hold it for a couple years and pull out if they have seemed to of plateaued; It depends on your risk tolerance.

I woke up a few days ago and had lost $16,000 dollars because I have higher risk stock. .. Since then my portfolio has clawed back $12,000 of those $16,000. I stay focused on the fact that if I hadn't have invested in higher risk previously, then I wouldn't have had that $16000 as a percentage of my previous gains to lose.

Its all about risk tolerance and percentages, not cost of stocks.

I would rather make $1,000,000 on riskier stocks then lose $300,000 of that money than to make $400,000 with no loss on safer stocks ..over the same period of time.

It's all about your personal risk tolerance.; Buy funds not individual stocks for retirement. 

VOO and chill; The price doesn’t make a stock expensive the PE ratio is what makes it expensive compared to its peers. Do not get hung up on the actual price but the quality of the company.; I like your question, and most of the answers are great examples of traditional investing advice. I have a 401(k), a rollover, IRA, and a state pension… So I started a Roth IRA with the single intention of investing 8000 a year into the best high risk stocks that I can. It’s up 67% since August. I’m buying stocks under $20 that have high risk and high return, are often connected to things like AI and quantum computing. I’m staying away from biomedical because it often seems like all the eggs are in one basket, and RFK is unpredictable. The worst thing you can do is scroll through penny stocks, or WallStreetBets and emotionally attach to what people are saying. The best thing you can do is set up a system, where you understand the fundamentals, the trajectory for growth, get information from several sources, and understand how that company actually makes money. Good luck.; I feel the very low price stock are the risky, fun stocks that are almost like buying scratch lottery tickets and the more expensive, well known stock that took a long time to reach the price are safer but it will take a long time to make money.  So for a Roth, I would just keep dumping money in safe stocks or funds and not worry about it.  I would use “beer” money for the fun, risky stock.; the price of a share multiplied by the amount of shares makes up the market cap. NVIDIA was at 1000 earlier this year and did a forward split so 1 share became 10 and the price went from 1000 to 100. Market cap doesn't change and neither does your balance. 

Companies with smaller market cap have a cheaper upside. A 1 billion dollar company needs one more billion from investors to double the market cap and therefore the share price will 2x. the smaller the market cap the more volatile is the stock. A large cap company is generally more stable but PE like mentioned a lot is also very important. better buy ETFs and learn more buddy; Buy some shares of $MSTR.  Thank me when you turn 62.  

*This is not financial advice, and you should consult with a financial advisor.; [deleted]; I was thinking of maxing my Roth with either VOO, VTI, QQQ, or MAGS.  which one would you go with? This is over a 20 year span.; Is the angle of the cut the same?; I’m pretty sure that analogy doesn’t work in this case unless the slices are priced according to their size; For example, I will probably buy SOUN tomorrow, after I run through a series of checks. I once had a mini Cooper, moved to a Subaru, and noticed how upset I was about the voice recognition and talkback features. In my everyday life, including this phone right now, I’m dictating voice to text. There’s a lot of apps not getting it right, including Reddit. SOUN is the answer for this… But you still have to look at fundamentals.

Also, not giving financial advice, just as an example how to dig deeper into your purchases.; !Remindme in 6 months; Look at market cap instead of the share price. 

Using your example,

Let's say company A is $50/share
They have 1 billion shares. 
Market cap: $50 billion 


Company B is $200/share 
They have 1 million shares 
Market cap: $200 million 

Believe it or not, with these numbers company B ($200) has more room to grow. 

For company A to double their share price (50->100) they would need to add an additional $50 billion of value to the company. 

For company B to double their share price (200->400) they would need to only add an additional $200 million of value to the company. 

So even though company B has a higher share price, they have less friction to double their value.; Your understanding of stock price isn’t fully developed. The share price itself is irrelevant in comparison to another stock because they will have a different number of available shares. A $1000 can split to be $100 and you now have 10 shares at the exact same value. Additionally if you own 2 shares of a $50 or 1 share of a $100 and they both go up 20%, you’ve increased by the exact same amount of money. Like others have mentioned it’s the value and future expected strength of the company that’s important not the actual share price itself; I will be messaging you in 6 months on [**2025-06-25 06:51:31 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2025-06-25%2006:51:31%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hlukn3/expensive_stocks_vs_cheaper_stocks_in_roth_ira/m3pew0d/?context=3)

49,Potential AI stock? I would love to spot the next NVIDIA 🎄🧑‍🎄,"Merry Christmas, every investor heading to make the biggest profit!🎄🧑‍🎄

In the current secondary market, chips are no longer the most favored AI investment target. Instead, the spotlight has shifted to AI applications. The U.S. stock market's ""AI+"" trend is producing an increasing number of standout performers.

Recently, AI application stock $**Applovin (APP.US)** reached a new all-time high, with its stock price surging over 850% year-to-date and a market cap exceeding $100 billion, continuing to fuel the AI narrative. Meanwhile, **Palantir (PLTR.US)**, known for its ""AI+Defense"" focus, has also risen an impressive 318% this year.

According to Menlovc data, overall enterprise AI spending has grown from $2.3 billion last year to $13.8 billion this year. While foundational models remain the largest area of expenditure, spending on model deployment and application layers is accelerating at a faster pace.

Here are some potential stocks across various AI-related segments:

* **Software – Infrastructure**: $FTNT, $YEXT, $GTLB, $ADBE, $NTNX, $BOX, $ZS
* **IT Services**: $NET, $DOCN, $BASE, $MDB, $IT, $ACN, $SNOW

* **Commercial Services Providers**: $ACVA
* **Credit Services**: $MA
* **Software – Applications**: $QTWO, $ADSK, $DDOG, $DT, $CVLT, $CRM, $UBER, $WK, $AIFU, $NOW, $HUBS, $INTU

Yes yes they are already above 2 trillion. But here’s the thing: they have a forward P/E ratio of 21 while spending billions on ai development.

They are right there with OpenAI, but they look to be able to deliver it much cheaper, which will give them the upper hand. Add in quantum computing and self driving cars, two areas they are also leading in, and google is a steal right now. Other players in these areas are bleeding money. Google could very well become the first 10 trillion dollar company. It won’t happen this year, or next year. But I see Google beating the market for the next decade.

|-|-|-|-|; I’ve got some nice quantum chips I can let you have cheap. Please dm your cc info.; Temporary issue, may shoot up like SOUN did in the next 1-3 years. Partnerships are looking decent.; That should be fixed within the next year or so, the power of AI is being realised in the government so the contracts should be rolling in soon.; PDYN; Lots of DD out there, mini PLTR type company. Good management and lots of potential.; People are already accessing quantum computing through AWS and google cloud using IONQs computer for research. Not a novelty; this was the ai convo 15 years ago. its worth putting some in, even at an ETF if not specific to BBAI or other Quantum stock. easier market cap to reach; I think the calculating power is so big it defeats current encryption (passwords).

So they will be needed to create better encryption that can not be hacked by quantum computers.; I think BESI is working on the same thing and they already have a partnership with TSM on hybrid bonding.; Buy now. I grabbed some a few months ago.; We have an AI portfolio of 7 stocks that we will be buying in the dips until 2030. I think in a couple of years everyone will want in on NET.; What's wrong with ACHR? It seems to be doing pretty well. Military contacts, signed deal in Abu Dhabi, and price has been climbing slowly and holding. Went from like $4 to $15.; It's a mostly shitty product, that too many people build entire startups around without actually understanding what it does, what is it capable of and what it isn't. They are selling these insane and grand ideas to investors who do not understand it themselves, but are pouring money on it for crazy valuations. This is a bubble and it will burst.; Right?  Dude lists META, MA, and APPL as the next NVDA's lmao....I don't know if IRM will explode that huge, but data centers are needed more and more in a digital world.; Currently cheap AI with government contracts 😎; That’s ten minutes you could have been scrolling.; ‘Temporary issue’ 🙄; I don’t understand what that means. Do they have some commercial use? Are companies making money of the technology?; POET Technologies and Besi are quite different. POET focuses on using light to create super-fast data connections for AI and data centers, like building highways for information.   
  
In contrast, Besi makes the machines that assemble various computer chips for smartphones, cars, and more. While POET is still growing with its innovative ideas, Besi is an established company with a wide range of products.   
  
Both play important roles in technology but are working on different parts of the industry. ; Just grabbed a bit too. Let’s see where this goes; What's your portfolio?; Oh.... you must not look much at fundamentals.; I was in until you used the cool emoji 😑; Yes.
AWS (Amazon Web Services) engages with quantum computing through its Amazon Braket service, which provides a platform for exploring, experimenting, and developing quantum computing solutions. Here's how AWS uses quantum computers:


1. Amazon Braket Platform


Access to Quantum Hardware: Amazon Braket provides access to quantum computers from leading providers like D-Wave, IonQ, and Rigetti. Users can experiment with different quantum hardware technologies, including:


Superconducting Qubits: From providers like Rigetti.


Trapped Ions: From IonQ.


Quantum Annealers: From D-Wave, which specializes in optimization problems.




Simulators: For users without access to physical quantum computers, Braket offers classical quantum simulators to test and refine algorithms.




2. Hybrid Computing


AWS integrates classical and quantum computing to solve problems using hybrid algorithms, which use classical computation to assist quantum algorithms. This is particularly useful for tasks like optimization, machine learning, and material simulation.


3. Research and Development


AWS is investing in quantum research through the AWS Center for Quantum Computing:


Located in Pasadena, California, near the California Institute of Technology (Caltech).


Focused on advancing the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers.


Exploring breakthroughs in quantum algorithms and error correction.




4. Quantum Solutions for Industries


AWS helps businesses explore how quantum computing can address industry-specific challenges, such as:


Financial Services: Portfolio optimization and risk analysis.


Healthcare: Drug discovery and molecular simulation.


Logistics: Route optimization and supply chain management.




5. Education and Training


AWS offers resources, workshops, and tools to help users learn quantum programming using languages like PennyLane and Qiskit, and experiment with quantum circuits.


AWS’s approach focuses on providing access, resources, and tools to make quantum computing more accessible to researchers, businesses, and developers. While quantum computing is still in its early stages, AWS is positioning itself as a key player in building the infrastructure and ecosystem for its future applications.; Are apes?; BESI makes hybrid bonding tools that are mainly used to vertically stack chips to advance Moore's Law, but they are now using this technology to align fiber optics, which makes the alignment process more efficient. 

POET is trying to disrupt this process by incorporating fiber optics directly onto the chip to skip the alignment process all together. 

They are in direct competition. It's a matter of who can do it cheaper.; Let me ask you something. How much do you spend per year on financial services i.e. newsletter, conferences?; Well please elaborate, you're yet to answer my question.; Thanks ChatGPT.; Oh wow, I had no idea. Thank you for a great answer. Are there any applications for businesses or ""regular"" people yet?; Well its P/B ratio is in the 9s. It is trading completey on speculation and very high operating costs and the need to generate much more to stay operating. The price on these type of shocks does come back down to reality eventually.; Welcome. It's that easy. ; Something side related but shows you Amazons planning behind this. $52 Billion for new data centres across 3 States. Amazon have a $300 million feasibility study with Northwest Energy. Plan is to build 4 SMR Nuclear Small Modular Reactors with potential for 12. Northwest will own them, Amazon will get priority for energy for their  data centres.; No, you can't perform useful computations on a quantum computer today. The ideas and algorithms are there but the tech isn't (yet). We need more qubits and they need to be more stable; I’m regular.; Very interesting indeed. I""ve already nade bank on SMR and Oklo. Guess I gotta dtart looking seriously into quantum.; This. These stocks are rising but will fall back to earth temporarily when analysts look at their actual revenue. It's not there yet.; Do you think SMR and Oklo will continue to skyrocket? I’m thinking of buying some SMR/OKLO; I love their products and their numbers. I don’t wanna be the reason you lose money, but I'm gonna buy some more before the year's out. I'm using tight stop losses on both, though, as I expect them to continue to be volatile."

Got in with 100 at 23, watched it go down to 7ish and shut it out from my brain, didnt DCA, then watched it slowly climb back up to break even, and past, now at 80 with still 100 shares because I kept telling myself it will just go back down again; Wow , long term investing?  Are you Warren Ducking Buffet ?!!; *cue worlds smallest violin* 

At least you had the opportunity to buy AAPL at those levels in 2014. Some of us were in middle/high school at the time.; 10X but you put in nothing…
This is more disappointing than seeing that one guy go to $1M from nothing then tank back down again; Little by little a little becomes a lot; If you sell your position in Apple then you can afford to buy more of your next 14 bagger. But in all seriousness, whenever someone has a massive gain like this, they’ll always think “I wish I bought more” whether their initial investment was 1k or 100k. The only people who dont think that are the ones that had 100% of their portfolio invested.; For the time passed it's just not worth it. I know, profit is profit, but Sir... $23k profit in 11 years is nothing.

You could've bought 15 BTC and today you would be sitting at $1.4 million.; It's fake. RH wasn't around the time when AAPL was trading at $17. 😵‍💫; That's an old fucking bet!; You inherited that from nana?; butter than me. i never buy any lol; 12 years to make 23k, nice.

Not saying it’s bad but my god that’s a long term investment; Congrats! Well done.; just take the win, ffs; Why is this being upvoted?; That cost basis was too much even for r/investing; Mofo bough shares when Jesus was still walking the Earth; Nah, they just VOO and chill over at r/investing.; Make it 42069 shares; He sold 3 for Xmas; At this price?! /s; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); HA; [deleted]; Splits since 2012 are 28:1 on AAPL.  So that 97 shares in 2012 terms is 3.46 shares.  So OP obviously sold some shares along the way.  Should have held onto them!; Last time AAPL was that cheap was 2013. Not that long ago tbh. Or maybe I'm just getting old.; Still impressive to see that he bought Apple at $17 a share take a chill pill; He's been mulling around WSB now that he doesn't have Nana to talk to anymore.; Cause people are smart. Instead of blowing up their account with 0 DTE’s; Could’ve bought Tesla; I held from 17 and sold at 50. kicking myself now; This is the mental anquish I am currently going through with KULR.  I bought some at like 0.86 and sold at $1.37 to make a safe profit, then bought back in at $1.37 with 1200 shares, sold at $1.57 like a regard.  Watched it go up to almost 3 dollars that same day, and was kicking myself the whole way.  Could have gotten back in around 2 but was convinced it had reached the top for at least a while, now its at almost 5 and I'm wondering if I should get back in at $4.50 for a ten dollar run or wait for my $2.46 limit buy when it might be too late.  
TL;DR, I had the opportunity to make about 5k and sold with a ~250 gain.; This. Invested 100% of a rollover IRA and split it into 3 stocks, I am going to finally realize some of the Tesla gains during the run up to earnings end of Jan.  
https://imgur.com/a/0AjLRBd; RH has some nice incentives for transferring accounts; Technically, Robinhood as a company existed at the same time (mid-2013), but no one would have been trading with it.; Yeah no way thats DCA; I’m saying Apple ain’t been $17 since like 2012 😂 unc trading; Mispelled r/bogleheads; 69420; Facts; Not if you have tons of shares.; If you were old enough to buy stock 12 years ago you're certainly not in the ""youth"" category.; This is WSB; That's $1.4 Million in BTC back in 2013... today.; How is that impressive that just means he’s old

My bad for being 13 back then; Because this is like going on a sub for classic hot rods and posting a picture of your stock civic. 

There are a dozen other financial subs to post about your low cost average of Apple. Go post this shit there. This sub is for highly regarded option plays, massive losses/gains and ANOOS.; Aww; Could've bought hookers and blow; Could’ve bought Bitcoin the same year😅; You think Tesla will keep going up until earnings?; 17 DCA maybe after split and sold a bunch best I can figure; This guy gets it.; [removed]; In the big 2024 and we still have grown men making 69 and 420 jokes😪; [deleted]; Now get off my lawn.; Thanks man cause I’m totally incapable of reading; I did, well I bought the beers and the hotel room, the hookers brought the ass and coke after work; Misspelled “this guy bogles”; Of course he does...he is a ""Top 1% Commenter""; Well jokes on them. I’ve bought Boeing, Intel, super micro computer, cava all at the top. All are down double digits. 

So now I’m buying VOO and QQQ. Those smug assholes better be ready for a market correction.; Index investing is good for people who aren't able to comprehend the market. We need those boring people, without them the market makers wouldn't have the cash to short the fuck out of a company so we have something to bet against.

When i went to show my gf my gainz i saw THE ORDER DIDNT FILL AND I STILL HAVE IT. FUCK MY LIFE; I think it worked out for you, this week gonna be a crazy Santa rally based off todays performance imo; Rip 40 hours of theta; Probably the best decision you made today; For sure Apple hitting that by EOW.; No worries just do it tomorrow. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31226); Dude. Hold. Theyre taking on the DoJ. Get ur popcorn; Bruh; Definitely don’t sell you’re 100% landing that mark and more probably.; Oooooof. Hopefully you get a green candle to fight theta decay.; AAPL is stupidly overvalued. Good luck.; [deleted]; Damn, TSLA had that run right to the end today too. I know cause I had $475 calls that did nothing all day until the last 30 mins. Went from no gain to 170% with that move.; That sentence makes it drop; yup we’re seeing red thursday; Market is closed, but Wendy is open. I’m about to go get a job application real quick.; Ye it was a careless mistake on my part, another tuition fee i guess.; how do people know this; hopefully we see some red in the quantum stocks. that shit so overpriced its hilarious. Shit a tape drive company shot up like 4000% because they had ""quantum"" in their name.; How much will you actually lose until 26th?; They reach deep deep inside their butts and pull the information out.; Will find out on the 26th 💀; Just calculate it no? Assuming same price stays the same calculating theta decay is not that hard.


I mean it's literally 30 seconds if you use an option price calculator; You will lose theta but I think you will stay green; This whole idea of Theta being active when the stock market is closed feels criminal. They need to find a way to suspend Theta on days like this. Doesn’t even feel right; Will see a drop with theta, but i think you will be fine if not green by the end of the day. Tech stocks are holding us up this week. AAPL being one of them. I can see this printing🤞"

Its just like buying any other shares its just a stock, like buying SPY shares for example. You can day trade it or hold it up to you. Lemme know if that answers your question. (Keep in mind if TSLA were to go down 10% then TSLL would go down 20% obviously so thats why it’s riskier).; thanks. i read something about how leveraged products “decay” over time, i think due to the price resetting or something? but maybe that is entirely different.; Decay is a very real thing with leveraged ETFs: https://www.moomoo.com/community/feed/the-decay-risk-of-investing-in-multi-fold-leveraged-etfs-111742762024970; People use the word decay out of ignorance.

Daily compounding is the thing that causes increasing effects, up or down.

https://www.wisdomtree.eu/fr-fr/-/media/eu-media-files/users/documents/4211/short-leverage-etfs-etps-compounding-explained.pdf; thanks, so what i am wondering is: if decay is something to avoid, and to avoid decay you want to avoid holding overnight, then is there a risk of being able to exit the holding at end of day at an idea price (as why would somebody buy the ETF off you near end of day)?; Isn't that decay though?

Because the % change is multiplied, there is more downside than upside. Not sure how to describe this well... but let's say you hold for 2 days, with a % change after each. Moving a fixed amount (say 10%) down from $100 of principal (original value) towards 0% of principal (thus $90) on day 1 is ""worse"" than moving that same amount above 100% (to $110) because the relative change required on day 2 to return to $100 increases asymptotically as value held after day 1 approaches $0 (-100% loss on day 1). Because +1% is not as ""good"" as -1% down is ""bad"", the fact that a flat multiplier (3x) is applied to the % change means that the magnification skews towards negative effect in net.

As an example, if your principal is $100 and you take a -10% loss your 1X = $90, 3x = $70.
From here, to return to $100 you need a +11% gain for the $90, but a +43% gain on the $70. If you get that +11% gain on the 1X, you'll only get a +33% gain on the 3X which means your principal is restored on the 1X but not on the 3X.

This is not better in reverse. If instead you gain +10% your 1X = $110, 3X = $130. It takes a -9% loss to return $110 to $100, and a -23% loss to return $130 to $100. This means a -7.7% loss will undo all your gains on the 3X, but you'll still be ahead on the 1X.

The effects are much smaller with lower percentages (like a more realistic +-0.5% per compounding period) but it's directionally the same. In the extreme, the effect scales up - to the point where a 33% loss on the 1X will completely wipe you out on the 3X.

That's why it ""decays"" and trends towards net loss any time there is a directional change (volatility). It's only when you have relatively consistent gains that the magnification can scale up / accelerate. Volatility is to be expected on most timescales, so these leveraged ETFs can be very useful for certain functions but are nearly guaranteed to trail the index they track over longer time periods in a sufficiently volatile market, especially when considering fees. Originally thought it wasn't suitable for long time periods, but after checking some performances they *can* perform very well over longer time periods depending on the market and timing.; Liquidity and tax drag are the bigger concerns.; I’m not even close to being well-versed on leveraged ETFs, so I’d suggest asking your questions on the LETF subreddit. r/investing is pretty much all VOO and chill.; \-the word decay out of ignorance

See that's the thing. The word decay doesn't have any meaning. People throw it around without any explanation.

You went through and calculated it very carefully, gave it meaning and knowledge. That's a big difference.

TQQQ and a few similar ones are the only ones that have produced high long term returns. 99% of the rest are huge losses.; And decay and high fees."
54,"When Tech Eventually Fizzles, Will U.S. Continue to Dominate? Backtesting Excluding Tech vs. Global Markets","Edit: People are misunderstanding the question. I’m not bearish on tech. It’s more of a question of US continuing to out perform the global market once the expected returns on tech slows.

TL;DR: As tech’s strong performance fades (maybe it doesn’t, but eventually, it might), why should we believe the U.S. market will continue to outperform globally? Has anyone already backtested the S&P 500 excluding tech—especially the “Magnificent 7”—and compared its performance to developed and emerging markets?

Over the past 15 years, the U.S. market has massively outperformed global equities, leading to the narrative that U.S. governance, monetary policy, the strength of the dollar (as the global reserve currency), and favorable geopolitical conditions will continue to support this dominance. This view is widely accepted in this community (you can find tons of discussions on this by searching “international” here if you haven’t already).

However, the primary driver of U.S. outperformance has been the tech sector, particularly the “Magnificent 7” (Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Google, Amazon, Tesla, and Meta). A quick search shows that these companies have been responsible for a significant portion of U.S. market returns over the past two decades, with tech alone contributing heavily to the growth of the S&P 500.

But what happens when the tech sector eventually hits a slowdown or correction? While it could continue to dominate for another decade, at some point, the market may shift, and another sector or region could rise to prominence. So, if tech (especially the Magnificent 7) loses its edge, what is left to support U.S. market dominance?

I’m particularly interested in whether anyone has backtested the S&P 500 excluding tech stocks (especially the MAG 7) and compared its performance against global markets—both developed and emerging. Excluding the top tech names from the S&P 500 could provide a more realistic view of the underlying market performance without the distortion caused by these mega-cap stocks, which are arguably overvalued or at least priced for significant future growth.

I’m asking this because, as a long-term, passive investor, I think the MAG 7 may be overvalued, and their strong returns over the past 15 years might not be sustainable. To further diversify my portfolio, I’ve begun investing in US mid and small-cap S&P funds, but I’m also looking to increase my exposure to global equities. From what I can see, excluding tech from the equation, international equities don’t appear to underperform as much relative to U.S. stocks. So, I’m interested in seeing if global diversification, especially in emerging markets, would still yield solid returns after this adjustment.

A few questions I have:
Has anyone conducted a backtest or analysis of the S&P 500’s performance excluding the Magnificent 7? How does it compare to global markets, particularly developed and emerging markets?

If tech returns eventually fizzle out (or at least grow more slowly), should we expect the U.S. to continue outperforming? What other sectors or factors might drive U.S. market growth in the future?

I’ve prepared myself for critical feedback—Drag me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hkr1z4/when_tech_eventually_fizzles_will_us_continue_to/,0,2024-12-23 17:12:33,"Commenting to see the updates. I am a firm believer that the US market growth will continue to dominate and grow with time, i think that the USA has this innovation mentality and a stock market mentality very different from others markets that plays a big role in its performance; Unless I’m missing something, you haven’t presented a bear case for big tech beyond “it could happen.” Personally I’m betting on humanity continue to grow increasingly reliant on tech and wealth continuing to consolidate.; Bruh, the US is about the innovation, always progressing, always pivoting. Stop overthinking things. ; I feel that a backtest that excludes the best performers tells you very little because almost *all* return of the overall market have come from a minority of best performers that compensated for everyone else being pretty bad. Here is research that shows this since 1926. [https://wpcarey.asu.edu/department-finance/faculty-research/do-stocks-outperform-treasury-bills](https://wpcarey.asu.edu/department-finance/faculty-research/do-stocks-outperform-treasury-bills)

I hold market cap int'l btw.; Because Europe is lazy (IE they don't want to work 70 hours per week), Japan still uses fax machines and is too prideful to overcome the sunk cost falacy that happens to all emerging tech, China is not yet innovative enough but they are very close, although their tech will largely stay in China because it will mimic US tech, not lead it, Africa is Africa, the middle east doesn't have the talent, and Central and South America don't have the money or the drive. So yeah, the US will continue to outperform, slightly, when it comes to tech for the next 10-30 years.; Tech is science; it will only accelerate, not “fizzle.”; The U.S. will always have McDonalds and the Quarter Pounder, baby (Royale with Cheese in Paris).   There’s Coca Cola, though internationalized, etc.. There’s a lot of non-US brands and even some international brands that sell different models in the U.S./Canada; example: Toyota, via its “North American” subsidiary didn’t sell the plain “Hi-Lux” pick up in the U.S. until very recently but offered it to the rest of the world.   Brands will continue to be strive to be global just due to more customers, .. using their college trained workforces to skirt undue tariffs, and consumer tastes (and perhaps restrictions?) will be most vital. 

Tech wise the U.S. has had an advantage piggybacking off its relatively large defense budgets (all U.S. degreed engineers must complete 4 classes of calculus post-Sputnik scare for example after the late 1950s) and a relatively free society, ..  not sure that’ll really change.   Despite seemingly backtracking on education, the defense industry and more thoughtful minds in Congress know about drones, AI, robotics, etc.. 

What seems to be happening though is with mid-level engineering, it’s pretty much China and India as powerhouses.   There’s also the physical facilities, but what role does better automation play in that? 

Anyways to complete my story, in Paris they still call a Big Mac a Big Mac but they call it Le Big Mac (*Pulp Fiction* reference).  Entertainment will still be big from the US too, but some subtitled (for Americans) films have won big in the Oscars.; I think the market will crash a bit but I don’t think it’ll be any different than a normal crash. The mag 7 companies are all(or mostly all) working on some pretty game changing stuff. I foresee a lot more growth to come.; All S&P 500 companies are tech companies. A company like Dominoes has dominated for a long time because of their use of technology in ordering, delivering and the cooking process. You either use tech or you go out of business and, in order to use tech, you need tech people or the ability to outsource it. You may have an inherent competitive advantage if you can build it yourself though.

You could say that energy is not tech but we have the shale revolution which was a technological revolution.; OP is correct that US over-performance is mostly due to tech sector, which is arguably over valued and over-hyped by most metrics. But having said that, every 3 years or so, the next new thing is going to pop up. Now its AI for example.

US seems to dominate in tech ""innovation"".  Taiwan is player with semis. Japan and europe are players. But the US is the locomotive engine at the front of the tech train, for good or bad. Many US tech companies crash and burn, but the survivors become the global leaders in tech.

Can ""emerging market"" like India be major player in tech?  I dunno not specialist in that part of the India market. If or when that happens then it happens. Change is constant..; If for whatever reason another sector like energy takes favor over tech , china, India and other energy producers could out perform; Where else is there to go anyway if you don’t believe in the USA anymore? Europe? China? Japan? 

I’d argue if the USA stalls, so will everyone else.; US tech is global, anyways, and that's amidst a world that's becoming more connected than ever before. The companies also have immense capital available, or the ability to out-leverage almost anyone smaller that's a threat. Anything new that's promising will just be acquired by US tech companies and rolled into the portfolio.

As wealth increases globally and emerging markets/international demographics have growing access to US tech, that's what they'll choose (both products and investing). US tech products are high in demand globally, even those that are relatively expensive domestically (e.g. Apple products).

People are obviously free to invest in whatever they want and try to ""diversify"" as much as they want, but unless something radical happens (which would result in global economic pain anyways), US (and particularly US tech) will continue to dominate.; Don't forget: ""this time it's different!"" ;-)

IT guy since the 90's here. I wish there was a way to make money off the teach fizzling predictions over the years.; Tech has in the past bet big on things that failed. The field is littered with tech stars that no longer exist. Currently tech is spending huge amounts on “AI”, but the demand for those products isn’t there, which means profits may suffer. Will that happen, it’s hard to say, but betting on tech in its current state is definitely risky. 

If you want a sober counterpoint to the tech hype, check out Ed Zitron’s writing. https://www.wheresyoured.at/. Not saying he’s 100% correct, but to be an informed investor you need to look at a wide variety of inputs (also true in politics…) 

Another often-pessimistic opinion on tech topics worth considering is Cory Doctorow. https://pluralistic.net/

I personally have a big stake in tech, I’ve worked my entire life in tech, but again, just because it’s been doing great doesn’t mean it will keep going like that indefinitely.; Tech as a sector hasn’t always been a top performer until recently 
https://novelinvestor.com/sector-performance/; With that logic I should just QQQ and chill; This is exactly what I am saying. Once another sector carries the market like energy,materials, or industrials does the US market continue to out perform?; All fair points, but maybe my question wasn’t clear. What happens when expected returns for tech stabilize, growth flattens, and  another sector takes favor? If the US market is propped up by tech, will it continue to out perform?; Idk, visiting China makes me feel like the US is the one that's behind, not China. Sure we may rush out MVPs for services, but it feels like China took most of our techs and infrastructure and completed it.; Don’t know why you’re being downvoted. This is very correct.; Maybe fizzle is the wrong word, but it it is arguably overvalued priced and has lower expected returns. Another sector will eventually come into favor.; lol Atleast one person agrees; Exactly! I’m European and I’m not investing a single buck in Europe. China will for sure grow and become even more a giant as it is today but it doesn’t mean the Chinese stock market will do so as well. India can be promising too but I have no knowledge on this market and it doesn’t mean thqt its stocks will have a bright future either.; Literally the only informed comment on this thread. I was hoping for deeper discussion than “nothing can stop US Innovation”; ….because it wasn’t always a top earner. Now it is. It’s seriously not rocket science.

And do you see people wanting *fewer* IPhones, smart TV’s, and video games? I don’t.; Think what has the most potential for future growth, what do we rely on to improve our quality of life, what are the current challenges we face and what we are doing to solve them.; You should

“When tech fizzles” lmao.. zoom out man; ? I'm not agreeing with you, I'm trying to argue against a backtest that excludes the Mag7. Excluding best performers from a backtest makes no sense; Because that is not how asset pricing works.


Everyone knows what he said and equities are priced accordingly. US is priced as this perfect market with perfect companies, any misstep will result in very steep valuation adjustments. On the other hand, Europe/China are priced at negative growth by the market, all they need is to show up and will probably outperform.; I think people are misunderstanding my question. They think I am bearish tech, but what the question really revolves around is US outperforming the global market in the future.; Not sure I agree. There has been a recent sudden acceleration in the field of generative AI that appears to be “stabilizing” (perhaps a euphemism for slowing down ☺️), but overall, I believe the technology sector will always continue to grow unless some kind of catastrophic event occurs or government policy begins to hinder it.; I’ve personally experienced things that can stop US innovation, and the biggest factor is greed. I worked for a startup that had a decent offer to get bought, the founders turned it down because it wasn’t enough $, the company folded the year after. 

Doctorow writes about the endless need for growth causing products to get exponentially worse. The word he coined to describe this was recognized in 2024 as a “word of the year”: https://www.techspot.com/news/105733-rise-enshittification-officially-word-year.html; My question revolves around out performance once it isn’t a top earner anymore..; No place on earth outside of the US encourages, let alone achieves, any semblance of innovation. That is in relation to tech, or any other industry for that matter.; Agreed, but to expected returns / Stock price continue to grow as fast as other sectors in the future?; “Unless some kind of catastrophic event occurs”… 
catastrophes do occur on a semi-regular basis. Some of them are predictable, others less so. In fact, government policy toward tech is about to change dramatically, in less than a month.; A similar sentiment was shared in 1999 about the internet….at some point, valuations do matter and stock price growth can’t rely on multiple expansion.

Too many big tech names have valuations well beyond their 10-year averages; Thank you for sharing; Yep, Trump and his anti-science nutjobs are gonna tank the economy. This is exactly the kind of catastrophic event I was referring to 😉"
55,I fixed my $4.15MM account deficit. Be aware of the risk of option early assignment.,"**Outcome**

At 9:45AM ET on Monday (12/23/2024), my $4.12MM account deficit issue has been fixed.

I lost $8200 because my put credit spread become worthless.

I got my $4.12MM debit back.

**Previous post with all context**

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hjh68x/4\_million\_account\_deficit\_due\_to\_option\_early/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hjh68x/4_million_account_deficit_due_to_option_early/)

**Timeline**

00:01 AM ET, 12/21, on Saturday (Friday midnight): I got RH notifications that I got early assignments on my short put positions. I had to buy 3300 SPY and 4900 DIA shares, which led to the $4.12MM deficit issue in my RH account.

Saturday (12/21): I shared my situations on Reddit. Thanks the Reddit community. I learned a ton about this complex option event and risk management. I was very stressful still.

Sunday (12/22): reviewed and replied to hundreds of comments on my Reddit post. Looking for the best strategy or solution. Be prepared to handle on Monday morning.

Around 11:30PM ET, RH system queued my 33x SPY and 49 DIA puts for exercise automatically without my consent. I chatted 2 times with the RH agents via the RH app. They responded quickly, shared basic information, but did not help that much because they don't have the same access as the folks in RH risk or operation team. I tried to cancel the queued order by myself, but the RH app disallow me to do so. I was planning to handle my positions manually on Monday morning but this restriction did not provide me any choices. So I go back to sleep.

Monday morning (12/23): I waked up at 8:30am ET, called RH human agent over the phone at 9:20am ET, waited 5 minutes and talked to the agent at 9:25am ET. He explained that the RH system will make best strategy to reduce the loss when closing positions for customers. He confirmed that there is a little extrinct value left in the puts. Exercise is the best option here, so the system schedule to exercise automatically.

Finally, my 33x SPY puts and 49x DIA puts were exerised (3300 SPY shares were sold at strike price $607, and 4900 DIA shares were sold at strike price $444).

At 9:45AM ET on Monday (12/23/2024), my $4.12MM account deficit issue has been fixed.

**Take aways**

Early assignment: If you short any options, you have the obligation for early assignment. The option buyers have the rights to exercise options at any time, which selling their corresponding shares to you. If you don't have enough fund in your account, you will borrow margin to buy shares.

Vertical spread: RH app shows the max gain and max loss when you trade vertical spreads. It works most of time, but in reality, we could lost more due to early assignment, margin borrow, wide price spread, hard to close due to insufficient liquility. Take consider of all the possibilities.

Index option: Just learned about index options like SPX. It is european-style option which will not have early assignment and always settle in cash.

Interest rate of borrow margin with early assignment: RH generously waived all the interest occured by early assignment. So I do not need to pay any extra interest for this. Early assignment is out of user's control.

Dividends when short an option: Lots of folks saying that we may need to pay the dividends if the short option position is ITM and on ex-dividend date. This is really complicated and vary case by case. I could confirm vertical spreads do not have anything to do with this. Don't worry too much if you have long/short the option at the same time.

Option exercise: it is funny that my options were exercise at 9:30AM when the market opened on Monday. OCC could only settle the request in the midnight after the market close at 5:30PM ET. RH has an internal system, which they processed the order internally first.

About RH: To be honest, RH has been improved a lot. Their customer support was responsive. They picked the least risky strategy closing positions and waived the margin interest for early assignemnts.

Finally, I want to thank you all the redditors who have replied, helped, and blessed me on this drama thing. We are good to enjoy the holidays now.

The numbers look impressive. But this is basically, max loss...

Your trade was busted right when $JPOW started talking, and no broker could have changed that...; See, this is why keeping your port really small is the best strategy.; Legit hopes this helps other regards be less regarded; I have, no fucking idea what any of this means. I just see big number; The brokerage should pay you a fee for protecting their capital.; Dude, trade SPX. Cash settled so no assignment risk. Also more favorable tax treatment. 

Use XSP for smaller contract size. 

Glad it worked out for you; No one will learn anything from reading your post including you.  You will keep selling option spreads.; glad you came out ok!; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640) whats this?; if you lost 8200$ , why do you put the ""GAIN"" tag ?; If my math is right, the max you were supposed to lose was 3300+4900=8200 minus the credit you received when you sold these credit spreads, isn't it?

But due to early assignment you had a margin debt on which interest was charged, how much was it?

I feel like this was RH shenanigan to earn interest from you. I notice that those SPY puts still have around $0.20 left each contract, that's like $660 for those 608 calls. RH can simply eat the premium cost if it offsets the interest earned, because I do not understand why anyone else would exercise a option contract which still has premium left, they lose money.

  
On second thought, impossible to know the real premium of those puts without doing a trade since the spread is wide.; Serious question: can I use this strat to impress a girl with huge numbers in RH account over a weekend for 1 night stand?

My NPC convo is ""I am rolling millions with a tip of my fingers, loook at me"". I mean.... big number is a big number. Outside of this sub, having something something millions (even in red) and then ""successfully"" resolving it does ring ""smart nerd""  vibe.; RH best strategy to rectify the situation would most likely have you at a loss. I had a similar situation with TSLA on think or swim. Had the whole plan setup with calculations. TD risk management locked me out of the positions and refused to allow for my plan to be executed. My plan would have net me over $100k in profit and their ""best plan"" ended up with me breaking even. Needless to say it was very frustrating to watch their automated system execute terrible trades.; This is why I will never do anything with options that isn’t in my control. People do not understand the complexities of options trading. If you asked them what the difference between euro options and US options was (which is extremely relevant to OPs situation) they’ll have no clue.; *You okay dude?*; You are regarding with this much amount?; Hate when that happens; Can they waive your RH Gold too?; [deleted]; Thanks for the update OP. I’m sorry that happened. I know it’s a lot of money for you.; you held shorts ITM on dec MOPEX 

I once had this happen on etrade, woke up to $600k deficit because i was long some shares of spy 

luckily SPY tanked and I covered and made some cash 

but then I had to pay the dividend 

wait until you have to pay the dividend too; OP: when did you first learn about option exercise and assignment?  

You may also wanna read op on euro-style vs american-style options.; I live in europe. You guys are crazy, and yor options are ridiculous. We have cfd. Its easy. Why there are no cfds in usa ?; Could you explain the vertical spread lack of need to worry about dividend assignment?  I know having short calls on ex div can be risky but how does it work on a spread ?; When I owe the broker 4 million, that’s their problem 😂; Next time, bet on SPX index option lol; 100% seriousness - theoretical outcomes aren’t what always happens with options.  Too many calculate values at expiration and everything that happens in the middle can dramatically change the economics.

Be careful out there people.  Be especially careful with short options.; IBKR just liquidates my put contracts at 3:56 PM. A whole diff story; Glad you solved your problem, but this isn't drama. This is literally how spreads work. Do NOT trade options strategies you know nothing about. Better yet, stop trading options. Especially if you can't be bothered to learn.

Options are ALWAYS auto exercised on the morning AFTER the expiry if they expire in the money.  
Your consent isn't needed for them to auto exercise the options when it's THEIR millions of dollars on the line, and not yours. Because if you screw it up, you'll never pay it back and you'll file for bankruptcy, leaving them out the money. Trying to cancel the orders that RH auto put in to save yourself a couple thousand  because you think you can manually manage risk better than they can is arrogant and irresponsible.

You need to delete your account, or at least pause it while you learn more about your gambling.

EDIT: early assignment is absolutely in your control. The control? DO NOT SELL THE CONTRACT if you're not willing to take on the costs of early assignment. The control you have is when you pressed the trade button when really you should have punched yourself in the dick.; [deleted]; Kind of ridiculous that Robinhood hasn’t fixed this yet. Surprised there aren’t more of these.; Natural selection took place.
20yo is not a kid. You are old enough to vote, enlisted, etc

Downloading the app, Playing with a product u don't understand well enough, and not bothering to learn the basics.
Then, when shitz happen, how about thinking whether the numbers make sense, and perhaps clarify/call up RH like what the OP did. 

So many steps along the way, he can stop to think and make the smarter choice in just one step and things will turn out much better.; I'll never trade credit spreads, it's not worth it giving up intrinsic value for premium and facing spread loss no way; what about 1700?; You can do spreads with small accounts. With just $1k in your account, could open a single TSLA spread right now that would display a $45k deficit on early assignment.



And at no point was OP actually $4 million in the hole. He was covered by the other leg of his spreads. Robinhood just displays early assignment in a really stupid way.; I knew I wasn’t mooning my portfolio for a reason; My dude learned a lot about options... with $4.2 million in play... would make Dr Evil blow his load; Too many word, too few rockets and even less moons. I assume OP is a gei ber and wanted to be assfckd, but he wasn't.; Same here and I don’t know why I even read these posts.  For me it’s buy stock, stock do good or stock do bad.; Same, brother.

Someone explain it like we’re two, please.; > Use XSP for smaller contract size.  
  
I only knew about $SPX, but this is much more in my comfort zone. Thanks!; So you sell puts on SPX without having the collateral cash?; Credit spreads are fine.; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); LOL I missed that! They did it because they only lost that and not 

>I got my $4.12MM debit back.

\-$8,200 is closer to a gain than -$4,120,000 they felt they lost.; what about 1700 in credit spread?; You can show her a paper trading account; I bet it has to do with money; Market opens at 9:30 ET fam… however I completely agree with all of your other points lol OP is a knob; It was a credit spread so you short position cover the long position and you only need difference of both leg as collateral. So for a put credit spread if you choose 580/575 strike rate you will only need 500 per contract; Room temp IQ take right here folks ^^^


OP had zero clue what he was doing or trading. The whole point of a credit spread is to mitigate risk when selling options. The 'sell to open' leg of the contract is your money maker, your bread and butter (Theta gangs take; we all know they're just picking up pennies in front of a steam roller) 


The 'buy to open' leg of the contract is your protection in case your short leg (the sell to open contract that you're trying to make money off of) expires ITM. 


Anyone who read the post who has basic working knowledge of credit spreads knew OP was going to be fine. How did we know this? Because his long leg of the contracts (the buy to open one) was his protection against being on the hook for millions of dollars that he does not have. He would lose his premium 'collected' and whatever was being held as collateral. 


If he got assigned on a Friday, how do you expect anything to happen over the weekend? Markets are closed, can't trade shares or do anything until Monday morning. 


This is a simple case of OP simply not knowing what the fuck he was doing. He saw the assignment and panicked, not understanding what the purpose of the long leg of the contract is for. 


Pin-risk is where the real potential for excitement comes from with spreads. Doesn't apply to early assignment though. 


TLDR: OP is a fuckin moron and so is the guy im replying to, probably more than OP tbh; There’s nothing to fix here. Maybe the fix is not let people sell spreads when they don’t understand the risk.; Nothing's broken, this is literally how spreads work. Until the long side of the spread is closed, the balance is negative. What needs fixing is giving every regard a margin account.; They don't have you agree you understand all this before allowing you to do all this? That's definitely criminal, just sue them!; How RH is still in business after shit they pull is beyond me.; Yeah, you definitely didn’t make any mistakes at 20. Jesus Christ. This is the most callous, reddit-coded comment I’ve seen all day.; I understood the first 5 words of this.; I’m so old mooning means something different to me.; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|53057); feed to chatgpt and ask for ELI5; Personally, I sell credit spreads. That is risky if you are not careful. I have the cash collateral to cover the spread risk. I will risk up to 10% of my portfolio at a time.; No.; I can shoe her my monopoly money too; Because I didn't understand the words that you assembled together up there, I take that to mean I should stay away from that kind of shit.

No sir. None of that for me. I'll just lose money the simple way: By buying way out of the money calls hoping for some massive green erection to save me from decay.; This guy tradez; Not sure how anything I said makes you think I don't understand how credit spreads work but ok, go on, king.; I’m new to trading and have no idea what this means at all…. could you perhaps be so kind to dumb it down for me?

You were playing a game where you promised to buy something (like stocks) at a certain price if someone else wanted to sell it to you. This is called ""selling options."" However, in this case, the person who bought from you decided to make you buy those things (stocks) earlier than you expected, and you didn’t have enough money in your account to do so. This caused a big money problem, a $4.12 million hole in your account.

Luckily, the company you were using to trade (Robinhood) helped fix the issue. They automatically processed the trade for you and didn’t charge you extra fees. You lost a bit of money because of the way things happened, but the big deficit was resolved by the end of the day.

In short: When you sell options, the person who buys them can ask you to do something sooner than expected, and if you’re not ready for that, it can cause a big mess. Robinhood helped you clean it up without charging extra fees.

  
Oh, the wonders of the new dystopian world we live in.; Such a great idea. Thanks!; Are you selling 0DTE? How much credit are you netting, mind sharing a sample spread to look at?; That's okay dude. Credit spreads aren't as scary as they seem but they do require you to have decent understanding of how options work. 


You're not an idiot if you don't understand how credit spreads work. You're an idiot if you don't know how credit spreads work, lie and say you do, and then go and on post on the internet that your position has gone tits up because you got assigned, while still having your protection.


Again, the real scariness comes with pin-risk, which I would be extremely surprised if that could even happen on robinhood nowadays. ; King right here.. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)![img](emote|t5_2th52|31226); Amd shares got it; This was actually my conclusion.

You blame robinhood like they had anything to do with this. OP gets assigned on a Friday. Obviously going into the weekend he is going to have a negative balance. He can't exercise his long legs or sell the shares he was assigned. How do you do that on a Saturday or a Sunday?????


It's on OP for not knowing what the other half of the contract is for. Robinhood did nothing wrong here other than display the data as is. I can tell you from experience that it would have been the same thing from any other broker. If you get assigned on a Friday, and your contracts don't expire on that same Friday you get assigned, you're going into the weekend with some scary numbers. Not a cause for panic, unless you're a regard for not knowing what you're doing. 


That idiot who offed himself brought a lot of negative attention to trading when he committed suicide. And it was all due to his own stupidity. Clearly it was before your time in the market 


YOU fail to hold those accountable for their own actions. You literally say robinhood hasn't 'fixed this' yet, like they have anything to fix to begin with. Didn't know robinhood had a special pill for stupid

The toxicity, and especially the self-humility, of WSB once used to moderate this place. Im probably being a little hard on u/jackiemoontothemoon cuz he's a reborn ape that's spewing handholding-nanny like shit that ruined WSB after the whole 🌈ME saga (regards blaming hedgies and Ken and Vlad (of robinhood) instead of themselves for their dumb trades like it used to be) 


The toxicity isn't as fun and the self-humility is mostly gone. Saying shit like 'I can't believe robinhood hadn't fixed this yet' helps perpetuate the fallen state of WSB; I’m new too and no idea what’s going on.

I thought about selling off some holdings but the taxes will hurt me since I don’t make a lot.  Someone suggested I use Margin loans and hold onto my holdings.   I’m on Merrill edge so it looks like my rate will be around 13.13 APY.   That’s a lot to me.  Seems like margin loans are primarily used for short term gains, and Im not a short term guy.

Just pay it imo.; Just pay your taxes it's not a big deal. You don't have to sell everything at once either.; Respectfully, you’re nowhere near the amount of capital required to buy borrow die

If you’d prefer to pay less taxes, just wait for the stock price to go down or crash so you have no profit to pay taxes on 

If that sounds stupid, that’s because it is. Just pay the damn taxes. It’s like asking for a lower paycheck to pay lower taxes; Just keep it simple. If you’re ready to sell then sell. Financial chicanery usually never works out. Talk to a accountant instead of Reddit as well; Classic case of tax tail wagging the dog. Look up what your income limits are and sell under that if you're trying to sell under that and pay little in taxes.

Taxes are sometimes a good problem to have (e.g. you made money). Tax code is preferential to long term gains, so really, you're realizing most of what you earned (i.e. you're not going to lose 50% to Uncle Sam).

In other words: just sell and pay a few bucks in taxes if it comes down to it. You have the advantage of timing right now in that a new tax year starts in a week.; If you make 40k you can realize about 20k in gains a year without paying any tax. If I were you I'd sell the least profitable stocks that realize 30k of gains (go over a bit to make sure you use all 0% and just pay 15% on a little extra) now, and again in January for 2025. ; Sell and just save some for taxes.. it's thar simple. Don't try to find the loopholes. You aren't a hedge fund; If you’re up that much just pay the taxes 😂😂; Is your hope that the stocks go down so you pay less taxes?; Capital gains tax is only 15%, just sell and pay it off. Not worth the risk of having a loan; That’s a crazy margin rate though. There are others much less e.g. Interactive Brokers.

Margin only makes sense if you think you can make more in stock appreciation and dividends than the margin rate. 

Plus, it is a risky move to plan on using margin over a long-term. You don’t know future interest rates, and you don’t know the future of the market.

If you sell a modest amount for living expenses, I don’t understand how the taxes would hurt you that much - **especially** if you are only making 40 K, and also if you are selling long-term holdings. 

Please talk to a tax advisor.; If you are wanting to sell vs continuing to
Hold, then sell in early 2025, set aside the money you’ll Owe in capital gains taxes in a HYSA and pay the taxes in 2026 when they’re due.; Your taxes aren’t worse because you don’t make a lot. You have everything backwards. Just sell & pay.; Just set aside enough to pay the extra taxes; I wouldn't, what you can do though is start slowly taking capital gains. So you're up 12x your annual salary more or less. That's a big amount of money. Look at where your tax rates will be. Start taking long-term capital gains in portions and maximize your tax rates, roll money into the s&p 500. 

You've already had extremely outsized returns from these individual companies. If you did a back test on the history of America with companies that have really run, other than Berkshire hathway, none of them just kept going.

Your situation is the perfect low tax situation. Talk to a professional.; Figure out what your 2024 taxable income will be after all deductions, prior year losses, etc.  

Subtract that number from $47,025

Sell enough stock so that your capital gain from that sale will equal or be just a bit less than that number. Your sale of the stock will not be taxed at all- as long as the lots you sell are LTCG. 

For example: 47,025 - income of 40,000= 7,025
You can now realize $7,025 GAIN from stock with zero additional tax
I.e. stock that you purchased for 1,000 is sold for 8,025= 7,025 capital gain
Each year you can do this with zero additional taxes, but the 47k number increases every year. 
If you want to sell more, re-invest only 85%of the gains, since you will be taxed 15% of the GAINS (not the sale) of any gains+income between 47,025 up to 518,900. Keep the 15% in a high yield savings or another easy to access investment.; Don't fear paying long-term capital gains. It's likely 15% for you. 

The market can easily shift that much to the negative, and then you're stuck with a margin debt. 

My advice is to just realize the gains you need and stick a portion of it away to pay the taxes.

At your income level your portfolio is impressive. Kudos 👏; A margin loan is borrowing against the underlying security, so the way I understand them is you aren't selling. It is like taking a out a line of credit against your home. That rate is rough, so I wouldn't even think about it.

If you want to 'rebalance' then sell and pay the taxes. While it is never a great idea to have all your equity tied up in a couple stocks (since anything could happen to drop it 10-20% in a trading day) you have to analyze the company and investment.

Mates correct me if I misunderstood anything.; First. Do basic math. One years interest is only slightly below the total tax you would pay.


Also total tax only equivalent to about a 15% market correction.


You can also create capital gains, and use proceeds to fund a 401k, pretax. Income tax rates are quite a bit higher than capital gains, therefore you can sell, create liquidity, diversify, etc....; Sell gradually as you need the cash, to use multiple years allowances.

And also, the cost of a margin loan goes to making someone else money, the cost of paying tax goes to the country and helping other people and contributing to shared services and utilities.

Sure, paying tax can be galling but you can manage your tax exposure and still contribute to the country you live in.; Don’t forget state taxes on capital gains; Just pay your taxes. Don't complicate things. You're up all that money - money you didn't have. Just pay your damn taxes and enjoy the money.; That margin interest is super high - don’t do that!

Trouble is when they drop….; You should be able to negotiate. I think my rate is around 7% on fidelity. Still not great though.; You probably should rebalance the portfolio!; Are you expecting to die tomorrow and get step up in basis? /s

Like many others have said, just sell some of your holdings each year at 0-15% tax brackets.  If you want, every year just buy it back and rotate lot numbers to always be selling at 0-15% tax brackets.  

Really no excuse not to use up the 0% tax bracket.; What are you trying to do? Why would you ever do something dumb like a margin loan at 13% APY?; Sell only what you need or want to invest in something else. Eat the tax. Not worth the headache of avoiding.

Otherwise, open a Roth IRA and load it with 7,000 a year in tax free long term gains once you're 59 1/2.; Ok dumb question ? Say I put in 25 k my stock goes to 100 k  , when I’m taking out money the first 75 k is always the taxable? What if I take out my 25 k original ! I shouldn’t need to pay any tax this year cause it’s my original investment ! C or No ?; Why isn't this in an IRA or 401k?!; what's the reason for selling? Is it just to free up some cash? Taxes are pretty minor for long term gains and you can hold back the cash to pay them (if you even have any). 

If you want to just lock in some gains, as someone else suggested, selling covered calls until you get called away is the way to go. You'll get some extra profits no matter what you do.; it does not seem you have money in Roth IRA. Why don't you move securities into Roth IRA, then rebalance.; Margin, like options, is a mistake from the start. If I wanted day trading to feel like I got drunk and fucked with my money every day, I'd do margins or options because that's what it's like; Not sure if it’s possible, but can you somehow roll your portfolio into a Roth IRA?; Good shit dude on having that ratio between stocks and income. You should make more my brother.; Sell 25% of your shares each quarter if you want to. Eventually you will sell them and pay taxes on them.; You have 500k in collateral and Merrill is offering a 13% margin rate? That's asinine. I've never traded on margin and won't even think about now.; Retired Wall Streeter here who owns several household tech names all up 10X, 15X, etc. (nice problem to have, isn't it? LOL).

Long term capital gains taxes is only 15% for someone in your tax bracket, so it's really not much of a hit. If you're looking to sell part of your long positions for purposes of diversification to take some concentration risk off the table, then paying a little LT gain tax is a smart move. BTW, if you own anything currently that's at a loss, you could sell that position in the same tax year as your winners to get some offsetting tax benefit.

Not sure if you're making charitable contributions at this stage, but you can also gift shares of appreciated stock to individuals, churches and/or legit charities of your choice as well. Lots of folks do this in lieu of writing checks out of their checking accounts.

I wouldn't use margin loans unless it's a last resort...and for then, only a short period of time. Back in the day, I knew of a few wealth managers who suggested taking out margin loans of 6% annually on their clients' equity portfolios to generate a ""tax-free"" source of income. The problem with the strategy is that markets don't go up 10% every year without surprising selloffs. I wicked downturn can destroy capital like nobody's' business in a heavily margined portfolio.

For a small percentage of your total portfolio (up to 20% or so), the odds of you getting margined out are slim to none, but once you keep leveraging up beyond that you subject yourself to bigtime risk should a Black Swan event occur.

The fact that you already understand and see the Big Red Flag here has already answered your own question.; What do you want the money for? I don’t think you answered that.; If you go with a margin loan, you could do it for cheaper at interactive brokers; Your understanding of taxes is hurting you more than anything.; I work in the industry, and there are tax loss harvesting products that I have seen used effectively to help exit a position.; Don't be afraid of a little 15% tax either.  And it's only the money your investment has gained, the appreciation, that is being taxed anyway.  You're making money hand over fist.

Don't do margin loans if you don't have a really good reason to.  Everyone thinks they're so smart with options but then they lose their shirts.; How long have you been holding apple and google? What's your coat basis?; Sell options agains it. You will make money either way; I would sell in the new year and put the money into High Yield Savings and call it a day.; There was an old joke about the guy that robbed liquor stores to play the pony's so he could build a stake for big card games.; The trolls have really been losing their edge lately...; Why are you selling?; Sell and pay the taxes like most have said; It takes a lot more to do this right. The strategy is a little more complex than just a margin loan. You can spread the tax over years. Some now. More or the rest in January depending on how fast you want out. Take the win, pay the tax; If you need cash, do a box spread for a very low interest loan...using your positions as margin.  Check out this link

It’s leverage and can cut both ways. But the rates they are quoting you seem absurd. It should be half that. 
Then, sell whatever you can/want and stay at a low tax rate.; It should be a red flag. Don't do it. Why are you thinking about selling? Do you need the money? If not, don't sell. If you do, only sell what you need and pay the 15% tax.; I'd say no to the margin loans. Your account size does not justify it. The ends do not justify the means. I also recommend getting a good CPA. 

Which also opens the door to which tax rate you fall into? You might qualify for a 0% or 15% rate in which case, just pay it. 

If you have a high income:

Be sure to ask your CPA about what your long-term goals are because that'll make it easier to review your options. 

Everything from using a charitable trust or a corporate structure that allows you to use businesses ""expenses"" to offset your taxable ""income"" [if you catch my drift], or utilizing a many other methods to offset the tax implications. 

At the end of the day it all depends on your end goal. 

Personal opinion:

Low income and paying long-term cap tax - just sell it. 

Moderate income - consider getting a CPA, just sell it. 

High income - get a CPA and set up a structure that allows you to EtHiCaLlY use your ""losses"" to offset your ""gains"". The purpose of the structure is to give you more tax flexibility. 

I'm no pro and I may be wrong on many points. I usually just let my CPA & corp. attorney handle everything. Leave the professional work to the professionals and all that.

Edit: not to make things political but a lot of HNW individuals you see (Rump, Musk, etc.) use a system that is exclusive to individuals who have a level of assets of a certain type and wealth that you (probably) do not. Some of the practices they used to increase their margins and/or escape taxes should put them beneath the jail.

Stay the fuck away from those loans. If you need to rebalance, do rebalance and pay the taxes as necessary.

Yes? Just sell only as much as you need and prefer to sell your bad investments to reduce the tax burden. Don't take a margin loan 

A loan should only be used as a tool to fulfill some end goal which results in a greater upside than the cost of the loan and you can afford to lose what you are risking. Otherwise it is a surefire way to burn your hands and take away from the prosperity of future you.; Find an accountant and ask them.

The question at the end of the day isn't whether or not you should be paying taxes, you will have to pay that eventually to tap into your profits.. the real question is whether or not you have an opportunity to grow that money elsewhere. The opportunity cost of not selling can be significant.

If there is a better place to move the asset, then realize it and pay the taxes.; I have a much lower rate on my SLOC, securities backed line of credit.  You should apply for something like that.  It’s one of the best interest rates you can get, better than something like a heloc because the underlying asset is so easy to repossess.

E*trade approved me in minutes, easiest access to cash I ever had.; You could start selling calls on those stocks an year out at 30 delta or approximately 15% above current market price. This will supplement your income because you can withdraw premium right away; Margin loans would be foolish for someone in your position. Just start selling small amounts each year and pay the taxes (if any). You're in a low tax bracket, so you should be doing this whether you need the money or not. Just sell and then reinvest the money if you don't need it for living expenses. Check with a tax or financial advisor to come up with a long-term plan.; Too many questions unanswered.

1.  Capital gains tax is tiered based on income.  Talk to a CPA to find out how much you can sell without triggering the next tier.

2.  Merrill Edge’s borrowing rate at 13% is horrible.  Try moving your assets to Wealthfront (5.5% borrowing rates) or Interactive Brokers (same), or maybe even Schwab or E-Trade for better costs.  

3. Margin or non-purpose loans are great for short term borrowing when you make more money than you do.  If your capital gains rate is less than 10%, sell your stock.  Conversely, these loans make sense for people who make a lot.  For example, the top capital gains rate in California is ~38% for people that make roughly more than $600k.  If these people can borrow against their assets/stock for 5%, then they have 7.5 years to repay the loan using their income streams that are already taxed (ie w2 wages or self employment).  In 7.5 years, stocks have the potential to double, so wealth could double and they paid no taxes beyond what they were going to anyways.  

4.  I don’t believe we know what your goals are.  What are your plans for the money?  Are you simply looking to diversify or are you looking to buy a house/make a similarly large purchase?  That could change the strategy as well. 

In your situation, these paths mostly lead to selling if your income is that low, but check with a cpa or ask the ai robot at turbotax to confirm. 

Good luck!; Pay your taxes

You can minimize your tax burden which an advisor/accountant can help with, but you will pay taxes nonetheless.; 15% cap gains tax is reasonable, just sell and reinvest. Don't overthink this. Your first logic is correct, taking a loan at that rate is guaranteed negative return.; Go learn about 0% tax gain harvesting ASAP.; 1000% and youre not taking gains... i don't get people's thought process....

But if you don't want to sell. Maybe start selling covered options so you can generate some income without selling the stock; you should wait till jan 1 to sell so that your capital gains are pushed off another year; The real question is how tf do you have anything in the market, much less huge gains on huge positions when you don't make jack.; 13% margin apr is crazy work; Move to Switzerland 0% tax; Sell half this year, half next year while the market is still close to a top and spread the cap gains over two years. Pay whatever the cap gains tax is, it's high absolute but not high in relative terms. 
The market won't rally like '23-24 anymore and there's a reasonable chance of a correction, the magnitude of such a drawdown is roughly what you would pay in taxes. No one ever lost money taking chips off the table while in profit, but waiting in an overvalued market, that could backfire.; Check the capital gains tax details. Some people here reported that you only pay tax if you earn above a certain amount. It sounds like you may be below that.

NOW, selling a stock will trigger a GAIN in income, so do the math accordingly to see how much you can safely sell without much of a tax liability. Maybe consider doing this annually until you feel comfortable with your rebalance.

I ran into this in 2020 when I was furloughed but I realized that in the sale I could just put aside a little bit of cash to cover the tax.

IBKR also allows ""portfolio margin"" for higher allowable leverage levels. To be clear I'm not suggesting to be a degen, but to have more cushion for swings.

Also, I wouldn't even consider borrowing against stocks unless you simultaneously have more stable assets somewhere else that can be used to cushion your account during volatility.; Margin loan only if it's a bridge situation.

Here's a quick description of how it can work. 

>A section 351 ETF conversion refers to a tax-related mechanism under U.S. tax law, specifically Section 351 of the Internal Revenue Code. This mechanism allows for the transfer of assets (such as stocks, securities, or other property) to a corporation without recognizing a taxable gain or loss, provided certain conditions are met.

>In the context of an ETF, a 351 exchange would typically involve the transfer of assets to the ETF in exchange for shares in that ETF without triggering a taxable event.

>In other words, you can contribute an investment portfolio and “seed” the launch of an ETF, and receive a diversified ETF in exchange

How much you are actually taxed depends on your income, how long you held the stock, etc.; This makes no sense. It’s all percentages.

This person makes $40,000 a year.

They should be realizing that amount. This is called tax gain harvesting. 

Second, the standard deduction increases annually along with the tax brackets. On this website, people often complain that their wages do not keep up with inflation.

According to the hive mind, this person will be making less and less each year and therefore be able to take advantage of a slightly larger amount of tax-free, long-term capital gain realization.

# Idea

Stochastic is a momentum indicator, very similar to another indicators (like RSI).  
As the study shows, it is very good for entry. But to use it for exit, you need to trade Trend Following.  
We will look at how it can be used for Mean Reversion.

The indicator produces two lines and takes two periods. Unfortunately we will not use both, as the second one is just an average for the first one. ('D' line is not used in strategy).

* **Initial Capital:** 10k$
* **Lots (In money)**: 500$
* **Data Period**: 2012.01.19 - 2024.11.28

*The strategy buys only if there are no open trades. That is, there can be only 1 trade at a time.*  
*The strategy does not have a shortsell trades as instrument is often in the uptrend.*

***Inputs:***

1. K\_Period: **1**/2/3
2. LowTh: 10/15/20/**25**/35/45/50

*D\_Period=1*  
*Slowing=0*

**Buy Rules:** Stoch(K\_Period, D\_Period, Slowing).Fast < LowTh  
*Fast is 'K' Line*  
**Filter**: Close > SMA(200) (Optionally)  
**Close Rule**: Close > High\[1\]

Since it is a [Mean Reversion](https://www.babypips.com/forexpedia/mean-reversion) strategy:  
**I do not recommend using the Stop Loss** as it increases the drawdown and reduces the profit.  
**I don’t recommend using Take Profit** as it reduces profits.

# Conclusions

1. Stochastic is perfect for entry, but bad for exit.
2. Works well on all MR instruments
3. 76% winrate, which is pretty normal for Mean Reversion.
4. The strategy has almost no optimization, but it works with the same parameters on all MR instruments.
5. You are free to choose when to exit the position.
6. Simple risk management is already doing more than the return of US100 with much lower drawdowns (7+ return / dd ratio)
7. Sharpe Ratio > 1, which is very rare for MR strategies.

You and I both know there is more to the story here 😉 

With that said, you should show the fuller picture. Include the robustness tests results that SQX generates.

How does this hold up with monte Carlo simulations? What about parameter sensitivity? How's the WFA look? All reds with spots of green? Or all green?

Try to be fully transparent. A lot of people here don't know any better and will actually go and try to trade this.; Use a a less leveraged instrument. Problem solved.; Thinking of getting Metatrader just to try some of these on some accounts of my own.; interesting, thank you for posting.; Your task as a trader, is to improve & simplify your approach for efficiency while maintaining an up trending equity curve while avoiding the draw down that leads to RoR. Risk of Ruin No one elses result matter as you’re not them, not likely trading the same system, the exact same way. Even if 100 people get the exact same trade it will yield 100 different results, this has been proven in simulation and in real time trading environments.

But I agree that using it for exit is bad; Your parameters (Stoch 1,1,1) < 25 seem to equate to IBS < 25

I eyeballed my tradingview chart and I am not seeing profitable months in July and August  2024; How about some examples of those number of trades (with pics including indicators). Thanks; So basically it's more about the crossing of the fast Vs slow stochastic. When you say no take profit you mean you choose in stochastic crossing on the other side?; Seems dope; If 826% yearly was possible you'd put every hedge fund out of business - what do you know that they don't? Why aren't we all sitting at home algo trading?; Which library did you use to create those charts?; Nice. But I am not statistically trained and am confused, if you say US100 is in an uptrend, which it is, then it tends to behave more like stocks, and it is different from FX and commodities, because mean reversion works for these instruments. So why would mean reversion work in this case?; This is good stuff, very good stuff.  

I'd love to hop on a call with you sometime to pick your brain because I'm trying to develop a similar algorithm for evaluating traders' performance over time. Each successful trader's confidence interval will be determined by recent performance, thus introducing a human element to the equation.  All the successful trader's trades will be made, but with a weighting according to their confidence score.  Thus resulting in better performance overall.; Thank you for posting!

Adding my experience playing with this idea:

Implemented in Tradingview's strategy tester, on a daily timeframe, where it has a positive win rate and profit factor  (even better on the weekly!)

US100 w. Deep Backtesting on D := 70% profitable , 1.034 profit factor 

TSLA D := 67%, 1.578 PF

GOOG D := 69%, 1.68

I do think it has potential and I will start with a small account and see where it goes :); What kind of education do you recommend to start working on this kind of business?; Such strategies often fail on Monte Carlo because it have high winrate and big losses (unlike Trend Following where small winrate, small losses, big profits). 

Monte Carlo is more suitable when you have equal profits and losses for each trade (takeprofit + stoploss).

I usually bring a list of parameters and values, you can see it in the previous posts. So all strategies pass the sensitivity test for parameters successfully. Especially where one indicator is used.

Walk Forward is doing a great job.

In general, I initially test a strategy on 1-3 years of data. Then I test it on all the other years. Besides, the “Return /DD Ratio” parameter is important to me. As you can see, this strategy also works on other markets with the same inputs.

As practice shows such strategies rarely pass all tests. It will all fail, as this is the nature of mean reversion and trading without stop loss.

This only means that the strategy can be worse than others.  
But it does not mean that the strategy does not work.; Great idea; Great words; Glad it helped; Yes, using stochastics to exit leads to longer trades; may be good for planned exits too. ( and further, with contingencies and insurance/hedge etc); Trading View is a bit different and does not allow you to set the parameters you need. In Metatrader and Quant X it is possible.

Try experimenting with Stochastic, change its parameters and Threshold for you. Try also Sotch RSI.   
  
Not compared to IBS, but many strategies correlate. That's why I try to make different position closing rules; Next time I will try to add indicators to the picture via Trading View. Thanks for advice; No. It's not about crossing stochastic lines. Its' about using main line.   
No take profit = no limit order.  
**Close Rule**: Close > High\[1\]  
*Yesterday's close was higher than the day before that*; If you know how to use information and check it for truthfulness, that's always cool!; If you're talking about prop firms, they have drawdown limits for customers.

To make 826% yearly you have to put up with -80% drawdown (that's what you missed when you were admiring the beautiful equity chart).

Even to do 20% yearly you have to put up with -15% drawdown, which is shown in the Overview picture.

You can safely trade on FTMO with -5% drawdown, but then the profit will be less. I don't want to lose my account because my drawdown is lower than I am allowed.

I have all funds distributed between 10+ accounts, I do not use stop losses, but I am insured that my account will explode or be deleted.; It's not library. It's programm called ""Strategy Quant X""; That's the nature of the instrument. Statistically top stocks and indices are mean revertable. Forex too, but there you need to use the Shortsell trades. I have attached to my previous posts a video where a person demosntrates working on forex; Good thoughts.; Thank you for sharing your results!; I think YouTube videos is enough. Algo trading ideas, strategies. Tutorials for you language and software; Thanks for the follow up.

I was just giving examples of robustness tests -- indeed, not all tests are applicable to all strategies.

The broader point I was making was about effectively empowering the audience.

You took several screenshots, but seemed to leave out the ones that actually mattered most -- the robustness tests; one of the very things that makes SQX such a great research tool.

IMHO, whenever possible, one should try to share the whole picture.; Will contact you if you are open to a tutorial or questions.; Thank you & Happy Holidays to you & yours!; Would you recommend trading this with some leverage? 

My risk tolerance allows for a 50% drawdown on my account in unrealized losses.

Let’s say I want to start out with a 1k account would it be reasonable to trade 1 or 0,5 lots per trade or something else?

If this would be profitable, what ‘formula’ should I use in order to determine how much lots i should use?

59,Is there a point in investing in emerging markets?,"Many people invest in emerging markets with the rationale that these countries have a huge growth potential. But my rationale says that even if these economies grow, it's the companies from the developed world that will benefit the most. For example, as poor countries gain more disposable incomes, they'll be able to buy more expensive products like iPhones and MacBooks. So this will help the Apple stock grow not the stock of some company in these emerging economies. That's not to say those companies won't grow at all, sure they will with increased internal demand, but the developed world has more to gain from the growth of the emerging economies. Also, most internal growth will come from international companies opening their manufacturing plants in emerging economies like Apple and Samsung manufacturing in India. So again it only makes sense to invest in developed world.

Contrary to popular belief, U.S. equities do not outperform International long-term. While U.S. stocks have been outperforming for the past ~15 years, historically international and U.S. stocks have exchanged in periods of outperformance lasting 10-15 years. 

Nobody knows the future… that’s why we should diversify.; USA was once an emerging market in a world of European superpowers. 

Diversify.; If a small country grows, which company’s profit will likely increase more? Apple (0.05% of revenues coming from that country) vs a local construction company (100% revenues from that country).; Everything you just said is known information priced into the market. If you want to concentrate in US large cap growth/tech, [at today’s valuations](https://x.com/benjaminwfelix/status/1865123503659188719?s=46), you can eventually learn the lesson of how outsized revenue growth does not equate to outsized stock returns yourself.; Nope. Capitalism is global now. And in capitalism, it's a winners-take-all endgame.

US companies already have their tentacles in every corner of the world, essentially becoming multi-national corporations that eat up local/emerging competition. AKA virtually unchecked monopolies.

There's virtually no way for developing countries to gain enough momentum to take down the big guys, due to lack of vertical integration, inability to get the best pricing on raw resources (due to lack of volume), lack of brand recognition/loyal userbase, and being unable to compete with the existing mass infrastructures that global companies have already built for themselves.; They theoretically pay a risk premium. They also have low correlation to the S&P 500 so they're excellent for diversification. The growth potential is actually irrelevant.; I don’t believe the opportunities are as great as they once were. All of the largest companies in all of the most developed countries are making enormous amounts of cash, and they are looking for investment opportunities. Some companies famously sit on piles of cash, such as Apple, but other companies are taking that cash and investing just like a private investor would do. They’re buying up smaller companies or interests in similar sectors or part of their supply chain in these developed countries, and the financial sector of course you would see loans being given out to those companies in emerging markets, which is a form of investment and therefore investing in the bank itself, could be an opportunity to return from the success of emerging markets tangentially. 

I think it would be very difficult for a retail investor to make a smart choice of which individual company to invest in within any particularemerging market, and even investing in a broadly diversified ETF of the emerging market is a shotgun approach. 

It’s the classic wisdom of when there’s a gold rush you want to be in the business of selling shovels. All of those emerging markets are looking for capital and investment, and the biggest corporations in the world are able to service that need. So you’re chasing an extra few percent for an enormous amount of extra risk. If you’re ok with that - go for it.; Emerging markets are risky and complicated, and involve investing in other currencies and political environments - environments that are not necessarily as business-friendly as the United States. It can take 2 years to register a trademark in Brazil. 

But I think you’re missing a major concept - which is the law of diminishing returns. The more companies grow, the harder it is for them to grow more. Sometimes they run out of “easy” customers and have to work harder to convince more skeptical / stingy potential customers. Or maybe their growth rate is slowed by increasing competition in their space - like Netflix during the streaming wars. Or maybe they become so massive that they can’t adapt quickly enough to capture new opportunities. In 1980, IBM was the biggest company on the planet. But it didn’t adapt, and was overtaken by Apple and Microsoft. Big ships turn slowly. 

Early growth is easy, later growth is hard. And that’s one of the reasons emerging markets can be attractive. Assuming you have a long time horizon and appetite for risk. 

I recommend reading this: 

https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/special-reports/look-forward/emerging-markets-a-decisive-decade; Not really necessary to invest in emerging markets for diversity, since many US companies do business in foreign markets.  (Plus, in recent years US stocks have outperformed foreign. ) But there are some interesting money making opportunities to be had in emerging markets.  I invested in Mercado Libre MELI many years ago with great benefit.  Now I am in NU (south america) SE (southeast Asia) GRAB (southeast asia) that are all involved in developing countries.; Emerging Markets tend to have unstable natural resource based economies, with higher level of corruption. That seems to go with the asset class.

IMO its necessary to be selective and identify the country that is moving into the category of developed market.  

I wouldn't want to buy a broad basket of Emerging Markets just because they are Emerging Markets. Its myth that all emerging markets will become developed markets. Many are always going to be under performing, because of culture, government, education, corruption, civil war, etc.; So there’s this guy, Paul Merriman.  Look up his research on small cap value and growth.; I have my international all in FSPSX (developed countries only). I don't trust emerging markets. That's just based on gut and I could be completely wrong. But either way I don't think it will matter too much if I had put it my international allocation in FTIHX/VXUS vs. FSPSX. Last few years they have performed similarly.; Yes absolutely there is for diversification. A total international index like VTIAX / VXUS is roughly 80% developed non US and 20% Emerging Markets. I am not inclined to have more emerging market exposure than that in my portfolio. If I was I would look at buying IEMG from ishares…; >But my rationale says that even if these economies grow, it's the companies from the developed world that will benefit the most

They will still have some industries that are better served by local companies. There are things like the utilities sector, possibly natural resources, etc.

>but the developed world has more to gain from the growth of the emerging economies

Both established companies from developed countries and upcoming companies from the emerging countries themselves can benefit.

Remember that Taiwan is considered an emerging market and the 9th largest company (by free float market cap) is in Taiwan (https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vtwax#portfolio-composition note that I'm counting Alphabet A & C as the same).

Then you get things like the utilities sector, possibly natural resources, etc.

And it also isn't exactly what companies will grow more, but rather grow compared to what the market was already expecting of them.

Edit: Typos; I've often thought the same thing, and your conclusion will even get stronger over the years (that US-dominated multinational companies will be benefactors of ""international growth"").

ETF's are OK but they're almost always in some kleptocratic bureaucratic companies that were de-nationalized like petrochemicals or banks. For instance, look at the top holdings of EWZ. It's all petro/old bank garbage with the exception of NU. You could have bought just NU by simply following what Buffett does.

The ""but you must invest in international markets to diversify"" mantra doesn't hold us much water now as it did 20 years ago (when intl outperformed US for a hot minute). The large US players are truly huge and their reach, and thus profits, are much larger now than ever.; ""even if these economies grow, it's the companies from the developed world that will benefit the most."" - that's the part that's not true.  We can debate whether emerging markets are worth the risk and whether growth in GDP really equates directly to growth in stock prices but its a given fact that local companies benefit direct and far more than companies from developed worlds.   Those are the companies the locals grew up on, has fond childhood memories about and it's impossible to remove.  100% of their business is tied to that local economy vs sometimes less than 10% for these international expansions.; >For example, as poor countries gain more disposable incomes, they'll be able to buy more expensive products like iPhones and MacBooks.

How exactly did they gain disposable income?  The local economy with local companies improving, expanding?; I got AVUV it's as far as I go; Only if they have a democracy; Yes, EEM (the oldest emerging markets ETF) has delivered a solid  8.38% return since inception in 2003 and is fairly uncorrelated with developed markets.

That's a 9% return if you account for the overpriced 0.70% expense ratio that the fund has (you would use VWO or IEMG today which are both under 10 basis points).; You want to buy LOW and sell HIGH. 

People say “oh, suuuuure. Easy to say, improbable to actually do…”

Look at NVDA vs BABA. Anyone who wants, remind yourself with the bot to look at the performance from here over three years. Or do it with VTI vs VWO. 

Everyone who wants to outperform VOO needs exposure to emerging markets going forward.; I think American companies are too global now to bother.

I’m sure there will be exceptions but it’s not like I’m hurting for American options.  Why bet on the long shot when the favorites are available to buy?; I like FSPSX; One should argue it’s actually the mix of risk and diversification not the diversification alone. It’s also a bet on higher growth as their economies develop and materialize higher performing businesses with a more technologically sophisticated workforce over time ; It does not seem to work anymore. Right now everything goes to US stocks. Just look how badly Mexico and Brazil were beaten up. China is fighting with the 62% retracement of the recent upmove. 
Yes there will be a time where emerging markets will come back but for now it does not look like it.; VXUS 10-year  return: +19%.  Inflation ate it up and more.  A lot of money not gained with this perennial loser.; In my opinion no. There are great opportunities in the US markets without having to risk currency crises or unstable governance overseas. For international exposure you could consider US manufacturers who may soon be expanding overseas such as Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation.

The incoming administration has stated support for their nascent ‘flying car’ industry and NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration is working closely with them both. Morgan Stanley has forecast the Advanced Air Mobility market could be worth $1 trillion by 2040.

In my opinion both companies offer great potential over the next ten to fifteen years but also as potential short term gains if the share prices ride up as worldwide commercial launches hopefully take place in 2025/26. That said they are more risky investments than your average company or an Index tracker for example.

I have recently setup a sub for discussing Joby r/JOBY_Investors and also recently joined another new sub for r/ACHR_Investors.

Good luck whatever you choose to do!; [deleted]; Every time I see a post asking why invest in non US equities, I buy 100 VXUS.; >While U.S. stocks have been outperforming for the past ~15 years, historically international and U.S. stocks have exchanged in periods of outperformance lasting 10-15 years.

Except there’s always one component of this that’s always ignored: Magnitude. Your goal as an investor isn’t the product of binary win/loss periods. 

The “golden” example in favor of exUS is always the “Lost Decade”. Everyone loves to use it when describing exUS’s benefit. Well here’s how well that went:

* US: -0.62% CAGR

* exUS: +1.74% CAGR

Well that’s technically a win, and as a bonus I won’t even mention the volatility.

How about the next 10?

* US: +13.17%

* exUS: +4.66%

Seems a ten year period of insignificant outperformance didn’t really compete with the divide over the next 10. Either way, all this theory is basically trashed with rolling returns of any period size of your choosing. 

exUS is a value trap. Has been that way for nearly 40 years. The top exUS industries are closer to the US in 2000 than today. If you want banks, snack foods, pharma, and gas…you can get exposure to those things without the currency risk.; The world is more globalized since 2000, and we have entered and remain in an rich/big/strong environment where existing global companies can push out any newcomers. The EU is starting to put some pressure on monopolies, but otherwise few governments seem to care.

With that said, I keep ~10% of my portfolio in VXUS for diversification.; Great answer. I agree with this; True; Bingo. And back then European investors probably thought ""why invest in those colonial upstarts when the East India Company is right here?"" History has some hard lessons about underestimating emerging powers.; The US began as a colony of the most powerful economy in the world, with no significant competition at all to pursue resource extraction from basically an entire continent. 

There are no other modern emerging markets where this is also true. 

The closest rehash will be space colonization if that ever happens. ; I agree, even if in absolute terms their logic was accurate, even a modest increase in business can be a large percentage increase for businesses in developing countries.  So I don't agree with their analysis from that perspective.

But the question you should really be asking yourself is if you, the foreign investor, are going to be the one to see the full benefit of that growth.  One of the reasons that emerging markets are not already as developed is that they often have less stable governments, less mature institutions, more corruption, etc.  They may not be committed to providing a level playing field for foreign shareholders to extract value from their economy.  You might find yourself in situations where the developing countries economy has strong growth, the companies you invest in have solid growth and profits, and yet for one reason or another your investment returns are not always what you'd expect.  There may be obstacles and challenges to realizing your gains that you wouldn't expect from a developed nation with a more robust stock market.

I think it's worth investing some moderate amount (no more than 20% or so) for the sake of diversification, but would be wary of having too much exposure, especially exposure to any one particular developing country.  If you're investing in ETFs, you want to look at what the allocation is to different countries.  You might find that an ""emerging market"" ETF is actually 80% China, for example, so it's not nearly as much global diversification as you would have thought.; You're not going to invest in that local construction company with an emerging markets ETF or mutual fund. You're just not. You'll be stuck with some petro-state garbage, banks, and maybe local retail or a cell phone carrier. 

Finding the diamond in the remote rough is the work of actively managed funds, which are particularly hated here in r/investing .; Specific examples of fast growing companies in emerging markets: NU, MELI. They are unlikely to be disrupted by multinational companies and benefit from growing economies in Latin America.; This rationale has nothing do with the present valuations. I know the market is overvalued. Buffet is sitting on the biggest cash pile of all time. It's common knowledge.; This.  Large US companies are already global and if there's a large profit to be made they'll jump on it.  You're not going to see the next Amazon spring up in Mali...sorry that's how our world works now. 

I don't think international, specifically emerging markets, will outperform US but that's my take.; I think at the moment what we're seeing is ""the winner taking it all"" - and one wonders what will happen if more and more of the world's money is shifted into US equities.


Arguably - diversifying is preparation for when the bubble bursts: because that money will have to go somewhere.; I didn't realize GRAB was listed on the NASDAQ. I might look into it, especially since Uber pulled out of that region entirely (and sold the business to them).; I dont trust them either, they have too much corruption and political instability; What if I wanted to invest specifically in African companies?; US companies operate more and more internationally, so one could think, the are somewhat diversified already. It's like global companies chose to place their headquarters in the U.S. for specific advantages like regulation and investment opportunity.; By MNCs from US opening their offices in India for example. I am a Software Engineer and the top payers are companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon. And now Apple, Samsung have started to manufacture there as well.; Lol that's even worse. As soon as these companies grow and become mid cap they are out of the portfolio. How will you ride the growth wave like that?; EEM: 1-year return:  +8%    
10-year : +7%    
From inception (2003):  +291%     
QQQ from 2003:  +1,620%; Yes, but what about emerging market ETFs?; Your returns must be terrible lol; It's asked so often, you must have bought millions of shares by now.; Up 2.28% in the last year.  My savings account has a better return lol.; Your argument is that the last 20-30 years of US and exUS returns should be expected to repeat just because they are what happened before? Despite the fact that US returns in this period are an historical outlier and [US valuations have been pushed to near record levels](https://x.com/benjaminwfelix/status/1865123503659188719?s=46)? Thinking that you know more than the market and that recent past returns can be projected forward are two of the most classic blunders in investing. Your goal should be reliable good returns, not highest possible returns with unnecessary risks, and country diversification is always a more reliable strategy in an unknown future.; Europeans were very keen to invest in the colonies at the time. It was how they made money. ; Yep. I would 100% rather have an investment in a $1M company that grows to $5M, than in a $1B company that grows to 1.008B even though that’s twice as much growth, the first company grew by $4M and the 2nd grew by $8M.

Big companies grow in value when they increase profitability of products. Small companies also have massive opportunity to grow by growing their market share. If you have 50% of the market, it takes a lot of effort to grow to 55%, and have 10% growth in sales. If you have 0.5% of the market, it takes one viral YouTube video to grow to 1% and have 100% growth in sales.

It’s betting on the long shot at the racetrack. Growth potential means that l it has a chance of paying off really really big, and much less of a chance to lose your shirt than, for example, betting on options.; Ahh… a case for AVDV and AVES! Hehehe. 10% each and call it a day for international diversification?; Your rationale as I understand it is that developed market companies will benefit most from the growth of emerging market economies. That doesn’t seem like something the market isn’t already acutely aware of or particularly different from the last four centuries of public stock investing. I think you could get yourself into a lot of trouble with narrative bias and authority bias trying to weight your portfolio based on how you personally think returns will play out or how Berkshire Hathaway is positioned. Obvious information confers no advantage; South Korea and Taiwan prove you wrong though. They were 3rd world countries in 1960. They spawned TSMC, Samsung, LG, Kia and Hyundai; I think you could see countries blocking the largest US corporations. No Facebook or Google. No Amazon. Those companies, especially Meta, are trying to be the layer on the Internet that everything is built on, but that only works as long as they're allowed to. I could see after increasing election interference regions like the EU simply blocking them and letting homegrown, regulated ones take their place.


No reason Mali can't do the same. They may be regionally limited but after 2016 the people have voted for more protectionism, more national options. So I think we'll have it. ; That's my thinking.

I can't see the emerging market developing a next Microsoft, Google , apple , etc. And if they try these companies will buy them out .; https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1hjs94u/based_on_rural_reach_indias_tiktok_substitutes/


Related to my other comment. I don't think a company will come out of India to take the US market, but there will be growth opportunities in countries like this with growing middle classes. 


Then again TikTok came out of China and nobody expected that. ; AFK or EZA; AVUV is basically the ETF version of DFSVX which has returned 11.55% since inception in 1993.

Source: https://www.dimensional.com/us-en/funds/dfsvx/us-small-cap-value-portfolio-i; It's my Hedge against VOO which is 50% of my portfolio.; Emerging markets ETF's are usually trash. For every gem you'll get three Evergreens or some mismanaged oil company/bank.

Edit: prove me wrong with recent data, not 30-50 years ago.; [deleted]; He mostly keeps his eyes shut.; exUS has worse absolute and *risk-adjauted* returns, revenues are global and only homogenizing further, and historical performance is simultaneously the reason I should expect an exUS resurgence, but not expect US outperformance…

Comparing the two’s valuations is pointless because (again) exUS is a value trap in aggregate. Plus you’re taking on various country risks that don’t exist in the US…including currency, lack of stockholder protections, and no legal right to ownership. 

International investing is sold as a no brainer, set and forget product…and sold it has been. Jack Bogle was totally against it, but Fidelity and Vanguard made it cheap and they’ve been pushing it ever since. 

Again, you’re free to rummage the holdings and assess if there’s anything there you simply can’t capture domestically do without. You’re free to paint a bull picture based on the valuation, but you need to also ask yourself why it’s sat that low for so long if it’s the next no-brainer.  Frankly, I can’t really find more than a few things I wouldn’t qualify as trash.

I dont really want Novo, Shell, Nestle, and Astrazenca in my top holdings. I dont hate ASML or TSMC. I want nothing out of China or South Korea. Easy choice to just not partake.; I'm talking about this point forward in time.  Our largest companies are simply too big and powerful.  If you had some start up start killing it in Uruguay, it wouldn't be long before a large company would either come in and take over or buy them out.  The whole set up of the 1960s was completely different.

The modern world was still developing  in the 1900's but it's hard to see this status quo changing much.  The big players are set and the discrepancy between the leading economics and emerging economies is massive in resources, technology,  education, etc.

 There were no companies close to the size of our biggest players back in the 1960s and the dominant sectors today didn't even exist.; South Korea shareholder protections are terrible. Companies can do amazing and the stock will do nothing. This is by design.; You get TSMC in the SP500. The rest you mentioned vacillate from bread winners to dysfunctional basket cases every few years.; Oh my gosh… Samsung?? Hyundai??

Yeah, I’ll take the American companies. You can have the exceptions, I’ll take the rule.; You’re missing the point. If you have $100k to invest, and emerging markets do take off, it IS likely that established companies will take most of that growth, yes. And GOOGL will make an extra $100M and go up 0.1%, but the local companies making an extra $10M might go up 500% because of that.; I'd never bet on India; No one asked about BTC here. That's not part of emerging markets. Think ETFs with stocks in places like Brazil, India, China, etc. (E.g. Vanguard's VWO).; People act like there is no country risk in the US...

I mean, you may be fine for 10 years or maybe the rest of your life. But maybe not. Look back 100 years instead of 20. The UK was sitting pretty sweet. Go back further when the Dutch ruled the world economy.

Recency bias, home bias, endowment effect, Dunning-Krueger, herding, a whole host of cognitive biases are working to blind us.

Bogle incidentally happened to be alive during the American century, when even bonds were great. He said it wasn't necessary, not that he was against it (did advise no more than 20 percent international.) Then again he also failed to follow his own advice several times such as trying to time the market. If you lived Bogle's timeline of course he was prescient but we are living our timeline.; Surely people used the same logic for the East Indies companies back in the day?; To add to your point. Look at the newest big growth area, AI. Who is running it? All the big existing companies.

The only risk I see is if when/if governments get serious about antitrust. The EU has done a little, and the little the US was doing is about to stop. So, party on.; Good point . Didn't think of that .; This is an excellent point. I also like how you just integrated Einstein’s theory of relativity into a global equities debate. Nicely done!; I'd consider a bet on India for India, not India for world economic domination. They are growing their middle class rapidly. ; Why not? They have about 17% of the world’s population with a growing number of highly educated workers.; First, I never even mentioned ‘country’ risk*. I specifically mentioned other categorical risks that are directly verifiable today…and have been for some time. You can throw out every bias you want, but your examples just highlight the nonsense of the “pro” argument and Bogle was making these claims in the 2010s. Not exactly a reflection without modern considerations. 

*Edit: I did write country risk, but meant “country specific” risks. Not broad “country risk” that pertains mostly to EM. Lack of right to ownership and non-existent shareholder protections are literally the biggest concerns I have with the countries I would otherwise like the most*

Why is a stance that these objective issues are a problem any more biased than someone’s position that they’re actually not…when 30+ years of returns have yet to support it? It amazing how many people can see the outcome of a generational divide and continue to profess it will end, without the ability to pinpoint a catalyst beyond P/E, which is a terrible metric to throw your weight behind. 

> If you lived Bogle's timeline of course he was prescient but we are living our timeline

There’s absolutely zero need to examine the world through the lens of colonialism (which you basically did) but that’s sadly not a rare argument. If things get better outside the US, it’s not like these changes ripple through the market overnight. If the problems I see disappear, I can change strategy with plenty of time. 

As it sits today, economic outlooks and quality of companies are miles apart (I can’t stress enough to look at the industries you’re counting on). Maybe in another 30 years that will change, but I plan to be long retired by then.; We're comparing apples to oranges.  Saying because it worked like this in the past so that's how it'll work in the future is very similar to the caution ""past performance is not indicative of future results"" on every prospectus.

We live in a world with a massive discrepancy between 1st world and 3rd world.  1st world countries are now developing AI and Quantum Computing.  I think it's a bit of a gamble to think that a major development in those sectors is going to come from a country that doesn't have reliable electricity, internet, or a functional government. 

It's not totally impossible but highly unlikely.  I'd put my money on the most advanced economies.  US, maybe some Asian exposure. 

If others disagree and want to invest in emerging, by all means and I really do wish you (and those countries) the best! It would have positive effects for everyone...more trade, more entrepreneurs and developers etc etc; Keep in mind that many of the new companies putting AI to use in real world applications are Chinese (but just getting started). I believe the Chinese are also graduating far more skilled workers and engineers from universities on an annual basis than we are in the US. Their workforce is highly skilled in CS and CE. They also often  work 6 days per week, with longer hours, on average. This is why I’ve been using VEA+VWO at a 1:1 ratio instead of VXUS. I’m betting that some of the Chinese startups are going to make waves. But, a great point was made about US companies potentially gobbling them up. I had not really considered that angle. I recognize that my theory or bet is just that. This is why I don’t recommend my own allocation to newcomers.; Next to the US (chipsets + software), China (an “emerging” country in many ETFs) actually has a highly skilled workforce that will likely revolutionize the **application of** AI in consumer products. And if only they were able to get those NVDA chipsets… they could become the tech super power. 

For this reason I’ve considered a crazy investment in CQQQ, but the risks of their governments interference with markets were just too high for me. 

I carry 10% VEA + 10% VWO for Ex-US diversification. Unfortunately, I still don’t expect them to perform well. 

Very recently, and mostly thanks to Reddit (for better or worse), I’ve thought about swapping out VEA and VWO with AVDV and AVES. But, it’s just an idea. 

Frankly, I’m getting frustrated with myself for constantly tinkering with the Ex-US portion of my portfolio for many years, all the while watching terrible results. Part of me thinks to go 20% VXUS and chill (and accept what may yet again prove to be a continuous drag on total portfolio return), OR just abandon the Ex-US investment altogether like recommended by Buffet for almost all investors and just be ready to ride out the next (eventual) cycle where Ex-US outperforms. So many choices."

61,P/E Ratios in the Tech Sector,"Alright guys and girls... I'm looking for some of the big investors on here with high 6 or even 7 figure plus portfolios. I'm wondering what folks with a lot more time in the market are thinking about the PE Ratios for some of these tech companies in various ETFs. VGT from Vanguard for example or even VOO/VTI. I'm not too worried about the players like Apple, Microsoft, etc. They have always seemed to have such deamand that they run a PE in the 30s-50s. But some of these companies like AMD at PE 100, Broadcom 170, NVIDIA shooting up into the 50s so quickly with massive investment. Is just limited supply and crazy demand for these shares. Are you concerned as investors? I had to close out portfolios 5 years ago to go back to school and pay for it without taking on debt.

High P/E ratio tech stocks tend to be very speculative and volatile currently in the market. My personal view is there’s plenty of room for innovation, with growing demands for processing power and novel solutions to modern problems, not to mention the soon-to-be boom in quantum computing. I’m not a fan (at all) of the so-called ‘meme stocks’ or poor financial credentials, so stay well clear of speculation on ‘promising’ companies (aka I don’t listen to the media). I’ve stuck with VOO and Berkshire Hathaway, along with some small individual stock investments (albeit never more than 15% of my stocks&shares portfolio) for a diverse investment strategy, making the most of market upside potential and clear financial strength of specific entities and not had to worry about market volatility.

62,"Trading intuition exist, or am I just getting lucky?","Hi, I started investing 3 days ago and plan was to invest in nvidia but I discovered a penny stock with a lot of potential and decided to put $30 into it. The next day, when the market opened, I sold at the peak and doubled my money. Later that day, when people panic sold near the market close, I bought back the same amount of stock for the same price.

Today, I did the same thing again, though with slightly less profit. I’ve been focusing on just this one stock because the whole thing feels so surreal. I was literally sitting on the toilet, and with one click on my phone, I doubled my money, lmao. The next day, I almost tripled it again.

Lose 50% of your account and you need to make 100% to get back to breakeven. Lost 90% and you need to make 900%. Lose 100% and you are cooked. Keep that in mind.; It's luck. If you had $30,000 to invest instead of $30 would you have put it into that penny stock? What happened to you can happen for 20 straight days, and then suddenly...; Yeah, probably just luck. Penny stocks are a wild ride, and it’s easy to feel like a genius when you double your money on the toilet. 

Just don’t get too cocky, eventually the market smacks everyone; Haha you got lucky. You’ll blow your account very soon; Intuition does exist but it extremely rare and often related to a very thin and granular understanding of the market complexities. To the point where you could somewhat build a sound theory (no technical analysis nonsense) around it. 

That was the case for Soros theory on reflexivity or Livermore and his ability to “read the tape” 

But once again it is extremely rare and to validate if you have it or not, you should start formalising what you call intuition by writing down your observations and conclusions and what push you to put a trade on or not.; Ahhhh the feeling of taking credit for yourself while its being pure luck feeling so good ahhh; Give yourself 10 years and then see if it was intuition with some luck or just luck.

There's no intuition in the way you're describing this situation. Brownian motion is not intuitive. You can't just ""feel"" like you know where a particle will be at some point in time. If you could, you'd have changed math and physics forever.; You got lucky.

How do you minimize your risk while maximizing profits?; It is gambling, but that doesn’t mean you don’t have an edge. I know people who have this kind of intuition on meme stocks. Do you have any idea why you bought and sold when you did? Did you see something in the price action that made you think the stock was about to rise further?

While it is certainly possible you developed an intuition for this stock, this kind of intuition typically takes many years to develop. If you’re really only started 3 days ago, then I would attribute your gains to pure luck, and it’s best to look at it this way so that you don’t get cocky and take on more risk than you should.; What stock is it???

I would also say you should learn about position sizing first of all. You don't want to get wiped out and margin called on a handful of bad trades. Successful trading is about on average making money constantly over a prolonged period.

63,Why are my bond funds doing so poorly?,"My IRA consists of three index funds that have been doing really well, and three bond funds that have not. VTABX is down almost 12% over the last five years, VBTLX is down 14%, VWEAX is up 0.4% this year but down 9% over 5 years. I keep holding on to them thinking this is a long-term game and diversification is good. But I'm wondering if it wouldn't be better to roll this money into something more exciting like VOO or QQQ or individual big-name stocks like Apple, Amazon, Nvidia etc. These bond funds make up about 15% of my total IRA (around $8k out of $50k). Would love some honest feedback.

Edit: I'm in my early forties, have a healthy 401k ($150k), and don't mind some risk in trying to grow my IRA.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hiq5qp/why_are_my_bond_funds_doing_so_poorly/,37,2024-12-20 19:23:11,">VTABX is down almost 12% over the last five years

It is not.

You should never look at share price alone unless it is a company which has no dividend.  All that matters is total return.  That is true of equity ETF/MF but especially true of bonds which payout a signficant portion of lifetime earnings via dividends.

VTABX has a return of 0.12% on annualized basis over the last five years.  GRanted is pretty terrible.  Honestly I have no interest in foreign bonds.  Currency changes can have completely swamp any gains.

>VBTLX is down 14%

It is not. VBTLX total return is 0.04% CAGR.  Granted that is pretty bad but it shows how looking at share price along is worthless.

Now ~0% return is pretty bad but bonds went through the worst 5 years in the last 80. Typically returns are better although not particularly high.  Longterm return on total bond fund is around 2% real which with say 3% inflation would be 5% nominal.  There will years it does better but plenty of years it does worse too.; Why are bond funds doing poorly?

Bond funds typically hold bonds with varying maturities, at varying rates. When interest rates rise, bond funds typically *lose value*, because newly issued bonds will have higher interest rates than the bonds held in bond funds. With most of the world facing relatively elevated inflation, the expectation is that interest rates will remain higher than pre-2020 which means you would expect bond funds to have mediocre returns. 

Should you sell and shift to something more ""exciting?""

That depends on your investment goals and timelines. Given that this is your IRA (presumably Roth) I would aim to maximize total return to take advantage of the tax advantaged gains. If you're young (20s) I would argue that having any bonds is not optimal, but that's up to personal preference.

If you decided to hold bonds at some point, you should consider whether your initial reasoning for choosing to do so is still valid. Many people hold onto bonds not for the excitement of potential returns, but for the relative stability. If you feel like throwing caution to the wind and going all in on equities, that's perfectly fine.; Just about all bond funds are down in price from 5 years ago.  Rates were much lower 5 years ago.  As rates go up, price goes down. Long term bond funds are down the most.  the shorter the average term the less they are down.; Inflation dilutes the real yield. Lower rate bonds lose trading value.; You bought when rates were low.  Now rates are higher.  Therefore your bond funds are worth less.; If your bonds aren't doing well....that's a good thing ......  That means your stocks are doing well( better)....; I've never had bonds as part of my portfolio till just this year. I was talking with my MIL and she mentioned how she had significant losses over the past few years. That was my cue to buy a bit. Something things go on sale. I'll be DCAing into my bond funds over the next year and re evaluate then.; Maybe this is a silly question, but are you re-investing distributions, and if so, are you accounting for that in your assessment of them?   If you just look at gains in a UI in a brokerage the will not typically account for re-invested distributions.    They will never be as exciting as stocks but right now they are not terrible.  In a falling interest rate environment bonds are not bad.   When interest rates rise is when they are really bad (in the short term, over the long term it all averages out).; Need to understand the relationship of borrowing rate, fund ranking, years to maturity, demand vs supply etc.  Can not blindly own them hoping it works for you at all times.

VOO once was down -50.65 % within a few months that took 6 years to recover. As for QQQ one time it was down more than 1/3 prior year for 3 years in a row. It took 16 years to reach breakeven point.  Some of the big player like MSFT once it tanked so much took also 16 years to regroup. As for INTC it reached a peak at $75 well 23 years later it is at $19.52.

It takes more time and skills to understand bonds. I have a book on it. But each time there is another factor not considered.; I don’t invest in bonds to make money.  That’s what the stock market is for.  Bonds are “protection” for when the stock market tanks.  I can’t say I’ve done it as often as I wish, but in theory, when it tanks and I think the bottom has been had, then I’ll shift some bond money to the stock market tank and hope it helps make up for what’s been lost. Then rebalance before the bubble bursts again.; Timing-wise, bonds aren't doing so well after Fed Chair Powell signalled to the market that the fed planned fewer interest rate cuts than expected for 2025 this week. That caused yields to rise, meaning investors want more money for holding bonds, and things like bank rates on loans shot up as well. If you want to get nerdy about it, my book *Stock Market Sentiment, Structure & Game Theory: Essential Tools for Profiting from Trading and Investing*  goes over all the theory behind questions like these. My book would say that it's a good time to be in stocks, and lists \~50 ETFs from the examples in the book I cover, which are commonly used by financial advisors like Fidelity and Vanguard, and big money managers. It helps to sit down, read about the stock market once, and never feel like you have to do much because you read about it once. Over the last 5 years, investors have also suffered from higher interest rates because of inflation... which is why versus 2019, their market values would have fallen overall.; Are you considering their yield or just looking at the price? The price of bond funds won't move much over long periods of time. They should stay around par give or take % depending on their duration. Higher duration has a higher price variation but a more stable yield.

Bonds aren't for growth, they are for preservation. If you want growth, don't be in bonds.; Somethings in life you learn what not to do. Bonds and this diversify for the sake of not losing money when the market goes down just blows my mind......the oppurtunity cost far outweighs anything else.; Whatever you do, don't make SAA decisions based on trailing 5 years which is anything would tell you the inverse of what you want. ; How old are you?  Seems like you are too young to have that much allocated to bonds, but I don’t know your specific details. 

I was always taught bonds go up when stocks go down, but my 20 years of investment experience has taught me otherwise. What I’ve noticed is that bonds aren’t really an inverse of the stock market. Instead they lessen the big swings you’d see if you only held stocks. 

If you’re not near retirement, lessening the big swings isn’t really important yet. But it is important once you start nearing retirement.; Those wanting stability, hedging and reasonable returns have left intermediate and long term bonds since the firstborrow rate fall last fall (Sep 16). Right now wanting interest is CD.  Skilled investors already locked into individual bonds 15-20 years at above CD interest rate of 4.4%.; [removed]; Why? Bonds got trashed in 2022 when fed started monkeying around with interest rates to fight bidenflation. Long bonds got hit the hardest. Short bonds less bad.  You need to research your bond funds and look for the average duration. For example my long bond fund with vanguard has average duration of approx. 8 years. That means it could take 8 years to recover any lost principal. All you can do is set the dividends to reinvest, and sit back and wait and watch. They will eventually recover if you wait.  Or you can dump them now and write off the loss against your other gains.; A bond fund is not the same as a bond.i learned this years ago; Bond are safe but don't yield as much as something like an ETF. 

Couple that with the overall economic climate and inflation and you have your answer. 

Hard to tell what your portfolio should look like without understanding your goals and risk tolerance, it's likely best to chat with a financial advisor (an actual advisor and not just a talking head trying to sell some junk) and use that as input I to your strategy; Suggestion:  diversify into a managed commodity account.  The world has their money loaded in stocks and bonds.  Bad!  Invest where China has needs!  They have 5 times more people than America!  That’s where to look at!; Thanks for pointing that out. Good to know.; I agree on your points but it seems that a money market account would have done better almost across the board.

In fact, I’d choose a Swiss bond over US treasury most of the time; Early 40s.

And then reduces the interest rate when inflation drops. It doesn't water which party controles the white hose.; Morningstar has some good charting that includes interest & dividends. 

But your question is still a good one, and one I ask myself frequently. Bonds have just sucked for a long time now, including TIPS. 

I’m staying the course, but really kicking myself for not switching from bonds to cash (T-Bills, money markets, CDs, whatever) 4 years ago, and still wonder if that wouldn’t be the better move even now. 

But I’ll probably stay in bonds. *sigh*; In the short term sure.  The last 5 years have been some of the most brutal that bonds have every experienced.

Over the long run bonds have yielded about 2% real and cash (to include MMF, HYSA, short duration CDs, etc) have yielded about 0% real.

If you know the years where money market accounts will beat bonds and the reverse then you should definately keep money in cash during the years it beats bonds and then buy bonds before bonds beat cash.; Bond funds are longer duration, so they're smoothing out the swings in rate changes. When ultra short rates go higher than longer duration funds you can get a higher immediate rate, but that's also when the price of longer duration funds gets hit the hardest and therfore when you'll get more bang for your buck given some set period.

For example, if you look at a 20 year period, or whatever number, there will be times when ultra short rates are higher than a ladder based on that period, but there are times when they'll be lower and the average will be very similar to the ladder or longer duration fund because they're based on what the short term rate will be over that time. You can have a rate that varies between 1-5% over that time or you can get 3% the entire time.; Like a HYSA?; I can't predict the markets.  But one thing for sure, you will keep getting the dividend as long as nothing defaults.  And you are not down as much as a lot of long term bond funds are - some are down 30-40%.  Some folks are saying rates may continue up in the short term due to fed response to Trump Tariffs.  But in the long term, the almost have to come down because high rates are not sustainable by the US government due to deficit/debt issues.; No, give that you have an appropriate target allocation for your goals, the last couple years are when you should have been buying more bonds as the price is low because of higher short term rates and equities performing so well. You should have a plan and trust the process. Waiting for the performance of bonds to improve means it'll be too late because you've already lost value selling equities that are down and then you're paying more for bonds that are up in price.; You own bonds in the biggest bond bubble in human history. They will never match inflation if you are waiting for the yield. You can only increase your wealth in bonds by trading them or in arbitrage. High yield bonds can give you better returns for more risk. As a measure of inflation gold is compounding over 8% per year for 50 years. Bond yields are not even close.; Ok.  Are you accounting for this in your numbers?  With bond funds almost all of the growth is through distributions.; I’m in the same age group and the only bonds I have are I-bonds for my emergency fund. All of my retirement accounts are all equities. 

If you want to hold bonds, you might consider them. They aren’t traded, so they don’t ever go down in value. They have 2 different interest rates attached to them. One is a fixed rate that last the entire length of the bond, 30 years. And the other is a variable rate that is adjusted every 6 months to match the rate of inflation.; Most current fed officials have been appointed by dems. They owe their jobs and paychecks to dems.; Thanks for mentioning Morningstar. Are there any other websites that show interest& dividends? 🙏; >The last 5 years have been some of the most brutal that bonds have every experienced.

Depends on which one. Funds based on short term government bonds have done ok the last few years (SGOV, TBLL, etc). SPHY and some of the high interest bond funds have been alright too, when adjusted for total return. I-bonds have given fairly lucrative returns for a few years too.; [Gold did nothing but lose value for almost 30 years.](https://testfol.io/?s=aZwvVBAO3q6); Not only that but if you are rebalancing you are using the boring money to buy the dips. Can’t buy a dip if everything you have dips too. :); Generally speaking SGOV and the like as well as HYSA, MMF, short duration CD and short duration t-bills are considered cash not bonds.  Cash and bond behave differently.  Cash has done pretty well the last five years.  Bonds have not.; What a dumb take. You selecting a specific timeframe only proves you have a bias. Nixon took us off the gold standard in 1971. Thats when gold was unhooked to the dollar. A specific event.; Cash - actual cash - has depreciated terribly. Double digits some years depending on your inflation measure. 

Short term treasury bonds have helped stymie some of that for many folks.; So? I selected 1980, not 1971.; Cash in investing terms does not mean a wad of dollar bills in a coffee can.

>Cash in investing refers to money held in a bank account or other short-term investments with little to no market risk and a maturity of 90 days or less.

Likewise when someone says Apple has ~$120B in cash they don't mean Apple has bilions of $20 bills rolled up with rubber bands stored in a locker somewhere.  Apple holding $120B in cash means primarily they are holding t-bills.

Nobody calls a 90 day t-bill a bond.  Nobody calls a HYSA a bond.  Nobody calls a MMF a bond.  They are cash.  Yes cash has done relatively well over the last 5 years but that is atypical.  The longterm return on cash is about 0% real."

I've been hearing about how everything's about to tank and it's the worst time in history to buy every other month since like 2015.  If we can hold out for a couple more years it'll be roughly a decade's worth of everybody screeching about an impending recession.

It just seems to me like it will crash more than it has. I think there are some hardships coming that have yet to happen. But it also seems like there are enough people in power now willing to prevent a lot of that, and that's what I was basing it on, that and listening to others who've predicted it, like Buffet seems to be acting in that direction.

Lol.  The fact that you can type this, alone, means that you simply don't operate in reality and everything you say can be totally disregarded.

Your opinions are not valid because they weren't formed on this planet, and you're clearly  not observing jack shit other than exactly what you want to observe.  No one is obligated to treat your made up fantasy world with the same weight as stuff that's going on in reality, just to avoid iNsULtiNg your inane beliefs.; Yeah?; 3% =30% for people who started investing in 2023.; People ridicule what they cannot comprehend. 

Because you don't understand discipline and chain of command and think its all just ""Yes men"" then you must also think that all military soldiers, seal teams, delta force, green berets etc, etc..  ..the worlds biggest ass kickers ..are just ""yes men"" ..

65,Could GOEV (Canoo Inc.) Be a Hidden Gem and at a Place When Tesla Was at $1.33 Only or When Bitcoin was but Mere Cents Only?,"Hi investing friends, could GOEV (Canoo inc., I've bought quite a significant number of shares at least significant for the budget; always with cross-referencing do your own research and trust your own instincts after the data, always doing due diligence and this is not financial advice) be a hidden gem and now at a place when Tesla was at $1.33 or when BTC was mere cents (Bitcoin even started at $0) about a decade and a half ago? It was ignored coz' no one was buying much. It's always tough to see looking forward (it's always looking back of course that one see gems that could be hidden), though I always look at who's creating what, who's the real leader and Canoo's leader seems maybe a few percentages of Elon Musk. 

The Canoo founder has a lot of patents it seems, innovative it seem similar to Elon (but not as big like Elon's pre-Tesla and SpaceX, like PayPal or Zip2) had a successful venture (Solera I think). 

But only time will tell if the pattern will repeat itself with Canoo, it has a great design, innovative, especially their MPDV (I wish that was the one they focused on but had a smaller non-van version with the same). It just needs to launch already their working models (unlike that Nikola truck which even got GM fooled) have amazing design especially the shelf mechanism of their nice looking MPDV. 

If they just did a pre-order which is a genius strategy pioneered by amazing Apple, God-willing they will break through but they also need to upgrade their battery from 200mi to 320mi for good measure. They need to launch now coz' the chinese EVs are coming with tariffs by Pres. Trump or not- it's like 'finished or not finished pass your papers.' 

God bless traders and investors.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hip93e/could_goev_canoo_inc_be_a_hidden_gem_and_at_a/,0,2024-12-20 18:43:49,"This kinda looks like a pending bankruptcy to me... and if not then 10 rounds of dilution...; No. Get out while you can.

This trash is going to 0; they just furloughed a bunch of workers around christmas, not a great look.  I think they also shut down a factory.  Super risky so maybe small size is the play here; Scam company. I have never owned any stock in them but I've been watching for a while. They've never made any actual cars. They just have other companies make 3-4 show cars and deliver them at a huge cost to themselves. They have a bunch of production equipment in Oklahoma and no one knows how to set it up. Somehow they have 170 engineering employees in California that are paid to sit on their ass and do nothing all day. But they have no cash on hand and are diluting like crazy to survive because no one is dumb enough to invest in them. Absolute trainwreck.

I'd love to buy God willing their cool looking MPDV (a smaller version which I suggested, though that van is the coolest) which has a nice beveled edge and cool lights. It's probably what a Tesla CyberVan, if they made one (though that may well  should look like.

Also if they've given up, they wouldn't try to not get it delisted by opting for a 1-for-20 split. A lot of companies' stocks were around that much (about a dollar or less) for a very long time, around a decade or so like Tesla or NVDA.

If Canoo would only launch already, I know (strong conviction) they will do great (not Tesla big, Elon Musk in a way is an anomaly, his Musk Enterprises hedges the companies within it), God willing. 

Instincts (after comparing it to known scams and successes) tell me I should buy more, it just needs that one break- a pre-ordered launch so it can control it's inventory. If it goes bankrupt God forbids, although my shares a significant for me, I've hedged things, it's not the top in the portfolio. GOEV, Canoo Inc. could have the pattern of an Amazon or an NVDA or a Tesla, Apple as well (though some price have to be adjusted for inflation) which had low price stocks for 10-16 years (not to the heights they became but the gut feel just tells it, pray I'm not wrong :-D ✝️🙏🏼).

Thanks for reading.; You didn't address anything I said in my comment. But alright then, good luck to you. Also ironically Nikola is actually shipping a product, unlike canoo; Nikola never had a working prototype, they just filmed a video on a road that goes downward, Canoo is different but of course lots of Hail Mary's (Arrival EV which went bust which Canoo got their tooling from is different- nothing innovative but buses take more resources to make. They're MPDV is a great design. Though I understand, let's pray and hope this is like Apple  when it's stock was at 2006 and then Steve Jobs came ()who knew) :-) It's pure instincts now- it really just needs to do a pre-order.

Also their stock is practically $0 why don't they just file for bankruptcy like Arrival, which for me is they are going to make a move, I don't think their CEO is quitter."

67,The Current State of the Stock Market in 2024: How Should We Navigate the Ever-Changing Market Environment?,"Hello everyone, as I've been observing the stock market lately, I've noticed that the volatility has been increasing. Especially in 2024, the market seems harder to predict, and many investors seem to be taking a “wait and see” approach, as there doesn’t appear to be much certainty. Tech stocks are still performing well, but they are also facing significant pressure to adjust, while traditional industries are more stable, though they lack explosive growth potential.

Firstly, tech stocks continue to be the darlings of the market. Companies like **Apple**, **NVIDIA**, and **Tesla** have attracted a lot of capital due to their strong performance and promising outlooks. However, we must face a reality: have these companies reached their peak valuations? In the past few years, the rise in tech stocks has made many investors a lot of money, but now the market seems to be undergoing a revaluation cycle. With macroeconomic uncertainties and rising interest rates, the overall valuation pressure on the market is intensifying.

Additionally, the rise in interest rates is certainly a major issue. The Federal Reserve's rate hikes, while aimed at combating inflation, have far-reaching consequences. The increased cost of borrowing is squeezing both consumer spending and investment, which poses a threat to the earnings expectations of many companies. Recently, some once-strong consumer goods and retail stocks have reported disappointing earnings, especially those companies that rely on cheap capital, which may face even greater challenges.

That being said, I also see some opportunities. Companies with solid performance and strong cash flow, particularly dividend stocks, have become especially attractive in this environment. The uncertainty in the market has made many high-risk, high-volatility stocks more unreliable, while a more conservative investment strategy seems to be better suited. For investors looking for long-term returns, perhaps it’s time to focus less on short-term gains and more on stocks with strong risk-resilience.

Overall, the stock market in 2024 is truly filled with both challenges and opportunities. Investors need to approach it with a calmer mindset, more patience, and a solid asset allocation strategy, without blindly chasing short-term hot stocks or trends. What do you all think? How are you adjusting your investment strategies in the current market environment? Feel free to share your thoughts and experiences.

**Conclusion**: This post is just my personal perspective, and it may not be entirely accurate, but I believe everyone in the market has their own unique insights. I hope this sparks more discussion, and perhaps together we can identify some truly worthwhile investment opportunities in this volatile market!",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hild07/the_current_state_of_the_stock_market_in_2024_how/,3,2024-12-20 15:48:02,"

It is a great product, but buying expensive will decrease by a big margin your gains. 

Saying that I have them in my watch list.; It was at 280 half a year ago. No thanks.; I've been selling.  Will keep some as a long-term position but not buying here at all.

I don't disagree with anything you said but the stock was up about 75% going into the election (which, in any name is an awfully good year in/of itself) then post-election proceeded to go up about another 56% in a matter of about a month before pulling back. It's still up 150% YTD.

Primary concern that I have is that it feels like you have a handful of things that people believe are ""easy money"" because of the election. For those who were on here in late 2020, there was also a lot of discussion that the clean energy ETF was ""easy money"" because of Biden. So you had the ICLN etf go up about 55% between the election and the first week of January, pulling forward considerable growth. People thought it was easy money because of Biden, but bought the shit out of it to the degree that it created a mini bubble and the top was right before inaguration. Clean energy then ran into other issues (inflation/higher rates), but for all the ""easy money"" discussion, it really never did well from the get go during the Biden administration.

Not apples to apples obviously but I do think that with a few things viewed as beneficiaries of a Trump election, the market has indiscriminately bought to the point where it's once again pulling forward a lot before the administration even starts. I don't know that this plays out like clean energy at all looking over the coming years, but in the very short-term you've priced in a lot. A *lot lot* especially when it got towards $700. 

If AXON got back into the $300's I'd look at adding some back.; Is this dip in the room with us? I don't see it; AXON is being added to the NASDAQ 100 (QQQ) during its upcoming reconstitution.

Is a massive grow but for 2026 is expected to go to $4.65, they will need to figure out how to generate all the income to justify a valuation of 40 billions. 

  
Way to expensive, should be around 10 - 20B.; Wasn't comparing companies/business models at all, which I noted above. Was comparing similar post-election ""FOMO"" buying (the degree of which is pulling a lot of the perceived benefit forward before the administration even gets into office) based upon belief that something would be major beneficiary/""easy money"" given election results. That's all.; Nobody thought META would drop 70% in 2022. It's just math. AXON needs a 10 year compounded FCF growth rate of 33% to justify the current stock price. That sounds insane to me.; That's obvious, nor was I saying anyone should. I've been a member of the top service for years, and have bought maybe 5 recommendations total, out of about 100 they've made.; Well done.; Retail ain’t dumb, people are dumb !!!; I know. I’m just pointing out that SaaS businesses are booming right now and have been, I don’t think that’s going to stop anytime soon; Blah blah blah 🙄; I didn't mean to sound degrading, sorry if I came across that way.  I have never subscribed to Motley Fool but have considered it.  Would you recomend it?; No worries. I would have recommended it (the motley fool stock advisor) a couple years go but the guy that IMO was the best stock picker retired from it. I still value it as a source for stock ideas but I take it less seriously than I did."

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

My $592 call expiring today that I bought yesterday early afternoon was down 90% at open. Just sold it for 130% profit.; Looking pretty grim out there. 

Going to be headed to the proctologist to get the lump of coal removed  

No Santa Rally this year.; PCE comes in lower than expected at 2.4.


IMO, for today specifically, we're probably still doomed anyway because of options market dynamics, but we're set up to probably bounce next week post OPEX.; I had my heart race a little when i saw Lilly being up 9% out of nowhere and got excited, next moment i see Novo 22% down (holding both). Everything else deep red as well.; Gov Shutdown brilliant; Looks like a bad day coming due to gov shutdown, fed guidance, and low Xmas volume; santa's sprinkling his magic dust over the stock exchange!; Health, energy, and staples have been in a drawdown if people are looking for value there.; Ok so I know absolutely nothing about the stock market.; Did Mark Zuckerberg shoot someone?

wtf; Rough on NVO, will buy more when I can seems like an overreaction to me, but valuation was high enough its deserved I suppose; I dropped 6k US into schg and goog earlier in the week.

That sounds good for several boring companies that dont get discussed much on sub such as JPM, GS, MS. Or the companies that buyout such as BX, KKR, APO, etc.

There already news WBD begining the process to sell the Polish network TVN today.; This is not news if you go deep into coal/oil/gas, but the [IEA once again admits its forecasts on peak coal are premature.](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-12-18/we-re-burning-more-coal-than-ever-thanks-to-china?utm_source=website&utm_medium=share&utm_campaign=twitter?sref=5dj0X2VO)

""Coal demand set a record high in 2024"", at ""8,771 million metric tons this year, up 1% from 2023"". Moreover, they revised up 2023's demand from 8563 million tons to 8,687, ""The difference equals roughly the annual demand of Japan, the world’s fourth-biggest coal consumer."" The IEA is predicting demand to continue rising the next 3 years, although their estimated increase is small. The revision of estimates for 2026 in the span of 1 year has increased by the annual demand of the US and Japan combined.

[Visualize previous forecasts and the historical trend](https://i.imgur.com/uSWpbQd.png).

[Here is geographic consumption in 2024](https://i.imgur.com/rqAFTep.png). China/India are the dominant players here. 

The world still burns 10 dump trucks of coal ever second, or a Great Pyramid of Giza every 6 hours ([source](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-07-25/climate-crisis-old-king-coal-remains-omnipotent-and-omnipresent?sref=5dj0X2VO)).

Coal will continue its decline in the US and most of Europe. But those countries need more energy period, as well as storage capacity. Though there was a recently a major power 'crisis' in Europe because of dunkelflaute, where the wind/solar output simultaneously fall. As a consequence, Germany and a few other countries were drawing substantially from their neighbors grids, causing everyone's power to go up. The electricity price in Germany literally 10xed its average on one of those day. Norway/Sweden faced similar spikes and were naturally very annoyed by this. [To put in context, the power prices increased so much that a 10 minute shower in Sweden = $5]

Averaged over 2023, you can see [UK and Germany industry](https://i.imgur.com/Yj9MLVH.jpeg) are facing much worse costs than peers around the world. It's pretty remarkable how cheap electricity in the US is if you consider it's income per capita is much higher than say Argentina or India but we have cheaper energy.

As for this ongoing winter, [Europe seems to be drawing on its natural gas storage](https://www.thecommoditycompass.com/p/european-natural-gas-and-electricity) quite quickly. This article focuses mostly on the Netherlands/Germany/UK. You can see for example, [that a period of dunkelflaute](https://i.imgur.com/XoGMk9C.jpeg) in November caused Dutch storages to drop by 20%. Europe doesn't have infinite storage, so if they draw down on storages entirely, expensive LNG imports + demand destruction have to fill the gap.; America is too joyful of a place to have a correction before Christmas. Glad I was born here. 🙏
The Bogleheads, the stock pickers, the traders, the degenerates are all happy. 
Next year is next year’s problem. Merry xmas everyone!; What the fuck is going on.; Good chance to buy SBUX with the strike + down market. Trading around it's 5Y rn.; Huzzah for good earnings out of microcaps!; Added more $NVO today. My only regret is being asleep when it flash crashed into the 70s.

Closed out $NXT and $ENVX. Just don’t fully believe in their future like I did when I purchased them. Took profits and put it into the below two

Started position in $BX and $OXY. Needed some diversification in my portfolio. M&A will be easier going forward for $BX. Took me seeing Warren Buffett buying $OXY all year long for me to finally do some DD on the company; Here comes a monster bull run to end the year; It's put the phone away day; RIP bears 💀; It's over. Volatility crushed, back to new ATH soon. There really is unlimited money that will jack up stock prices for eternity no matter the price. And any $10 drop is seen as the opportunity of a lifetime. Doesn't matter the price. Just the fact that it drops at all brings in fomo buyers. Even when the market is double from here it will have the same fomo dip buying when it drops 2%.; [deleted]; Fucking A just stop bleeding..hilarious how it takes 4 months to get us here and in 2 days it’s gone. Always stairs up, base jump down..

Even fucking bitcoin something that should in theory be going higher with a government shutdown is deep in the red

Powell is the ultimate grinch this year; Wow, Biden's economy really is great.; Hardly ever do these type of trades, but bought some NVO in the premarket; QCOM's lawyers are a different breed...; – Vertiv (NYSE: VRT), a global provider of critical digital infrastructure and continuity solutions, today announced the acquisition by its Chinese subsidiary of certain assets and technologies of BiXin Energy Technology (Suzhou) Co., Ltd (BSE), a manufacturer of chillers, heat pumps, heat-recovery solutions and air-handling units. Focused on expanding the Vertiv chiller family, the acquisition strengthens Vertiv’s portfolio of critical technologies and solutions in support of high-performance compute and AI applications globally.

Insane run; Anyone else considering full porting into PLTR and TSLA because they have successfully purchased the United States Federal Government? Just me; [deleted]; SPY green; Alsea up nicely in Mexico, so far OMAB and WALMEX working nicely, still red on Alsea for now; Its perfectly normal for a $180B stock like palantir to move from -5% to +6% on a day without any news. Casual $20B swing or 8x years of sales removed and added in the span of four hours. ; Is the stock market at this point completely desensitized from the possible government shutdown?; [deleted]; Why does PFE keep falling? Their mom COVID revenue is back to growing, debt is falling, margin is improving and yield is high; All that freak out about literally nothing lol; NVO is now almost half of LLY's valuation. Being an American company in the stock market comes with insane privilege.; lol and now another stock of mine is massively down (NVO) just like that 

What an awful year, it’s been…; PLTR held up surprisingly well during the bloodbath this week. At 170B market cap I guess institutions control the stock. Retail no longer has the ability to add or subtract 35-40B. It up to the big money.; Can someone explain to me what's going on I'm very stupid 


So first that Jerome guy came few days ago and shitted on everyone's calls by cutting interest rates or increasing them? so that's a bad sign for companies usually leading to the drop.
Then now we had some inflation data were back up? How? So there are inflation reports and interest rate reports both in December?; Holy shit AMD and NVDA gap keeps widening. AMD loses more on red days and barely recovers.; Welp, I tried diversifying into European pharma a bit and bought NVO last week ago. Should have just stuck with LLY.; How the hell do Europeans build wealth? I decided to diversify into Europe a couple months ago and oh boy, that wasn't my best idea ever.; What % of a diversified ETF portfolio do you guys think should be in small caps?

""This has been an incredibly strong finish to a record year. Revenues hit an all-time high driven by a strong demand environment that we elevated throughout the year, enabling us to outperform our initial 2024 guidance by $700 million and deliver nearly $2 billion more to the bottom line, year over year,"" commented Carnival Corporation & plc's Chief Executive Officer Josh Weinstein. ""The progress was broad based as we drove strong pricing in 2024 as compared to 2023 across our major cruise lines and trades.""

Always such an expensive stock.; Solar loving that pce; Is PTON the king of cyclical (nice) stocks? I seem to see it around $3.50 every august and for the last few holiday seasons the price hits around $8. It’s like clockwork. I think this next year I’m finally gonna pull the trigger on some positions. Thoughts??; META actually down; I'd be surprised if the META movement wasn't options day related as it's one of the more popular tech names, so it likely gets lots of call option buying (the Broadcom movement probably also is and it's why I wasn't a fan of it going as crazy as it did last week and Monday).

For that matter, we're seeing exactly why I didn't want the resurrection of TSLA to occur, because if it blows up, it can shove around the indexes, both on the upside and the downside (and it blowing up might end up being an indicator of a high coming soon, but it's too early to tell).

Edit: And I suspect it's not done going lower for the time being, but I did say this morning that I suspect any rallying is not going to be led by tech anyway in the short term at least.; Jerome says Merry Christmas.; Strongest Bull market of all time. See, it was impossible for this thing to stay down. Had to have a massive rip. And before you know it, will be back at ATH. Simply impossible to bring this market down. Yes, I know it dropped, but it's already on it's way back and we are making the V.; Which stock save your ass on last couple month?

My vote for pltr tsll(tsla) pton; [deleted]; just barely green today... 😥; So..


BigBear is next Palantir. 
AVGO is next NVDA.
HUBS is next CRM.
MU is next 1T.
Uber is next Waymo.


Correct? Nice that we forgot Wednesday's 700 point drop, and looking forward to next winners 😆; C'mon Palantir, close at $80+! 


You can do it!; aapl has such big dick energy ngl; Sp500 up still around 25% for the year and down not even 1% in premarket.  The sky is not falling.; Made some money today, it was a good day. Thinking of putting 20k in META next week for a quick scalp? 1-2%; To the surprise of no one (except FOMO retail investors) quantum computing bubble is popping hard.

fuuuuuck me; I don't know that this is actually a longer term high, but if it turns out to be, it's exactly why I didn't want TSLA to wake up.


The craziness by it and unfortunately my doll, AVGO (ha), might signify an intermediate top though.; Critique my strategy: BTFD on non-shitcos at -2x ATR; Can adobe fall 50-75%? I thought 15% was the limit but it is now down 30%; Any app to check returns of a stock with or without dividends from a given date?; Is XBI worth buying with yield at 0.14 and expense ratio at 0.35?; Why is $PTN going up so much?; We're so back. Dollar cost averaged all my FWRG in these dips.; Looks like we’re gonna end the week a bit softer due to lower volume and gov shutdown risk; I suspect as time wears on, that Monday of this week is going to look like mid July of this year involving tech names.

Maybe it doesn’t occur without Powell’s speech, or is at least delayed, but it goes to show you that you can’t get as imbalanced as we did without consequences. 

I should’ve figured this, but I think we bottom Monday and then don’t have tech lead for the remaining trading days. Don’t think this is all OPEX related, but 6k breaking on the S&P is consequential on OPEX week, and it seems likely now that we’d have just stayed flat without Powell mentioning inflation.; These small cap, momentum stocks are gonna be the first to get hit hard. Large caps will follow. We’ve got some red days in front of us fellas.

Buckle up and dca; Nice turnaround. Santa Rally is back on!; Just read through Evercore's NKE analysis. They ""still think"" $4 in per share income is possible in 2028. Is it me or does that sound pretty underwhelming given the other opportunities out there? Basically saying nke will spend $5 billion in ""demand generation"" marketing to regain self space and citing that there are no competitors that can go toe to toe with marketing spend like that..... Arriving at the conclusion that big spending and ""innovation"" will win the day. I get it that there are only a few large cap consumer discretionary plays but being called the ""most important recovery story in consumer discretionary"" doesn't sound right to me. But im just a punk on reddit; Has Tesla ever done a stock buyback in its history?

I tried to look this up online, but I could not get a conclusive answer. Has Tesla ever done a stock buyback and its history?; [removed]; I can’t help but laugh at all the bag holders being created. Ionq, qbit, rklb and other shitcos. It’s just so funny lmao. Stonks only go up, until they don’t lmaoo; santa rally starting early; TSLA closed near $420 for some max pain; Looking like Red today; is this a good time to buy INTEL?

Not even gone write too much, but just wanted to know are are we all seeing intel situation right now. 

what can really save them?
Is this a great discount (time to buy)?; Very interesting how SPY got rejected at exactly 609.997; Yep, buy time; Such an overreaction for Novo tbh. Trial test results are 22.5% vs 25% and it make the market goes into a -22% ? Crazy.

As someone currently holding a lot of cash and gold, I won't complain but it just confirms a really fragile and volatile market.; i sold all of my LLY last night i always walk the wrong path straight into a tree; nailed it. 

especially healthcare - something that never goes away. 

alot of high dividend healthcare stocks have been killed on all fronts by 1) Trump Win 2) UNH assassination 3) health just being in general out of favor most of the year 4) end of year tax loss harvesting. 

example - PFE keep releasing better and better guidance and the stock barely responds and is basically at a 12 year low (for obvious reasons though); Kind of a fun fact, no one really does either. People that trade, will us TA, but that isn't 100%. It's mainly just an educated guess based on everyone using the same psychology. 

Usually that's why the best way to make money is just to buy and hold. Index funds/etfs being the easiest way, since you takes you zero time and research. Plus you just perform how the market does.; Fundamentals, earnings, governments, government shutdowns don't matter. The only  thing that matters is how much debt costs.; I just DCA weekly and see what happens. If stocks go down great cheaper shares. If they go up also great but you get left with wishing you bought more when the shares were cheaper.; It will also be interesting, whether their ""retake"" of the phase 3 trial next year, will show a weightloss over 25% as they expected. The retake of phase 3 will be done in a more controlled manor in terms of dosage; Both are great long term holds. Don’t sell either ever. Mark my words; Nope but the market could have gone the other way and I would be standing here naked.  

Triple witching day, its always a wild day;; I bought a bit. Could have backfired of course. Could still.; Sold some before tanking.  Mostly rebalancing.; I posted something months ago about I think Waymo and self driving cars are way underrated. Like it's something that feels really futuristic, but is here.

One poster was basically trying to dunk on me around it lol.

Waymo and Youtube are the actually the reasons I own Google over search or AI. Like I personally watch more Youtube than TV and the numbers for like GenZ are pretty scary in terms of hours watched. It's something that competitors really can't re-create either.

  
Edit: 

Here's the comment where the user dogged on me for calling out how cool Waymo is lol

I just don’t have the heart to rebalance due to how well it’s done.; Plus santa coal demand; > To put in context, the power prices increased so much that a 10 minute shower in Sweden = $5

Wouldn’t putting it in context include that wages are $50/hour in Norway; Looks like you posted this and the market started to reverse, kind of amazing that sort of power; Hell yeah brother. American exceptionalism is back in full swing. Everyone is happy except for CELH and AMD holders (me lol). But I'm beating SPY YTD so can't complain too much. And my net worth just passed $1m at 34.; Congrats on getting out of $envx. Hoping it at least rises to my cost basis one day. Would love to dump that bag; Showing the low of the day as $81.50; Yep,

Im still in on Microsoft, tech, and I dont' see it pulling back yet in certain stocks.  

Continuing to pivot out slowly to financial services and ride that till February.  

Could be wrong easily, thats my plan though.; haha i thought I recognised the ""v guy"" from your name, and turned out i was right.; How to monetize the social media ADD addled masses as an investor.; If there was volatility index on volatility.. that'd probably be fun.

Yummy; Maybe crypto isn't a good hedge, it's three tech stocks in a trenchcoat posing as a hedge.; 
>Even fucking bitcoin something that should in theory be going higher with a government shutdown is deep in the red

Citation needed; There is zero reason to believe Bitcoin should go higher with a shutdown or even during hard economic times for that matter. In fact, it makes more sense for it to crash even harder as its only value is pure speculation.; I think retail investors are using margin and leveraged instruments to buy riskier assets so when they get sold off by larger institutions retail gets margin called.  Rinse and repeat. ; Are the bags heavy?; Bitcoin is worthless and many US large cap stocks are overvalued.; Pretty fucking demoralizing isn't it?

Have gotten to the point where I am seriously starting to look at my retirement, and am going to be contributing to it pretty heavily over the next 20 months.

 Am heavy into Meta, have been for the last 6-8 years, and it's just been getting beat on, like you said back to October levels is just depressing. I'm still way up, but yea red is no fun. 

Going to be starting my Roth and contributing the max and was going to start adding to my brokerage account, but now I'm thinking, contribute to the roth and let the money sit there, so I can catch up, starting it late, but then just keep funneling more into my HY savings account and take the 4.7%, all this red is just fucking awful.; Sounds like the actual result was 22.5% weight loss instead of an expected 25%.  Sell off does seem a bit much.; Same. IMO a complete overreaction. 22.7% vs 25% isn’t that significant of a difference in someone who’s 250 lbs (comes out to be losing 5 more pounds). 

At the end of the day, it’s still an effective drug and LLY and NVO are the only players in this market for at least 1-2 more years. 

NVO is still going to do very very well overall; It has a long way to go to get 230 back; I doubt this one will go through in US because they may be viewed as too much of risk for the US in light of the TP-Link internet routers issues.; For my own sanity I hope that you are wrong.; I like it. Looking for possible entry post inauguration if the tariff threats get loud again.; In at 58.47 average. Should’ve bought more at the time. Only bought it because my SO is in love with everything Shark or Ninja. House is full of their brands. Good quality for the price IMO

There was a short report on it a month ago that you should look into if you’re considering buying to get an opposing point of view; I normally max 2 roths Jan 3rd but i may wait lol; I always said there's no moat w the fat pills; NVO just announced a share repurchase program maybe that will pump the stock.; U shoulda done that before election, now it's priced in.; Pltr has now become over 80% of my account. I also have 3 TSLA shares so I'm basically there; Buying back in pltr after it drops next week; >he fell for the boglehead international stock meme; It's a small percentage of my portfolio but I think next year I'm going to switch to specific intl stocks vs the whole fund approach; It's a perfectly fine ETF and valuations are very reasonable, unlike the massive bubble in US large caps. I'd much sooner buy more VXUS than VOO at this time.; shhhh

It’s been tradition to threaten a government shutdown as a negotiation tactic for a minute now; Priced in; Seems like a relatively small miss on data (22% vs 25% weight loss) for such a big reaction - are you buying NVO here?; NVO is more profitable too. Makes no sense; No, the valuation for LLY is based its pipeline, many in high TAM categories.; Sorry to hear it. Hope things get better remainder of the year/next year - good luck.; Just buy tech. Everything else goes up and down and you end up being breakeven and dead; The place I work at started using Palantir last week. Now that I have first hand knowledge I realize so many on this sub were speaking on the company without using the software. Also the others who have first hand knowledge were silent all these years to not correct the errors people made.

The company I work at didnt get an article made about this deal like all the government ones do.; Don’t understand why. Completely insane valuation. ; I bought a ton on it's first day of trading ($10.xx), watched it shoot up and then sink back down within a couple of years and bailed on all of it, thinking I'd get back in when the time looked right. Back then I remember reading an opinion that sounded correct, that this co's stock would probably languish for a few years, then explode up towards 10x. It did. I didn't. Oh well.; Lower inflation = good. Rate cut = good. Rate cuts happening slower or lesser in frequency = bad. Inflation data comes monthly. Interest rate decisions every few months. Sometimes they happen on same month. Hence we saw bad --> good in short succession.; AMD short-term technically quite a bit oversold and probably being pretty impacted by end of year loss selling.  

Beyond that, there was the trade late last year until around March where people were clearly hoping that AMD would catch up to some meaningful degree to NVDA.  That faded in the Spring when it was clear it wasn't happening and earnings reports have been.... ""fine"", ""good, but"", etc. Short-term could certainly bounce especially towards the end of month and early next year, but beyond that people are going to go, ""Why don't I just own NVDA or AVGO?"" and AMD has yet to make enough of a case to people.; next -  AMD to 95 NDA to 200. 

AVGO winning TSM winning.

semis is super competitive and AMD is losing it's edge fast.

time to put it in the winners, dump your AMD for NVDA/AVGO and touch it until they can prove the growth story.

AMD the new INTEL.; I am just hoping the market is overreacting. Their new drug promises 22.7% weight loss vs. expected 25%.  
Look at Nike yesterday, good numbers, stock jumps, just for it to drop into nirvana some hours later...Hoping there's some turnaorund for Novo the other way around now, market is crazy today.; Own American companies...

Enjoy free healthcare and lots of vacation time. 

Repeat. 

Not a terrible deal, in all fairness.; Unless it's some sort of glitch on the Yahoo Finance app...; Wait for the shakeout; It's the last of the huge user base social media sites you can own early.

If it drops, I will acquire more.  Reddit will have to reall6 fuck up its AI and advertising strategies to not become a 150-300 billion dollar company at least.; Its pretty richly valued right now if you look at earnings and numbers. Biggest issue being its not proven itself consistently profitable and could be vulnerable to interest rate decisions. 

I wouldn't but at this price...but the market itself if richly priced right now so you do you.; Id love to have been able to grab some of that premarket action, was under $10 for a sec; They've always been like too pricey for me to want to take the plunge. I do have some exposure in the space, but it's mainly through $CW and $DSR. 

CW is on the pricier side, but I bought them like a year ago. Big thing for me is that they have nuclear exposure. 

One of things I've added to my investment thesis is getting exposure to naval components, due to the fact the US is behind China in ship building. We will need to invest more. 

That's kind of why I like DRS as well.; Just dumped makes no sense at all.

3 months' worth of gains gone in 3 days.; Stock just has such strange movement day to day. Big daily swings on no news is normal for it.; Last minute witching action clearly favored aapl nvda and dingdonged meta and tsla; I believe it will drop to 550.  It doesn't mean to sell, I am bullish on it but thats just me.  It was trending down on witching day so it should pull back healthily on its next leg up.; > it was impossible for this thing to stay down

And by ""this thing"", let's just say. Ha ha.

My peanits.; Are you still puts/short/cash or did you give up?; PLTR and AVGO; Last 2 months? Almost everything is up my friend.; IonQ and RocketLabUSA have been very kind to me this year.; LUNR RBRK DAVE CFLT; A few stocks:

Sprouts Farmers Market

Rocket Lab

Cloudflare

Even Dardens Restaurant had a great earnings call yesterday and saved my portfolio from going red lol.; Are there really any Discounts atm?; When has anyone said Uber is next Waymo lmao.

I thought it was Google is the better company. Uber is one going out of business with Waymo expansion soon.; You got your wish!; Most people here didn’t buy in 2024; That move matches your name perfectly. 20k risk for a 2% gain; I have a friend that trades like this with a cash account, rarely takes losses but never makes enough to stop complaining about not making decent gains. So in an attempt to increase his gains he just opened an options account. It totally blows my mind with the risk vs reward logic to consider options trading if you’re only shooting for 2-3% in a cash account…. either way good luck with this meta play I’m sure you could find a 2% in intraday,  just watch out the chart had dead cat bounces on Thursday and Friday.; What do you mean? Ionq up past week and year close to 500%, people making bank. I doubt the retail investors are sad about that ; I bought Amazon ATH in August of 2022 at 134. I'm now up 5k on the stock. Time in the market is better than timing the market. You'll be fine; I put 15K in 2022 Jan 3rd. It happens lol; not an app but totalrealreturns.com might be helpful to you; Will be interesting to see. A big part of NKE's story was the previous CEO and the move to direct to consumer during the pandemic. 

Like during that time period, they moved away from innovation. I can only go off my own experience, but I did recently buy some ON shoes over Nike since none them where that nice. I would be happy to buy Nike again if they made better shoes. 

I think the other aspect is the new CEO worked up to the position from being in the company. Which I think is a good thing. 

However, I'm not the biggest fan of investing in retail companies. Also not a fan of investing in turn around stories. 

It does seem like the sports market is huge and only getting bigger. Like the most watched live events were NFL games.; All the arguments for why NKE will bounce back seem to be based on their brand and hope. The power of that brand has weakened over time. I just don’t see enough to want to invest in it, but a number of people feel differently. We’ll find out who’s right 📈📉; I feel like the heyday of NKE's marketing is over. They struck gold with Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, and ""Just Do It"". GenZ doesn't view them in the same light.; [removed]; [removed]; [removed]; To each their own. 

I think speculating is fine as long as it’s done responsibly. There is money to made. 

I’m personally long RKLB. Would never suggest buying at these levels, but I’m up over 500% on my investment because of that speculation. 

I tend to buy stuff based off fundamentals, but have been a big fan of the company. Been posting about them being my lotto ticket for years here. 

I think it’s better to help each other try to make money. ; Rklb still up 10-15% on the month. If people bought the top of these stocks and hadn't been DCAing in its part of the risk.; I can't help but laugh at all the people here who always speak as though they have a firm grip on the market and their strategy is the way to go. We're all speculating. Some better than others so to get on your podium and ho-hum other people is petty and stupid.; You’re 100% right but prepare to be downvoted since it seems like more posters here are meme bagholders than ever before.; ""Nothing sedates rationality like large doses of effortless money. After a heady experience of that kind, normally sensible people drift into behavior akin to that of Cinderella at the ball. They know that overstaying the festivities — that is, continuing to speculate in companies that have gigantic valuations relative to the cash they are likely to generate in the future — will eventually bring on pumpkins and mice. But they nevertheless hate to miss a single minute of what is one helluva party. Therefore, the giddy participants all plan to leave just seconds before midnight. There’s a problem, though: They are dancing in a room in which the clocks have no hands.""

\- Warren Buffett; Yes, RKLB, a company that literally sends rockets into space is a ""shitco"" compared to the equities that you own: *checks notes* A company that sells weed.

This dude's brilliance is off the charts, everyone!; We are here to make money, memestocks, undervalued stocks, overvalued stocks, bankrupt stocks, it just doesn't matter.  Rklb, for me, is still at 300% gains. Thats all what matters.; I'm a long term RKLB holder. 

I think we will benefit from DOGE's suggestions to privatize space contracts more. 

Jeff Bezos wouldn't build a rocket company if there wasn't profit to be made. 

Give it some time, by 2030 I think we will see a share price of $75.; it's still going up lmao. jealous much? Why do you care so much about  what other people decide to do with their money?; Is one week before christmas ”early”?; I thought max pain was 370; no!; I fail to see how a weighted average of 500 stocks can have support and resistance levels if the 500 underlying stocks also have ther own support and resistance levels.; The only way to stabilize is buy back program; I'm not selling. And I know in the long term the shift will insignificant. But in the short term to see it; Could it have? I doubt it. This market will never actually go down.; Agree huge disruption gonna come to autos. If you aren't autonomous you're done. Google gonna be just fine.; [deleted]; Sure, then add on winter heating costs, kitchen/ laundry appliances, then suddenly having an electricity bill 5-10 times higher than the usual adds up. It's not literally just $5 (or rather $15 for 3 people) more per day per family! 
And that shower figure is like 20-50 cents using normal electricity prices.

Voters will riot over eggs going from $2 to $5, as we've seen recently.; Oopsie; Yea why couldn't he just keep his trap shut; Yeah… I was gonna close it out on Wednesday and take a loss. Then decided to hold and was just going to close it out regardless today. Dumb luck that I waited long enough for this huge increase. Position was at $9.42 so I didn’t make huge profit. Just don’t want to be on this ride anymore haha; Pre market it dropped to $74.17; I've done well with LPLA. Still planning on holding them.; I imagine this dude wakes up every day, checks his puts, paces back and forth in his 1 bedroom apartment, and smashes his pre-paid Boost mobile phone against the wall after typing these comments.; There is one. It's called VVIX

https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/whats-vvix-and-why-does-it-matter; Hey man this sub was rejoicing for trump lol; What makes the most sense is for cryptocurrencies to be outlawed.

Why are bearer bonds illegal but bitcoin isn't?; yea I have a pet rock, and it's worth $10,000,000 gonna call it Scamrock and paint it green.

Wanna buy it?; That’s how see it. I was able to scoop some up at 84. Figured once the actual market opens and volumes locks up, hoping people buy. 

Worst case, I caught a falling knife and I’m holding the shares longer than I’d like. ; The other issue becomes adverse effects. 22.5% vs 25% expected leads to a selloff, but if it has worse AE than something that's say 18-20%, the 18-20% that's much more tolerable is ultimately more compelling imo. 

Why did only 57% of patients get to the highest dose vs 70% with semaglutide? I think this NVO selloff is overdone, but imo it does look like VKTX - which has had a difficult year ended by a bad month w/smaller biotechs selling off - has the better drug.; Yes it does; I don’t understand what you mean? And I don’t think you know what you mean. 

This has already gone through, and it’s just them buying some patent designs of chillers they like.; I doubt it.  We're going into the cyclically weak time of year for tech.  If you can get 620 from it before February I'd consider selling but if you're long term, hey, just hang on.; They’ve already started moving away from China manufacturing.; Where is this report? I bought at the peak and am down bad; That’s what I’m thinking. The immediate future is so up in the air right now. I think I’m going to DCA monthly next year.; I do DCA for peace of mind lol but I'm on a budget and wouldn't make sense for me to unload all 7k; Didn't work well for EVVTY...; I held PLTR, have always hated Musk and told my self I would never buy TSLA. But there’s infinite potential for govt contracts over the next 4 years, they practically have the world’s largest money printer at their disposal.; you mean \*when you understand the stock market is vehicle institutions used to pump up stocks to make money regardless of the fundementals; Long term its almost impossible to keep this valuation. It trades at 500x operating income, which is just bonkers. But still, this madness can continue indefinitely.; yep , they have a continuing resolution ready for the worse case scenario, means they want to celebrate xmas with their families.; They presented their product to us with a use case that was essentially a chat GPT wrapper. I’m not sure what their value proposition was that couldn’t be replicated in house or by something much cheaper.; I tried to give explanation in the comment. Instead of repeating the same bear cases that gets mentioned about valuation. Institutions control the stock. They dont care about valuation. One part probably wants to be able to say to clients look I was in PLTR the stock that went up 350% YTD.

Maybe it me but do you ever get bored saying insane valuation day after day?; I have concluded that the Powers-That-Be know something about Palantir that we don't.

Or it's valuation is just nuts.; Thanks; how do you buy into American companies when the government takes 65% in taxes?; Lower wages though to be fair and higher taxation.; Lmao; In theory, you should be. On fidelity, you just need to turn on it. Trading pre-market or post market isn't anything that retail can't do. Just most brokers have it off by default, since volume is low and ask/bid spreads can be really wide.; Thanks! I never invested in DRS, but I have been in CW for a bit. I'll take a look :)

I've noticed that some other names like FTAI, LOAR, and WWD have all taken a 10-20% dip in the last few weeks. Going to add them to my watchlist.

I bought a HEI call to see what happens.; 
It’s down 10% in a week on nothing.  What’s crazy is we’re now in an investing world where a bad lunch at a tacky Florida golf club can affect a stock more than any amount of fundamentals.

Meanwhile oddball coins and anything with the word quant-m on their website is up by multiples.; It's a company people hate.

Personally, I loathe Zuckerberg and META.; are you even old enough to have a brokerage account?; No one could possibly make money shorting this thing unless you perfectly time the 2-3 hours where it's allowed to go down. Especially puts. The thing is guaranteed to lose at least 30-40% of its value the next day since no down move can sustain.; ionq, lunr, etc.; Depend if u got Nike, mu or smci..; I wanted to write Google, but that'd be very preposterous, to make Google all about Waymo.; 20K risk for $400 lmao

Don’t know how people do it; Had you buy in december you would be 8k on the stock. Timing the market helps the time in the market; That works as well. Thank you !; Maybe? 

Could easily just sign with Jake Paul or like MrBeast and I'm sure GenZ will eat it right up. They are still consumers.; I just like to laugh at regards speculating and then losing money. RKLB has solid fundamentals but the fair value is closer to 10 than 25 lol; Losing money on shitcos and crypto is deserved. Therefore I laugh; That makes it even funnier to me. P/Es are useless until they’re not lol; I don’t care what industry the company is in, be it space or weed. For instance, the company that sells weed has a higher revenue than RKLB whilst being valued at 5% and being profitable. 

Nobody cares about the industry, but about the cashflow that the security underneath it generates. So yes, one share in the weed retailer entitles me to 20x the free cash flow of 1 RKLB share. I’m so stupid right; Well how do you justify 35 P/S without profitability and risks still looming? I shouldn’t have used Shitco but overvalued. SpaceX is valued at 20 P/S whilst being profitable, having better technology and also having functional Starlink. One neutron going kaboom on the first flights and the price is in the gutter. You can’t rationally justify this high of a valuation without speculation; Yes, the “Santa rally” refers to specific trading days and it begins on the 24th.; You got me. I didn't actually determine what max pain was at, I just figured it might be at 420 because funny number; 503 stocks yo..; I just think it's one of those like the iPhone. I'm a bit older than most probably here, like mid 30s, and it does feel like something out of the future. 

Really feels like society still hasn't realized we have self driving cars.; Maybe? 

I made this comment around Waymo like 6 months ago. 

They’ve beeb in operation in Phoenix and SF for like years. Seems like the market is only know catching up to it. 

The 30% off the high is from like an October I believe. So the market didn’t price anything from waymo until the last few months. To me, that would make Waymo underrated, since the news of them moving into one Market, Miami, was enough to take the stock down 30%.; Trying to claim average living standards of Norway are worse than here is a lost cause but go right ahead; First dead cat bounce ?; Yep,

Bit of a pullback in financials the last week, buying more here.  Citi is undervalued right now more than most, IMO.  

Very bullish on banks, visa, MC, AMEX etc.  Profit will go into tech in late February/ early march but hey, market conditions will dictate that not time frames where things change easily.  

I remain bullish in the cycles that are happening.; That's a vivid image, thank you.; Thanks. Learnt smth today 🥳 so, we are in a transition stage, seems like. From rough waters to a calm ocean. 


That's why my options basically are flat even when underlying moved 3-4%. Normally, they'd jump at least 20-30% (they're far out).; Sounds like CDOs, is BTC the new CDO? Do you take cards? I’ll take 500 on 20 to 1 margin; Good Luck, when I look at them I just felt like their pipeline was not as strong as other players.  I would expect some small recovery.; I do wonder at the end of the day, will the consumer actually care who has the best drug? 

If ballpark is roughly the same, I’d imagine the consumer will care most about price and availability of the drug. 

Plus those who work with insurance. I’d imagine in the near future, insurance companies will want to cover these drugs, due to the fact that obesity is terrible for long term health. 

If treated like preventative care, it will actually save insurance/ consumers money in the long run. Heart disease is still the number one killer in the US. ; Oh I am long term lol.

Bought one lot in 2016, a smaller lot in 2018.

Capital gains would be murder.; Look up Grizzly Research. 11/21/2024; now I dunno lol. this market; [deleted]; at least they handled it somewhat better than AMR, who bought back to the sky whilst management cashed out stock options last january. Half the price now, no cash for buybacks left..

EVO sort of timed the market, probably not expecting further price derioration after last fairly good earnings. In hindsight, they should not deplete buyback authorization completely although the occured value loss is minimal still. US and regulated market margins is where risk is for EVO.; The problem is musk has never demonstrated he's willing to do anything politically for tesla. He's not defending the ev rebates, he's not going after the oil companies. It seems the maga got to him, not the other way around. And that's bad for tesla.; Trump does not control Congress, and based on the budget debacle currently going, not all R's will fall in line with Trump, so Trump will have a hard time passing his agenda. There's only so much corruption the executive branch can do for Tesla.; Correct, psychological, not fundamental; I can’t even conceive of the kind of person that is buying Palantir at these levels.; They can not shut the government down 5 days before Christmas.; Never used their software, but seems like all these companies are basically the same thing. More or less they have their own ETL's that move data into a data warehouse. From there, I'm assuming that PLTR must have their own models. 

I do think a lot of this can be accomplished in house, however, the ETL aspect is a pain. Depending on how much data and the type of db structure you have, trying to migrate data can be really annoying.; I think it’s a Elon Musk effect being applied to Peter Thiel. Some assumption that the election result will help his businesses in some unspecified way.

That and a rabid cult of people that invest in the stock.; European taxes are much higher; Its more the issue that my ass cant get up that early on the west coast >.<; People hate Meta

They use it, and they hate it.

They go onto Meta's apps and scream about how much they hate it 

They bitch and complain about Meta stealing their data in Europe and then use VPNs in Europe so they can use their new smart glasses pretending that they live anywhere else.

If Apple were to buy Meta, they would praise Apple for their invention of social media 

Everybody hates VR until Apple makes a headset and then charges what you could get for a kindey on the black market for it, and it flops, but now VR is dead.

Sick of this shit.; That's ok

I yearn for the days someone makes a slightly better god damn smartphone than that that rotten fruit company that can do no wrong and people remember that they hate electric vehicles.; Why?

3.06 billion monthly users.

That is just under 40% of the world's population.

Everybody hates Meta?

Oh, they will be punished if they can't get that number to 3.07%

It's the oh FB is dead people, when all they consider is the United States.

It's the oh, I hate Congress, but my congressman is doing a bang-up job mentality. 

It's complaining about Meta WHILE on Meta.

It's users in Europe bitching about their privacy while simultaneously using a VPN so that they can use Meta AI on glasses Meta told them wouldn't work in their utopian countries.

An then bitch when Meta closes the loophole and users complain and again Bitch about Meta, while all Meta is trying to do is avoid getting shaken down by those frikin Europeans.

There is only so many ways to ""social media"" and Meta has the market cornered and people can't stand being dependent on Mark Zuckerberg.

It's an irrational dislike, and I just can't figure out why.

People criticize Meta for just copying everyone else when a big chunk of Apple's revenue is taking 30% from app developers for exactly no work. 

Apple is a parasite and holds some sort of cult like following while Zuckerberg is demonized. 

He should have changed his companies name to peach or lime, and then maybe people wouldn't hate him.; >To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development.

People in their 30s can reference dick joke memes, man.; I agree I don't short indices. Are you sitting on cash? You seem a bit annoyed by the permanently rising indices a bull wouldn't mind it.; Stop losses; Don’t tell that to the regards here; There are a LOT of shitcos but RKLB isn’t one of them.; You should see all the recent Seeking Alpha articles pumping these stocks. Totally absurd.; So right!; The price is high yes but I don't believe its unreasonable.

I wouldn't buy more currently unless it hit under $20.

SpaceX is around 350 billion

RKLB is at 11.7 billion, putting it at less than 4% of SpaceX's marketcap.

That being said, it has a -70 P/E Ratio. 

This is a slow moving industry with huge potential and I'm in it for the long term. RKLB is one of my more speculative investments.; Shit I always thought it was up to christmas.; Same difference; Not enough people live in areas w robotaxis. One ride in that and people would open their eyes.; I agree in principle with safety etc but these elephant in the room is the cost, with the state of the art uber reliable chips and other components that are needed to facilitate these cars, doesn’t it put these cars out of budget for most Americans and certainly most ppl outside of America? 

You have to have some advertisement pitch that says how it will save you money over the years to convince you to buy. Safety is not enough. 
You aren’t saving any time either buying autonomous vehicles, even if you were, it wouldn’t financially make sense to buy a costlier vehicle to me.

I am taking abt relative profits from these cars to Google in relation to the money they already make since you mentioned you like GOOG for waymo.; Two things, and then I have nothing else to add:

1. Never said living standards are worse in Norway. I'm literally just saying energy costs in Europe are frequently spiking to abnormal levels in winters, to levels higher than most places in the world, including other relatively rich countries. This has bad implications for future industrial growth and economic growth. That's all. This isn't a 'US versus Norway' argument.
2. I didn't even say Norway anywhere in my comments above (the anecdote was Sweden). The hourly wage in Sweden is about 36% lower than it is in Norway [(source)](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/average-wages-across-europe-map/). And these power spikes are everywhere, Germany, Sweden, France, UK, Spain. Not just the richest Nordic country you can find.; Barrons streetwise last podcast had one of their analyst do like their 10 picks for the year. Citi was one of them. 

I don't really do banks, but I have a family member that whole sales annuities and that's how I even know about LPLA, just being the biggest independent broker service. 

Overall, been really happy owning them. Plus they aren't the worst in terms of valuation.; Ty!

This is a trade and hopefully not an investment, ie I caught the falling knife lol. ; Yes, price and availability are primary considerations, but I'll still say adverse effects (especially along the lines of PFE's failure with their trial a year ago that they chose not to advance to phase 3 - discontinuation rates above 50% does not help) vs peer offerings absolutely is a very meaningful part of the equation.

There's been this view that ""why doesn't everyone just pop out a GLP-1 drug?""  for the last two years as this theme has gone on and yet, LLY still remains with a substantial lead. NVO's stock is going to open about 40-45ish% off the high, the PFE trial results were poor, AMGN's offering doesn't seem encouraging, maybe ZEAL has something but that's -16%. IMHO the specifics matter and it's not just ""who has the biggest % loss."" 

One key cloud over VKTX is production, but when you have a top drug in the class with excellent tolerability that can at least potentially be worked out. If it was just ""who can knock a lot of a drug out and maybe the side effects are like that vomit scene from Family Guy but people lose a good deal of weight and it's cheaper"" then the market would currently have more options at this point and yet it's still almost entirely LLY/NVO two+ years into this theme and the latter is starting to look like it's falling behind a little.

I mean, I had dozens of arguments last year with people who kept trying to make the case for PFE over LLY/NVO because ""they're cheap and they have an obesity drug, too!""

Edit: Citi: ""This is nearly a best case scenario for LLY..."" (https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GfPopmZXMAAUMe2?format=png&name=900x900)

Citi also noting what I said: ""...as discussed in our note, **tolerability is paramount to doctors and patients.**""; Oh never heard of them. Solid report though; Buying European equals losing wealth straight up; Oh, I agree EVO is doing well buying at these prices. Long term, if they keep it up they can really slash their share count on the cheap. 

So far it hasn't helped though.; Lol, why not?; I’m not sure layering on a proprietary software into the process really makes things all that simpler. It certainly makes things much more inflexible. ; THought I had read that the average was something like 65%. That was awhile ago.

All that free stuff they get, sure does cost someone a lot.; You can do GTC limit orders and leave them open for extended hours. So you dont have to be on the app/brokerage for the order to execute.; Hahah totally. I'm also west coast, but I'm naturally up like 5AM every day. Kind of cool, kind of sucks lol. 

There's like one other time that I've done something like that, which was like a few quarters ago when DDOG dropped off an ok report in the pre-market. I did it this morning with NVO, hoping I didn't catch a failing knife.; I hate meta and don’t use it.  I invest since it’s slightly less toxic than tobacco.  As for VR, meta’s cheap and well liked product is one of the reasons I’ve been long.  However I wanted to crystallize the recent gains and be out of the blast radius when the corrupt TikTok thing happens, assuming I’d buy it back after that.

Now I’m probably stuck and when the TikTok bribery thing does happen, the stock will get hit again.; I had sell orders on all social media like META and SNAP and others at the start of the week since I’m sure the crime family boss will do a corrupt deal with TikTok.  I’m bitter the META ones just missed executing.  Maybe someone knows something and they front ran it here.; MSNBC keeps claiming no one uses Facebook or that weird ignoble site any longer so I understand why some people think that. ; Zuckerberg is a psychopath who has intentionally amplified the worst trends of modern society so that he can profit. 

That is why people hate him and his companies, and it is anything but irrational.; Shouldn’t have used shitco but overvalued to the tits. 30+ P/S is a joke; They have to learn somehow. Ionq to 100 right?; The comparison to SpaceX is irrelevant, SpaceX is miles ahead and you should value company by the financials and cashflow that they’re producing. You’ve got a company that’s more expensive than SpaceX (75% premium to SpaceX actually) that is inferior with all the technology and that is unprofitable. One flop and the death spiral can commence, with SpaceX it’s far less likely; this is the pre santa rally; I'm looking at these vehicles as more of a pure robotaxi vs something a consumer would want to purchase. 

No idea if it will be something that the consumer even wants 100%. There will always be people who prefer driving. Just like there is still markets for VHS and even records, before they become popular.; Banks are ok in an easing cycle and with Trumps easing of banking rules.  It's a no brainer for now but I would NEVER long banks in the USA.  They underperform.  

This is a good once in five year run up and its going to be a nice ride.  Unless we get a recession of course.  

This is how to trade bank stocks and cyclically this is the way to play it.; Because as laughable as our government has become from geriatric presidents, sex offender attorney generals, and word salad interviews a government shit down right before the biggest holiday of the year would be the most rancid diseased cherry on top ever.; Cause I said so!

It's very scientific.; Just depends.

ETL's aren't crazy, but we had to build our own due to cost. The way we structure our data, it wasn't scalable to use a different solution, due to cost. However, the trade off is that we can't migrate all the data and it there is still engineering cost in order to maintain.

70,Why I’m Short Apple (AAPL) March 225 Puts – The Bubble is About to Burst,"TL;DR: Apple (AAPL) has surged irrationally, rising over $25 in December without any clear catalyst. Meanwhile, the cracks in the armor are forming—AI isn’t saving them, potential trade issues will pressure margins, and their premium valuation is unsustainable heading into Q1 2025. I’m betting the downside is unavoidable.

1. The AI Supercycle is a Mirage
Despite market hype, Apple has no meaningful AI differentiation. Unlike NVIDIA or Microsoft, Apple isn’t seen as a dominant AI player—its products rely heavily on services and premium hardware that have limited ties to AI advancement. This means no “AI tailwinds” to buoy the stock. While Apple has released some iterative software updates tied to AI (think Siri enhancements or computational photography), they’re nowhere near monetizing this tech the way other companies have. Investors are waking up to this reality.

2. Trade Headwinds and Shrinking Margins
Apple’s dependency on international manufacturing is a double-edged sword. Potential trade barriers or geopolitical uncertainties could result in increased costs, impacting its gross margins. While Apple is exploring options to diversify its manufacturing footprint (e.g., India or Vietnam), these shifts aren’t immediate solutions and are notoriously expensive. This margin compression story isn’t reflected in its current valuation.

3. Q1 2025 Will Disappoint
The first quarter is traditionally one of Apple’s strongest due to holiday sales, but cracks are forming:
	•	Demand issues in China: Geopolitical tensions and economic headwinds mean weaker Chinese demand.
	•	Premium Pricing Fatigue: Consumers are scaling back on non-essential upgrades. The iPhone 15 isn’t converting older iPhone users as fast, and other product lines (MacBooks, iPads) are not seeing the kind of innovation needed to boost sales.
	•	Services Saturation: Apple’s growth engine, services (App Store, iCloud), is nearing peak user growth, and regulatory scrutiny could start pinching service margins.

4. Valuation Has Gone Too Far
Apple is trading at 30x earnings, far above historical averages, for what is fundamentally a hardware company with diminishing innovation. By comparison, during its 2016 stagnation phase, Apple traded near 12-15x. A “soft landing” for tech multiples will hit Apple harder because its growth story is exaggerated compared to actual fundamentals.

5. The December Surge Is Speculative Froth
Apple’s meteoric $25 rise in December is unfounded. There hasn’t been a game-changing product announcement, a blowout earnings release, or AI breakthrough to justify the move. The rally is more likely driven by institutions trying to mark up their portfolios for year-end performance. When the rebalancing happens in January, Apple will be the first to feel the heat.

Why Short March 225 Puts?
AAPL closed near $250 recently. My short strike at $225 gives some cushion for temporary noise, while still capturing a high premium as investors scramble to secure overvalued positions. I’m betting that as Q1 progresses, analysts will cut estimates, trade challenges will hit margins, and reality will set in. I see AAPL revisiting the $200-$210 range in early 2025.

This is not financial advice, but it is a warning: Apple’s future isn’t as bright as Wall Street thinks. Evaluate your risk, but don’t ignore this tech bubble.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1high4l/why_im_short_apple_aapl_march_225_puts_the_bubble/,79,2024-12-20 10:51:18,"

kindly reminder.; Good luck, Apple literally has so much FCF they do $90 billion in buy backs every year.

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640); Aren’t there 1000s of other unprofitable companies to short? Why apple out of all of them?; you are right but you will lose money ![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787); Oh boy wait until you hear about Tesla.; I agree with you short term however betting against Apple long term is risky.. Apple is the master of not being first to a new technology but somehow managing to still steal the show in the end. I wouldn't be surprised if they find a way to do this with AI too.; Never bet against Apple. You’re betting against monthly automated inflows from all kinds of ETFs, pension funds, 401Ks, mutual funds. So many other junk to go short on and you pick the darling of wall street that’s been infallible for decades.; Wrecked; Good write up, but post your positions; I thrust Tim Apple to keep the stonk bullish. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883); I hold their stock forever and buy calls after a dip. This is one of those stocks that likes to go up.; Loss porn please. ; short... puts?

methinks OP is somewhat not understanding; You assume that Apple will lose customer base because they can't compete in the form of AI? Last I checked, people bought Apple products for reliability. It was never about being first or being the most innovative. It's the same argument over and over for decades now. Even if their stock price comes down a bit, their cashflow remains strong as ever with marginal increases.; Anyone else ready for GUH 2.0?; Betting against $AAPL, huh ballsy, stupid but ballsy; It's apple. Goodluck. I'm up 100% in 4 years. It's fort Knox; I've been saying this for a while now. Clear reasons to upgrade in the past used to be performance and battery life for both phones and laptops. Now that both are more then fine people opt to rather replace the battery then buy a new device. You see this happening everywhere. The tech simply isn't that revolutionary anymore. They try and upsell you fancy new AI stuff and fancy cameras now but AI can be accessed through a browser just fine and if you're not a photographer, you don't need such a fancy camera. 

Mark my words, all phone and soon laptop companies will start to take a massive hit. Qualcomm and their fancy new snapdragon cpu made sure of that.when will it start? Well, my guess is somewhere around March the real bleed will start. Why? God damn global unrest and how much more expensive shit is going to get.

Edit: and don't give me any of that 'but apple is an ecosystem' bs. It will be an easy choice if you have to decide between food and a phone where you just use it to watch YouTube and browse reddit on.; Get a load of this guy. He's *shorting Apple*; higher risk, higher prize. well.... another one bites the dust; Have fun with that. Wendy’s needs Christmas help.; this will lose you money!; None of the AI stuff, while very impressive, will generate revenue. All these chips in datacenters are consuming energy. 

You need products to sell. The feature phone craziness is long gone. That in my opinion means Apple cannot maintain its product pricing. 

It has invested a lot in its chips. They are impressive. But the margins are not maintainable. 

If and when the stock market reacts accordingly is another story. But I agree Apple is due for a massive downturn.; I hope you're right and you profit but what keeps me from doing the same is people are fanatical over their products, innovation or not. People in poor countries will still buy their devices even in rough times.; You forgot to add people are getting tired of buying the same phone every year; welp, AAPL calls indeed; The catalyst was them announcing a dividend; This play is a no. Apple’s customer base buys new products even with small incremental improvements and will spend thousands of dollars for it.; Good write up, Apple can be a hard short (shareholders are stingy).  
But i think this will hit.; Will china cool on apple? That's what i worry about.; I’ve been reading “the bubbles about to burst” for the past year; Why is everything a bubble ? Why can’t it be a pullback here is an apple chart as a reminder this is the years when apple pops people the bubble is here blah blah blah. A guy that works Wendy’s is calling the bubble

Apple colab with airports for find your phone was pretty cool. Their phones are hitting a wall though progress has slowed significantly.

I wonder if they'll ever release an iPhone Fold.; Post your positions or ban; Apple is clearly overvalued but AI hype keeps the train going.; Two hundred billion in share buybacks; Apple puts are my hedge against other disaster as well. If it drops to trading near 12-15x earnings again in the next 6-9 months I'd make $2-3M lmfao.; Almost every school nationwide is locked in on buying iPads or MacBooks - makes you wonder who's making money on from it all. Of course, if the DoEd goes bye bye, that could all change...; AI on iPhone is big nothing burger; Bro, Apple is the Magnus Carlsen of companies. He will turn any situation with even the slightest advantage to a win and scoop up the full point.; Yes getting bad, as they sell 255 million IPhones for 1,500$ each; Bears 🐻 I know you guys had your one day of fun last week with that big dip, but I think it might have made you a little delulu basing on this post; Blue horseshoe loves AAPL; Goodluck.; 1% profit for 3 months?
Short put is a neutral / bullish position.
You sure it’s smart?; “Short puts”? Uk being short on a put is bullish right?; Shorting Apple requires ball of dark matter when there is so much overvalued stuff on the market.; I see big money rebalancing into Apple in January; Yo if buffet is cutting his stake, then he might know something. The top is in.; You surely made a fortune on this; Homie there's a graveyard filled with AAPL bears who thought Apple's days were done after Steve Job's death. The moment Zoomers think iPhone are ghetto and stop buying them is the day i dump all my shares.; do not bet against the king himself; Apple is definitely way overpriced.; $AAPL PE ratio is at a peak, a level not seen since early 2021.

Warren Buffett unloaded 2/3 of his Apple stock this year. Now he is sitting on an all-time-high level of cash.

The Wednesday crash did not hit $AAPL nearly as hard as the other big tech stocks. More room to go down than other stocks IMO.; [deleted]; Idk man.. Apple announced back in June the integration of Chat GPT and have now implemented Chat GPT on their Iphones 2 days ago + MAC OS.. So not sure why you think there has not been any catalyst for their increase in stock price. Seems pretty obvious with just one google search.; Justify your position all you want, just realize it is completely wrong and you will lose
Money.  The holidays are the best time of year for Apple.  Just because the iPhone 16 didn’t sell well out the gate….probably means that people are getting it for themselves or someone else for the holidays.  Apple will print money hand over fist again this holiday….and the next year….and the next….; Only an idiot shorts apple lol every dip gets bought. Pick another stock; I'm constantly thinking about this: Shouldn't apple develop a server, which will be crazy efficient thanks to Apple Silicon, to replace some Linux servers. It's all Unix, so most things exist for Mac as well. That would open a new world to them.; Can I get the too long/can’t read on this? ⬆️; Fcf?; Buying back shares at the top isn't a great use of cash; Short the strongest.

What I'd like to point out is apple just bounced off of it's high again today... that type of thing doesn't happen over and over again.

You're hearing it here first, bloody monday. If I'm wrong you can take trunks flicking my balls.

Also dow happened to go up more today than the nasdaq, first time that's happened in ages.; Imagine his surprise when he goes short on some put options, Apple skyrockets, and he goes to the eye doctor to find out why red shows up as green in his eyeballs.; The last part is so true. 
The new devices are so expensive but the only things you really need are:
- Mail
- YouTube, Netflix, whatever you stream 
- A fast Webbrowser to access most social media 
- Some games to kill time
- Make photos for social media 
- All devices have Instagram, Twitter, whatever 

You can do that on 99% of all available phones and tablets.; Ah yes, gonna have to choose between fOoD and an iPhone 16 pro max. How much do you think basic groceries are/will be, regard?

Agree with your larger point about discretionary spend but anytime someone in this sub mentions “food is too expensive” (in the US), I just want to roll my eyes; Don't underestimate Apple brand loyalty. I bet there are people, who will cut corners in other parts of their lives (food, shelter) just to remain in that ecosystem (for the social ""status"" or whatever the fcuk they're getting out of it).; 🥱; I don’t think so.

Tesla, and AMD are also developing AI chips. Right now, tech companies are only buying Nvidia's chips to get started and build market share, because they do not want to fall behind their competition. 

Using Nvidia's chips at current prices is not profitable, even successful AI companies such as OpenAI fail to achieve positive operating margins despite a highly popular product with paid features. Large tech companies are reluctantly buying Nvidia's hardware to avoid falling behind their competition in market share. But relying on Nvidia long term is never the intention, these companies need to be profitable eventually, Nvidia is just there to get them started.

The thing is, Nvidia's 74.56% gross margin is a strength, but its also a vulnerability. It demonstrates that any AI company that can cut out Nvidia can significantly reduce their costs, and that's why everyone is building their own chips. They don't need to be faster than Nvidia to succeed, they just need to be fast enough to provide services at a lower cost, which is quite a low bar. Developing new products takes time, which is why Nvidia's windfall has lasted. But give it 1-3 more years and you'll start to see the impact on Nvidia's sales.

With everyone rushing to develop their own chips, and all of them relying on TSMC, TSMC has the true windfall. They will certainly be able to hike their prices on wafers due to increased demand, which will hurt Nvidia's margins.

This will be their downfall. They are not hedging their reliance on TSMC by seeking to acquire or develop their own fab business, they are not increasing R&D sufficiently to stay ahead of their competition.

TSMC is definitely a safe bet but a simple comparison between Nvidia and 2017 Intel’s capex will show you how utterly regarded this post is.; Chyna has been threatening to invade taiwan in the past 70 years. This is worse than the broken clock. ; Wait you’re that guy everyone flames in r/aoe4 💀💀; Microsoft tried to make phones how did that go ? How did the fire phone go ? Remember Google + ? 
You think one day you decide you want to be a pilot and then the next day you are one ? If they could make chips they would but they can’t; This dude has never used a computer; No; As long as Nvidia isn’t turning around in 7 years time to unveil their 5nm++++ process while literally paying people not to buy AMD cards, I can’t see them following the same trajectory 

For one, Jensen doesn’t even have to pay anyone not to buy AMD, he just rings up his cousin and tells her anything above 2gb gddr in the memory modules on her cards and she’s not invited to Christmas dinner.; I aint gonna read allat but you're fucking wrong OP thats all I can say; You're viewing the business relationship with TSMC as one-sided, but that's not the case. TSMC’s reliance on Nvidia as a major client means its pricing power may be more constrained. Outsourcing manufacturing isn’t a weakness. Apple doesn’t build its phones in-house, yet it remains one of the most dominant companies in the world.; -10.00% for the month.; I've been bearish the past 6 months, this post isn't anything new; Absolute mouth breather ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) OP, do you even have any puts or just foaming around?; Did I imply that they own the design? Without TSMC, Nvidia has no product because they do not own their own fab. And TSMC has lots of customers that will be lining up, willing to pay high prices to develop their own designs that compete with Nvidia. So Nvidia's margins are at the mercy of TSMC.; Give it 5 years and you will see.; >The Intel comparison? Nah fam. Intel got clapped because they couldn't figure out their manufacturing game. Meanwhile NVDA's playing 4D chess with their software ecosystem. CUDA got everyone by the balls.

Their entire business is dependent on a single company in Taiwan because Nvidia has no Fab at all. If TSMC doubles their prices, what are they going to do? Go to Intel? Samsung? Both of those have an inferior process. TSMC has all the power.

> Your OpenAI example's straight copium. They're losing money cause they're burning cash on compute to stay ahead, not cause of GPU costs. That's like saying Ferrari's gonna fail cause gas is expensive.

Compute is literally their operating costs. Without compute they have no product. What OpenAI is doing is like the equivalent of if I started an electricity company that charges $0.10 per kilowatt hour to customers, but pays a power plant $0.40 per kilowatt hour to produce it. It's not sustainable, but I base my business on hoping that eventually I can make my own power plant that produces electricity at $0.05 per kilowatt hour, and leverage existing market share to profit in the future.

>The real shit? Everyone and their mom trying to make AI chips just proves how massive this market is. More players = bigger pie.

They would not be developing their own chips if they did not think they had a chance at being a substitute for Nvidia's product. They do not need to produce a superior product to succeed, they just need to produce it at a lower cost than Nvidia's insane markup to avoid Nvidia's price gouging.; dyinggg; Holy shit. It's Chad Dickens.

I think Intel will be sold and parts of their business bought out by various companies and the Fab business separated from the chip side of things. Leaving AMD as the go to company for microchips as they are miles ahead.

Look at your work or home computer, would it be able to run a next gen AI app or AI software in the next year or so?

There has been some concern this week with Micron and the PC business but i think the market is overlooking the fact that there is a massive upgrade cycle coming for AI personal computers. Think about all the outdated PC's that are currently out there. That's thousands of companies and corporations, Universities/colleges/schools, data centers and personal home computers that are not optimized for AI and the AI apps that will come down the pipeline next year. The addressable market is massive, this isn't limited to the US but think Europe, Asia, South America all looking to have an AI enabled PC in their office or home. You cant have the AI software development without having AI enabled PC's. Apple discovered this with their AI phones. You need upgrades on CPU's, Upgraded GPU's, Upgraded RAM and hard drives/storage.

Next lets talk about custom chip designs. The market went wild when Broadcom brought this up. No one realizes that AMD has been working on this for a while. They also make AI accelerators that directly compete with everyone else in performance. Their website has a list of their products this isnt something new they are jumping into.

>To the victor go the spoils and AMD beat Intel, so now its time to reap the rewards of being the biggest in their space.

The stock price has little to do with AMD's competitive position regarding Intel; you need to be thinking about whether AMD can gain share against Nvidia.

As it happens, AMD isn't beating Intel. For all Intel's struggles and AMD's successes, x86 market share is 3:1 in favor of Intel.

>i think the market is overlooking the fact that there is a massive upgrade cycle coming for AI personal computers. Think about all the outdated PC's that are currently out there.   
...  
You cant have the AI software development without having AI enabled PC's.

Many companies have been trying to sell that they can offer fast local inference, including AMD, but I don't see any actual demand for such services.

Most of the world is betting that AI is not really a PC thing. Microsoft is trying to make it a thing, but the investment dollars are going into the data center. The most likely future is like [chatgpt.com](http://chatgpt.com), which you can access via any device. No need for any number of TOPS on your local PC, or even a local PC.; AMD beat Intel, unfortunately for them they can't even compete well with Nvidia and the CPU duopoly they have enjoyed for years is at risk.

Their moat is shrinking.; I'm long AMD, bought in 2022 and up >50% currently. I do agree the stock was too high, if it dips to near $100 I will increase my position.

I am holding AMD, NVDA and AVGO.  Bottom line everything needs a semi chip nowadays so exposure to semis is needed.

So for sure AMD is in good hands.; Nvidia is king and already has plans to enter CPU market, If AI stumbles.

AMD has failed to execute on their AI strategy thus far.  They need to topple CUDA but dont have the SW engineers to do it.

NVDA is king.; I think you may have misspelled SMCI.; I've been traumatized by both AMD and SMCI. I could never buy either again.; Let me be *absolutely* clear here.


Ive worked repairing PCs for the longest time. The ""mindshare"" that people both young and old (mostly young) have that nvidia cards are THE BEST. Is mind boggling.


Very RARELY if EVER, do kids come in and ask for AMD cards. Always Nvidia.


NOW, regarding AI. AMD will not take advantage of the AI trend unless more open source work is done to make it as seamless a process as it is for nvidia users. And that trend will bubble up to more mainstream populous. That is a fact. Once you see news in the small communites that AMD cards have this new fangled open source program thats easy to install, sure, jump on and dump a few k to hold for a couple years.


Fin.; Maybe but I’m sad; We have one of these weekly now. We started at $160 down to $130 and now $118. 

Biggest semi opportunity is Nvidia. Based on analyst expectations they’re poised to double again in the next 2 years. 

AMD isn’t going to grow just because it had a bad year. It jumped 128% in 2023 despite not having much AI datacenter revenue. This year the stock has repriced since their AI revenue is still tiny next to Nvidia. Next year they’re expected to double again $10b in AI sales and 55% margin compared to $160b and 75% margin for Nvidia.

Buy AMD if you want but it would be a fraction of your Nvidia position.; I’m sure they can topple Apple backed Broadcom; I like MRVL.; Shhh don’t let people look at the balance sheet before I get another 100; No Intel is; > Guidance keeps going up. This stock is recession proof.

What's the PT Barnum saying again?; uh ARM much?; There is a huge difference in saying the ""The total addressable market is massive"" for AI and company X has a dominant product in the given TAM space.

Until AMD can develop something like that, they're just a good, but not great or exceptional company/stock.  

AI PC chip is just marketing fluff.  There will come a point where every PC CPU ""has AI baked into it"".  It's not going to expand the market for what has become a commodity product.

A lot of words with basically close to none in substance. At least the Intel post talked about innovations made that is pulling the company forward.; Meh, nah. Your post all depends on a big assumption about Intel, doesn't give any reasoning why that'll happen, and also doesn't take into account any of Intel's strategies. They just started making GPUs and already have  competitive products for price tier. In 1-2 years this could flip the script where Nvidia is coming to them to make their GPUs instead of TSMC. Intel also has several key technological advantages they are incorporating into next-gen CPUs coming 2025. They are in hot-water right now and seemingly at a make it or break it point, but I think it's too early to call it.; I’m not making that mistake again with AMD, I thought I bought it at a right time and it went down massively. A lot of bullish articles then. I waited, but did not came back up so I sold. Then literally 2wks later it went up a lot. I see the same pattern, now I just wait it out. If it’s not in the coming months, then we will see some returns in the coming years. Technology is the future of humans anyways and we always will need a computer, so lets see how AMD will behave next year!; Even at 90 usd per share more expensive then Nvidia, like wtf and they dont even have such dominant position, for me, Nvidia is a Winner and the share orice doesnt reflect that, Look Avgo or Tesla P/E pure hype madness; I get pleased when I'm red on AMD and I buy more every time I am.

Please buy the stock so I can at least come out even and invest in Nvidia.; I thought it was INTC trading below 19$ and AMD will soon drop to $105; I work in the semiconductor sector and I can tell you that it is a risky move to buy AMD right now. Just because an industry becomes popular and mainstream doesn't mean it is a profitable high margin business or makes the stakeholders rich. Look at Intel between 2000-2020. On paper, they should have been like Nvidia. Monopoly everywhere which was high margin and relegating ARM to the king of cheap chips (no pun intended). I can assure you that if we cannot monetize AI in 2025, VC money is going to get dry and all these AI startups are going to go out of business because they are not making money. It is going to be like the .com bubble, some AI companies will survive and in 10 years we will have amazing products (basically Microsoft and the other FANG companies). Actually, that is the most likely scenario, rather than automagically making AI truly useful in 2025. In this case, everyone will take a hit, Nvidia, Intel, AMD, Apple, Meta, yada yada.

It’s a cyclical stock I’ve noticed, I usually go as far as possible out and manage through there. Also a great PMCC stock if you manage correctly.; VIX is crazy high rn. Options premiums are pumping and AMD is no different; *Conceptually* AMD could be a great value because there is some unknown but large TAM growth ahead and they *could* become a solid \#2 supplier to NVDA in a big and rapidly growing market. If that *does* play out and AMD has industry normal margins then earnings growth is taking off and maybe they maintain a nice ~30 forward PE multiple as long as revenue keeps growing. Simple.


The hard part is how likely is that scenario? Cloud server CPU TAM could well be declining in the face of the robust competition and all vendors offering cost/core to drive down hardware price, and hyperscalers are prioritizing investment in GPU capacity. This was AMD's most dominant market and it's no longer sexy.


Client and gaming markets are going nowhere. Embedded is going to stay depressed until at least late 25 or 26.

The revenue is growing quarter over quarter which means they are still growing but they will NEVER see the explosive growth NVDA saw; It doesn't suck, it was just overpriced because everyone hoped it would take off like Nvidia any day now and that didn't happen. But it may grow substantially as it grows more sustainably in the years to come.; My cost basis is 38. Sold at 176. Ran over 200.... now on the way back down.

There is brand loyalty and social status in owning them. 

For products like GPU and CPUs, as soon as one brand's product straight up performs better, people will jump ship. I'm not saying AMD GPUs will beat NVidia in performance any time soon. But look at how quickly Intel dropped off as soon as x3D chips from AMD got crowned the king of gaming performance.; Last time I tried AMD gpu was 2018 when everyone was saying they were great again and had non stop driver issues in old games. Nvidia almost never has issues and you can see despite amd having only 20% of gpu market share they have as many issue threads on driver issues. Nvidia is worth the premium for peace of mind ; AMD aside, it's endearing to find someone sincerely believing ""analyst expectations"".; Intel could explode or implode on itself like a diaretic anus running in reverse.

We will be using intels new processors and will see how those go but they look okay on paper. Having two vendors is also ideal because it lets us source from two different supply chains which reduces risk. It’s not all just about performance there are several factors to consider. I work at a Fortune 500 cloud software company. 

If Intel can deliver at least close to AMD products they will do okay. Their brand recognition is not “dead” but it did make them miss a few upgrade cycles from a lot of companies. Not sure about guadi but we are looking at trying AMD GPUs next round.; AMD forward PE is only 22.; On what projected growth rates?

Maybe I’m mistaken but AMD has shown negative earnings growth while NVDA’s growth has been staggering.; 
This has already happened in the CPU space after INTC shit the bed on their current gen processors. AMD has become the new in demand gold standard CPU; >But look at how quickly Intel dropped off as soon as x3D chips from AMD got crowned the king of gaming performance.

X3D is great stuff technically, but it only has meaningful value for a tiny segment of gamers - the ones who build their own high end desktop. Most gamers buy laptops. Most gamers who buy desktops buy prebuilts. Go look at the Dell Alienware, Lenovo Legion, or HP Omen storefronts. I can't find a mention of X3D anywhere. Among gamers who build their own, most don't have a budget that justifies buying even a 7800X3D, let alone a 9800X3D.; Your affinity for reading the thesaurus is endearing; Dude think about what you just said. The stock was ripping to $200 on the ""hope"" that it will see explosive growth, which it did not and most likely will not see. Will it continue growing? Sure but that doesn't justify a $200 share price and it has deservedly been crushed this year unless they somehow ramp up growth more in their AI chips; AMD and the infinite dip; Just bought another 4k, great to hear; If you think a stock will grow based on debt and cash, I have bad news for you.; Bro, #sarcasm! Are we really thinking the post that I replied to, is not sarcastic?; Genuine question. At what point does it become more profitable to lock in losses for the sake of tax breaks?; I don't think tax loss harvesting applies to stock that you were granted and didn't have to purchase...; Grift trade is sadly accurate.; SBF made the crazy hair uncool; That interview put pltr on my radar.  The price was 30 something at the time of airing.. I was def considering buying but the company is also owned by peter thiel so I couldnt pull the trigger.  Its going to do great tho.; As a consumer when it comes to the gaming gpus, I personally regret buying NVDIA and will be looking at AMD as my next purchase.

NVIDIA got a lead due their shiny features (Ray-Tracing and DLSS) but in the end I found the jump from the 1080ti to the 3080 not to be as amazing as I expected.

At least from that perspective I do think AMD will continue to have room to gain their market share back.; AMD could triple with a 20% market share. What's NVDA gonna do in a couple years? 10T market cap? Why not 20T? 50T?


The time to hold #1 was a 5bagger ago, and I did, and I still do; Yes and NVDA is overvalued right now while AMD is undervalued. Source DCF model. So sure NVDA to the moon but AMD has way more catch up to do and that’s very valuable to the future earnings potential of a dollar invested. Competition is healthy and AMDs focus on accelerators and AI networking seems to be pointing to a potential breakout.

AMD earnings growth forecast is 40% and trading 40% below value vs NVDA earnings growth forecast is 25% and trading 25% over.

NVDA is huge and will pull big numbers but a dollar invested in AMD today, in my opinion will return more than a dollar invested in NVDA today over say a 5-10 year timeframe.; Volume of sales doesn’t matter that just has to do with market cap. NVDA growth is decelerating and AMD growth is accelerating.; The trailing pe is over 100 why is the forward pe gonna be so much different?; [deleted]; How did you know u/LordBagdanoff's real name is Sherlock?; Why buy amd when u can get NVDA at almost the same price lol; That’s interesting, thanks. I’ve seen a lot of people say, “Intel don’t have a chance, as once a data center switches, it’s almost impossible for them to switch back”. Seems like this isn’t true then. I guess the hardware is probably updated every 1-3 years and you just evaluate what is the best fit in terms of value for money & performance.; You’re mistaken indeed. 

Negative earnings growth? 

GAAP Y/Y Net income last qtr 

For Amd: 158% 
And for Nvda: 109%

Absolutely no idea how people are believing Nvda is a better opportunity currently; > Among gamers who build their own, most don't have a budget that justifies buying even a 7800X3D, let alone a 9800X3D.

5800x3D ($175 USD currently in aus) exists and is considered one of the greatest chips ever made.

7800x3d was sold out everywhere in every country for a long time. And when the 9800x3d launched it sold out everywhere within minutes. It has way better thermals, energy efficiency, and price to performance ratio than Intel's latest gen chips. (In gaming) That's crazy if you think about it, running on less power and lower temperatures but still outperforming Intel's flagships.

But yes it's not a huge market like NVIDIA has in AI. But I wasn't using this to boost AMD sentiment. I was merely pointing out that ""mindshare"" people have don't really translate to hardware like GPU and CPUs. IF by miracle  AMD makes a better GPU than NVIDIA, everyone will switch instantly. But no matter how great an Android phone is made, or if a BYD vehicle can outperform Tesla in every metric, people will not switch over easily.; Just funny how sentiment works. Everyone loves PLTR at 360 PE right now. AMD has been nearly cut in half from its peak and everyone who loved it at 220 hates it at 120. Every individual stock is litterally a pump in dump. ; If you have other gains to offset, it is almost always advantageous to harvest the tax loss. And if you still want to own it, you can always buy back in after 30 days.; When you think the stock is going to go down you should sell.; That's why I bought loads of Raytheon after Biden appointed a Raytheon board member as Sec of Defense. Right on cue the US started sending billions in Raytheon product to Israel and Ukraine!; bro 3080 is old af just get a 4090; Invest in both to diversify; NVDA's PEG ratio is 0.97, indicating that it's pretty close to fair value. AMD would have to triple in price to reach the same PEG.; Was replying to the previous message implying nvda reached its peak; Because the way the Xilinx acquisition was done. That’s what artificially drives up the current pe; Ha, except we have regulation now so it’s not really anything like that.; His mum told me when we were having a shag; the price of one actual share isn't relevant right? last year nvidia approached (surpassed?) $1000 per share, so they did a 10-to-1 stock split; Comments like this show how clueless redditors are; Brain cells have left the chat; Crazy they just let anyone open a brokerage account nowadays; Bruh; Lol what is market cap?; Bruh; Yeah whomever said it’s hard to switch back is absolutely wrong. Every company that “switched” to AMD came from Intel ecosystem and is now currently mixed and is likely doing fine. I know this first hand. So really, switching “back” might even be easier in some respects (amd does have a few extra knobs to get max perf from their cpus where intel are more straight forward).  Yeah im at a fairly large cloud company with many datacenters and we design yearly server builds with one being “new” and the next years is just a spec bump/refresh. So usually we work about 2 years out so 2-3 years to see a change in spending is fair.; Haha same!!! No actually I do, because I can clearly see most people don’t actually look at any important fundamentals. They shout about PE and Forward PE but they can’t even explain why it’s what it is. They don’t understand acquisitions or earnings forecasts or relative strength or the time value of a dollar.; >5800x3D ($175 USD currently in aus) exists and is considered one of the greatest chips ever made.

Without question, it's an amazing part. The list of people for whom it's a good idea to buy the thing is pretty short, though. It makes sense as a final upgrade for an aging AM4 system with say a Zen+ in it. For a new build, you're better served buying something else.

When it was a new part, it had the same overkill problem that 9800X3D has today. 9800X3D makes sense if you are building with a $2000+ budget and you have no productivity use case. There just aren't a ton of people like that. Gamers have mostly been well served to buy sub-$300 CPUs these past few generations. 

>I was merely pointing out that ""mindshare"" people have don't really translate to hardware like GPU and CPUs. IF by miracle AMD makes a better GPU than NVIDIA, everyone will switch instantly.

Everyone still hasn't switched to AMD from Intel in CPU land. Actually not even close. Intel still has 75% market share in x86 CPUs.; I wouldn't say AMD is a pump and dump, they are a good and profitable company that is also growing. But they were priced to be like an NVDA; >When you think the stock is going to go down you should sell.

After the stock has already gone down. So by that logic you're following the age old advice of selling low and buying high.; Diversification is another word for being a pussy. Half joking; Regulations are meaningless unless enforced. I don’t see the Trump admin enforcing much on this front…; Just leave these types to their ignorance; Well my $ is safer with NVDA 😛; Lmao joker; In the gaming CPU land it's a pretty major shift. There are many more use cases for x86 CPUs that x3D chips don't excel at, hence the market share number (wherever that's sourced from). Again I'm not arguing about AMD vs others. I'm just using AMD as an example.; Most regulations are local and it’s a wild leap to think companies will now be able to break federal law with no enforcement. Presidents in the US aren’t kings even if he wishes he were.; nah why not help them out - maybe it will get them started in investing n shit. or maybe i missed their point entirely; If you want safety why not go for t bills ; I hope you’re right, but banks and big tech are celebrating his win from an M&A perspective…; No you didn't miss any point. They're comparing stock prices at face value without regard for float/market cap"
73,Has anyone heard of an app called Silo markets?,"Hey all. I recently came across a video from Ryan Scribbner talking about an app called Silo markets, it seems to be a slick app for folks seeking bond investments, the vision seems to be designed for gen z, the UI seeming very Robinhoody... As I did research and followed his referral, it took me to this page of the app store. No android, or online option. 

However the reviews seem pretty solid, does anyone have more information how to get it on Android? Rn I'm with Fidelity but I'm not enjoying their software and there are hoops to jump through when buying or even browsing bonds. So I'm always open for new options.
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/silo-markets-bonds-indexes/id1630228218?see-all=reviews  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hi0rfk/has_anyone_heard_of_an_app_called_silo_markets/,0,2024-12-19 20:21:55,"I don't understand why people get drawn into these tiny little startups.

Silo is a tiny investment advisor that is only registered in Texas as an SEC 203A-2 advisor (ie an internet advisor).

They literally have only 2 employees who are probably the guys that wrote the app. 

They managed using Interactive Brokers - probably Ibkr's advisor platform. And their app probably is just a front-end for Ibkr's API.

As of April 2024 - they had the grand total of $23k in AUM. That's K as in thousands with about 283 customers.

It doesn't even look like a real company. They have raised no venture money that I can see. And it looks like a part-time project.

I'm not suggesting that it's a horrible company - but this company is more in the playing around stage.; Hey, that's already a ton of information that users wouldn't know, you seem to have gone down the silo rabbit hole if that's accurate, I appreciate it. However re-read my OP I do  mention that it's Robinhoody lol what I meant by that is the interface is sexy and to people like me who value simplicity, and tech savvy software over complexity, and corporate bank software silo is attractive, start-up or not. 

It's precisely why I'm here creating this thread in the first place, I'm not enjoying the fidelity process I'm using now, and every CUSIP or whatever has long ass names, and opens new tabs to see the bond details and then another to proceed with the buy."

Increase rates anticipating tariffs and deportation inflation and he would look like he is making decisions based on politics since he is not going by current numbers but rather what Trump is stating he will do. He would be making decisions on forward looking statements and speculation. 

Decreasing rates because of current data will make those who speculate take more loans and max their credit cards thinking that inflation will go sky high.

Consumers and businesses will be taking high risk buying things they don't need or want only because they think it will increase in value. Those items may not increase in value and if they do and they have adjustable rate credit cards or loans, their interests may increase higher than the inflation. 

Hoarding groceries only leads to more wasted food from spoilage. Even frozen food doesn't last too much past 6 months without freezer burn or lower quality. Rice, pasta, cereals can attract rodents and insects.  Canned foods last for years, but very easy to over buy and not consume because you know it lasts a long time and forget them. 

I know many people don't believe in trickle down economics, but it is in the best interest of the businesses to give 1/3 to lower prices, 1/3 to profits, and 1/3 to employees if they want to have conservatives win in 2028.

The lower corporate taxes, income taxes, and deregulation is an opportunity for the businesses to make voters happy and thus win the next election. 

Deportation is an opportunity to purchase drones to do agriculture and other work that immigrants usually do. They can say they give humans priority but since there are no humans applying, they have to resort to drones.

Now if we go to -30% or -50%, that would start to be interesting.; Wasn’t 2021 a year of insane highs?; Yes especially with trump coming in and slapping tariffs everywhere. I’m thinking minus ~10% broadly, could be more; What the fuck are you saying ? *We got warned for at least a week that the Fed was going to cut 0.25 point but announce that they would slow down cut because of inflation report, potential trump policies and job reports.*

The Fed give reason because they otherwise they would have had to instead raise interest rate to make people like you understand that the market is too high, inflation is too high and that we need to be more strict to avoid over heating the economy. So they warn long in advance what they plan to do so you hopefully get it.; Yes, act, don't explain. 

That would surely have made you happy. 🙄; Hey lil bud, inflation slightly ticked up. Everything is still unfolding like the Fed said it would.

It was flirting with 127 yesterday and shot up to 136 this morning only go drop back to 128 following the Powell smack down so I think that's support.

Market was ready to bounce but feds only cut rates by .25 points and more importantly lowered their forecast of 4 cuts to 2 for 2025… 

Come on playa, keep up!; When in doubt pinky out!; That was 1.5 hours and we broke 2 key levels of SPX resistance in that time.  I sold the lot at that point (5965) because it signals a lot more potential downside, and if nothing else some real uncertainty.  I went from being up >100% for the year to down 20% all because I wanted to minimize tax burned this year.  I'm a dingus.  I was successful in minimizing tax burden, though.  So that's a big win.

What decision? They made the decision they were expected to make. Interest rates are already historically low. If they cut rates every time there's a decision they'll have to start paying people to borrow money.

Powell took a non-political position and made it political.  He downplayed inflation for most of the year and then in September basically said inflation is no longer a problem, cut the rate by 50 bps and announced there would be 4 cuts in 2025.  This had 2 very predictable outcomes.  It caused the market to go up leading into the election and it also caused the most recent inflation numbers to rise.  Since the market had already priced in the 4 cuts he previously said this announcement yesterday caused the big drop to where the market probably should have already been.; Finviz.

The market rebounded so high some financial gurus on TV were embarrassed. This is the amazing thing about the market...; I lived thru the dotcom bubble right out of college, the great recession in 2008, and COVID in 2020 and I'm still UP.

btw, yeah, its end of the ""today"" you speak of ..and the market is still shit..; Was very surprising news. It was basically a pivot. They are forecasting higher rates for longer.

Lots of better opportunities around the world.

If the markets closed for 5years, I'd rather be holding to foreign stocks paying 6 to 10% div yields vs US stocks paying 1%; It is their official prerogative to set monetary policy and there will be always change in policy from time to time, obviously. They don't manipulate, they set policy.

These changes are made especially clear and in advance. It was known before the meeting what the Fed would announce with near certainty. 

The Fed use data like inflation + job reports + the global economy outlook. And the data mandated the slight policy change.  Their decision was reasonable and expected. You could read many articles in the news before that explained what would be the change.

If you can't even manage that and wet you pants for 1 day of fluctuations and have to complain about market manipulation for that,  you should not do short term trading.

I have more stable allocations that I sit on. 

That loss in that account over the last months isn't a realized loss; it's a loss in position value and I'm not worried about it because that account is still up way more than I ever expected.  What I'm doing is working there, I just didn't follow my own rules.  

I sold when it broke through second resistance because it signaled more downside, but I bought back at at healthy discount in premarket. 

I left a big chunk on the sidelines because this (over) correction isn't quite over, and I'm looking to average down.  SPX closed key resistance of 5972 yesterday, and there's good chance we'll see a bounce at 5840-5850, which will be my next buy in point to these riskier assets.    

Yes, I deviated from my general thesis because next year I'm not taking any income and investing a lot into my own businesses and didn't want to take the 40% tax hit when I can take a lesser hit next year.  So I held too long.; My position as of late is high risk high reward because it's all play money in the end and this is a fun game.  

That loss over the last months isn't a realized loss; it's a loss in position value and I'm not worried about it because I'm still up way more than I ever expected.  It's house money.   

I sold yesterday but I bought back at at healthy discount in premarket this morning.  

I left a big chunk on the sidelines because this shakeup isn't over, and I'm looking to average down.  SPX closed key resistance of 5972, and there's good chance we'll see a bounce at 5840-5850, which will be my next buy in point.  

 I deviated from my general thesis because next year I'm not taking any income and investing a lot into my own businesses next year and didn't want to take the 40% tax hit this year when I can take a lesser hit next year. So I held when I probably shouldn't have.; its really not that hard if the markets bullish  , trick is to accumulate , then dump

i mean i lost a grand in doge when it -25 + 25  in like 12 hours ,    if timed better or if i heldm y last position id be up grands,   

also i sold doge coin to buy kamala contracts and lost like 6k 

doge went up 25% right after

just because you make a bad trade, doesnt mean your bad at this.

just try to minimize your losses and move on and start growing again

btw you may want to stabalize your liqudity after a loss 

ie instead of doublign down or trying to make a quick buck real fast

  
dump the money on bonds a high yield cash for a few till u start again

prevents massive losses; Yeah you’re probably 20 then. Before you people could afford a house, car, family, groceries etc working at fords.; But but they said lump sum was better 🤣; I'm not timing the market necessarily rather if it's a company like NVDA or META that I think is fundamentally solid and will have significantly more upside than downside in coming years, when the stock price drops below my cost basis for one transient reason or another, I start buying into it every day on the way down until it rises back up above my cost basis. When I say DCA, is that I don't throw all of the uninvested cash I'm willing to put into it all at once once it drops below my cost basis but rather a percentage of it every day as I don't know how low it will go. Before this week it was above what I paid for it and I had no particular incentive to go buy more. Not really any timing the market per se involved here; I lost $10,000, so you’re welcome. 😉😂; The market is full regard. It will stay that way longer than your smarts.

|-|-|-|-|; Calm down.  Nobody is wetting their pants (or at least I'm not, maybe others are).  I actually think the current course is correct.   The problem was the September meeting where the economic data did not warrant a 50 bps rate cut or the announcement of 4 2025 cuts.  I think what came out of that meeting was largely political.  You can disagree.  The pullback yesterday is absolutely a reaction to the Feds about face since the last meeting.   Honestly the market has been overheated lately and was due for a pullback anyway.; actually u can make pretty good returns just use spxl or spxs   its 3x up or down , almost no bid ask spread,  in out at ez pricing; That hasn’t been the case since at least 30 years ago and the market has absolutely crushed throughout that time. ; So did I 😭; F; What you are saying is just not correct.  Powell cutting 50 bps in September and saying there would be 4 more cuts in 2025 was a sign to the market that inflation was fixed.  The 4 rate cuts were already factored into the market which is why there was a big selloff after Powell cut that to only 2 yesterday.  Saying the new president, who isn't even in office yet, had a bigger impact on yesterdays downturn than the guy who tried to manipulate the market leading into an election is laughable.; This is still not an issue really.

Different people will have different opinion but the Fed behavior is consistent.

They wanted a strong signal initially after waiting for a long time to lower rates. They did it and the market, economist and most people interested in the subject, got that message. The rationale was to not risk the economy with job report that were so-so at the time.

Now as things as going well on the economy and employment but on the other side the inflation is not lowering anymore, they refine their policy that is basically instead of lowering total of 2% from September to the end of 2025, they will likely lower 1.5%. That's fine and logical.

And we all know that if events/reports show that it is necessary they will change again the plan.

Their are steering the stuff with the data they have and do refine/change policy when they think is necessary. No reason to speak of market manipulation or whatever even if we don't all agree with the way they steer it in the small details.; Overall, yeah. But 2000 2008 2022 still exist and many new investors who just joined at this high may not be as well positionned as someone who had lot of time to compound; It’s still been a helluva year.; He did not say that. He said they would be cautious cutting rates and continue to monitor inflation. In September he specifically said they weren't going to cut rates every meeting.; I appreciate the thoughtful discussion.  I disagree that ""the Fed behavior is consistent"".  Inflation never got down to the target of 2%.  That is why throughout the year they held rates steady while at the same time suggesting there would be future cuts in order to keep the stock market going up.  If inflation had been under control they would have lowered rates sooner.  Then 1 month prior to the election they ""sent a strong signal""  by lowering the rate 50 bps.  They knew that would in the short term cause the stock market to spike.  They also knew that would cause inflation to rise but it would take longer for that data to show because inflation is a lagging indicator.  The 2 most recent inflation reports show that is exactly what happened which is why they are now reversing course and slowing the rate cuts.  We want to believe that agencies like the Fed are non-partisan.  I just don't believe they acted that way this year.; But they most certainly will be well positioned in 4 years if they just DCA. Unless the world ends.; 50 bps rate cut is not cautious.  25 bps would have been cautious.  People can disagree, but the 50bps cut in September (when the market was factoring in 25) seemed motivated more by politics then economic data.  He knew a large cut like that would spike the market leading into the election.  Now he is correcting back to what is probably actually the correct policy given the economic data.; That's your interpretation but there basically no proof. There was a bad job report at the same time and they were preparing to cut rate for a long time if you remember.; Depends if they blow all their buying power too quickly. Just look at people already ready to buy the dip. If they get rugged a few times it can make them long investors. 

Good luck finding support when it dumps with all the daytraders taking peoples money; Sometimes ""the world ends"" is exactly what you need. 3/20 was terrible, but not for me."

Hoping for a little spike around open and I can sell for what I paid for it and just wash my hands of the call.; 😂😂😂😂😂; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31225); Why does anyone listen to this man? ; Fuck man, I wish I didn't buy a Starbucks this week.

Jpow makes 2 billion in 2 days.; What kind of chart is that?; I don’t care what anyone says. 

J. POW is the absolute boss; I'm convinced he's the Grinch!  The clown could've waited until next year to drag down the markets, but nope, he just had to say it.; What is that chart called; He’s such a dick; I don’t care, TSLA is still going strong, been carrying my portfolio since the election.; Wen trump fire?; Good idea; If you bought them at the end of the day you got fire sale pricing 🔥; *its going straight down, better buy calls*; but is it the last time?; me too, about a half hour before the dip; I was going to buy my first calls today, but I know that when I buy stock, it goes down.

One red day and this sub cry’s uncle, bunch of over leveraged gambling addicts; Na fuck him I need somewhere to direct my depression; Market expected 75-100bps cut in 2025 and we most likely getting only 50. Not hard to understand that treasury yields would rally and stock market would fall; Its more the fact that the fed revised their expected rate cuts for 2025; I agree. This news should have pumped.; Yeah that's a nice Christmas present; Too many geniuses from subreddits like this make up the markets these days huh?  They think the FED is supposed to make their stonks go up.

This market has no idea what fun awaits for them over this next year.  I don't think the tariffs and field worker deportations have been priced in yet, along with levels of buffoonery never seen outside of fiction.; Guy jumped off house with dick out and landed right up my ass. 


I hate these crash landings. ; Tax harvesting at relative top, by quant and institutions to fund Christmas, into January rally probably. ; I was up 400% on my TSLA call.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*; You guys are buying the tip. I was told to do something completely different. I’m never going to Wendy’s again; Is this the rich person equivalent of people rushing to buy a 500$ TV on 5% discount.; Atta boy.; Ran out of cash today, gotta get bent over to get more for tomorrow. Everyone have a safe night. ; I’m on margin, calls and stock with avg of 42. I didn’t sell one thing today; Nah, since 2022 Fed Officials can't buy single stocks, sector funds, crypto, commodities, derivatives (futures or options), shorts, or buy on margin. It's congress members that still get to have all that fun...; Surely someone will investigate that; If your getting fucked for millions what'd the problem. Bend over. ; Brother, I live in southwest Virginia, you're basically Bill Gates around here if you're making 250k a year; He would be the poorest person on r/salary; Not only that, but they did exactly as they *should* do and are signaling what they should be signaling.; Nah, just investments. So unrealized losses.; I did not.; SPY is going to be higher in a month, this dip will 100% get shrugged off like every other dip does.; Not taking about the macro picture dude, I'm talking about the way it rallied green before Fed on the news it was going to cut and then when they did cut, the markert took a fat shit on my stocks. It's really not that hard to conceptualize everyones anger, READ THE FUCKING ROOM; Have they rallied though?; nah, stock market will shrug off this news and rally into a new high in 2025; don't even act like you (yes you) understand what you wrote, you probably asked Chatgpt to write a reply to me. I've likely been in the market longer than you so dont even tryyyyy to tell me what I understand or not, EW. Stay in ur lane lil bro; Was priced in 2 on Monday at a minimum. ; Yes - I understand that. But he later went on to say he doesn't really know if he will cut or raise for next year but said ""depends on sentiment"" and then he literally took questions saying he's bullish on the next admin... and still the market wiped its ass on my face ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275); It is like an option on the market now. ; Such a ridiculous stock too, revenue is slowing hard and profit is stagnating, still up 100% lol; That's why they are all coming here; I bought Google Calls and it's down 18%. That's not a big deal for me, since the amount was very small (As I said, it was the first time I used options).; You will regret it when they hit $15.26 🤣. ; We’re all going to Wendy’s if this continues; I was wondering why there's a line at the Wendy's dumpster; Since 2022? You mean that year that just happened?; But his wife‘s boyfriend can. ; They don't get to stuff all their money into a trust that does all that form them?; damn. so congress people can fuck the country in the ass, escape all blame/accountability, invest in stocks that they know their policies will effect either negatively or badly, and avoid all responsibility? and the fed chair cant touch a single type of stock trade except buying SPY, only gets paid $250k a year, and receives ALL blame when the stock market crashes and the economy isn't doing well?

no wonder the dude is stressed af. seems like the worst job of all time; Won’t be Nancy; And people should have sold all those overvalued stocks. I mean come on. P/e of 50-100 seems like the new normal now. ; As long as I don't look at my phone, it's all unrealized.; alright shut the fuck up then pussy; This is why I don’t like long term investments. Random bottom drop out and lose half over night; So what's the issue?; He's not going to do the opposite just to placate you degenerate gamblers.

I know you guys always shit bricks over even a 1% move, since you regards are 100X leveraged and still get wiped out somehow.; Did you even listen to what JPOW said? What part of the statement made the cut sound dovish? Maybe learn to listen before you read the fucking room; Isn‘t this the whole point? To dump before everybody else does it?; 10 yr went from 4.39 to 4.52 in a couple hours which is a pretty big move yes; I agree tbh, just explaining the immediate short term impact after the Jpow commentary; Seethe and cope harder; Saying ""he doesn't know"" surely sounds promising.; Wiping face with ass sounds promising behind any Wendy's. ; Luckily I got a bunch of TSLA last summer, so I’m still riding the wacky wave, an 8% drop ain’t that bad.; Thank you for the price point. Ok with you to put that on my Bingo card?; Took your tip put it in dip. Thats how we got here. ; Oh hey can you pick me up a double cheese with fries and a frosty.; Yeah, due of course to some super sketchy looking trades that occurred just before the pandemic in 2020.; Yeah, I remember when the change was enacted in 2022, Powell at a press conference was like ""all voting members at the Fed unanimously support and voted for making these changes. The last thing we would want is to impede the trust of the American people."" 

Then probably a month or two later, Pelosi was asked by the press if congress should not be allowed to trade and she was like taken aback by the question or suggestion, like ""of course we should be allowed to trade whenever we want - this is America!"" Haha.; She'll investigate what he bought that she didn't to see if he made more than her.; everything has to go up, by any means nessesary…; I was glued online last night. I realized myself into a catatonic stupor; Huh how would you lose half on long term investments though. Something doesn’t add up🤔; I’m only down 3% today so not a big deal.; You're so right. That's why I only buy options.; Never used margin ever. Wrong person, direct your anger to someone else who does and honestly — all shit aside, whatever someone does with their money is (wait for it) their money. Yeah, I know, crazy idea. But you getting mad over what someone else does with their money is none of your business ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882) but hey let me not keep you from your hate-train, go carry on; My favorite part was when he said ""the fed can't legally buy Bitcoin"" 🫠; He said the US economy was good and they expect it to be good going forward. 


SPY -3%; I listened to the meeting live, eat my dick; Was a genuine question. Thx; suck me off and make me cum harder ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31224); for you, anyday, just ask; [deleted]; Down 3% bought more, merry Christmas to my brokrage. ; qqq went down 3.6%. if you lost much more than that, you were probably being regarded. ; So why are you telling us what you're doing with your money? No one cares about you and your losses when it's telegraphed like a punch in an 80's teen movie; You're mistaken, I don't care what you do with your money.

I'm saying the FED isn't going to placate you, or people like you.

Anything else?; Not yet, it can't 😀; Not while he’s in charge. Next year we’ll get the constitution rewritten.; No problem at all; Stop I can only get so erect; Us? Who the fuck are you; ya, actually I’ll have a cheeseburger plain and medium fries. Include the ketchup in the bag please. thaaanks; The sad bastards that have to listen to your angry pissing and moaning."

[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse); I've seen this shit many times and I am surprised every single time, guess I learned nothing!; I’ve been buying QQQ puts for weeks.  Burnt my ass left right and center.  Bought my first QQQ call yesterday.  Instantly tanks…..; wait they can go down?; You haven't seen anything. Just this past August, the market tanked twice this hard and the VIX jumped to Covid/great recession/dot-com-bubble levels because the Bank of Japan increased their interest rates by *.1%.*

The market is complete bullshit, completely detached from fundamentals and reality, and the weakest call of it's bluff will cause days like today. 

And you have to play it that way.; United Healthcare up almost 3% though... is taking the piss.  The only green on the heat map.  We've angered the rich folks.; Well at least it's Christmas colors?; Finally! My retirement contribution that buying today coincides with a drop in the market. Silver linings right?; Wanted to buy Nvidia GPU for Christmas, gonna get myself Intel Arc B580 now. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267); Nah this was absurd. Complete overreaction.; crazy how UNH is the only green fuq outta here lmao; Market will bounce hard tomorrow after everyone realizes they sold into a strong economy.

He said there would be fewer rate cuts.

Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.; at least my DELL PUTS will print hard tomorrow; Sorry guys that was me buying for $40k today.; Im not gonna let this recession happen; How many times must it be said:

**Stock market =/= Economy**; United Healthcare 🖕; i started buying stocks this summer and would like to know if this is normal and fun or some sort of extinction event; I have many times and like a true regard I ALWAYS get fucked. Turns out I’m a shitty hooker because I pay to get fucked.; This market is priced about 3x the strength of the economy. Correction overdue; This is a case of 2 things:

1) Sell the news. The entire market has been pumping in anticipation of the rate cuts and today was the final one for 2024. So sell the news.

2) Most companies that reported gave a poor 2025 outlook. MU today just the most recent example.; UNH is up lol; I sold because of the aliens; Hurr durr stonks go up; It's because everyone knows under Trump there are dozens of his policies that are going to create insane inflation and Destroy anyone making less than $75,000 a year; This is all joe Bidens fault! Somehow...; Buy shitty penny stocks to stay cheerful, there’s always one or two going mental in the opposite direction to everything else.; So the stock market get murdered by JPOW and guess who is the last man standing : United Health Group. Coincidence, I think not; Zoom out on your chart, 2001, 2008, 2020, they all look like minor blips in the macro. When everyone is selling, I’m buying.; https://preview.redd.it/8oe68gphgo7e1.jpeg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b213cbfd43ef03a19ec7c8427182cd291dcfdb5

All I know is if I see VIX like this on a not that bad of a news, I’m loading all the calls I can get.; https://preview.redd.it/cbwg6fhdfo7e1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c054b485d0a4d92f4527089e8731ab1efb6011f2

👀👀; it's just a holiday sale. relax; OH NOO.

WE DROPPED BACK TO LAST WEEK LEVELS

AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH; It’s going to rip green, this is a buying opportunity; look at Healthcare, thriving amongst all that death.  Where's Luigi when we need him?; How do I find where to get this website of stocks; That motherfucking UNH is up!!! Luigi probably going nuts in his cell; lol when they say the economy is going well it means money is moving around. It doesn’t mean it’s moving to you; This is what you call an opportunity; Ok upvote for the title; It’s a fucking 2% pullback in the midst of the wildest period of 200+% price growth in history. Chill tf out people.; People are just tax loss harvesting; Buy the rumor, sell the news.; If you think the US economy is unwell, what would you call the Canadian economy?😂; I bought 10 calls this week on Monday due to bullish sentiment. Dreading tomorrow AM. Thanks; Bought 15 calls of TSLA expiring in 2 days @5.50

This is just a small bump.; NBD dude.  Market do wut it do.  Plan for it and ride it out.; Young chap, you have a lot to learn.; Why do people think ""the economy"" = the stock market? You can have a healthy economy and an overpriced stock market at the same time. And you can have a healthy (growing) economy that at the same time offers no value to the working class.; well doesn't this look festive or what.; The stock market isn't the economy.... Until it is![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); chuckles in extremely volatile micro cap; Calls on UNH; The real bullshit is spy had no business hitting 600 in the first place. Still overbought af at these prices.; I brought 2 12/27 590 around 3:00 should have went all in would have 4x smh; Does no one here understand the relationship between interest rates and growth stocks? Apparently not…; Gann day iykyk; Exactly wtf? 0.25% was expected and was all over the news. Don't give me BS reason about the guidance, it was all well known. Market makers just having fun at this point.; [removed]; he meant deep well; Wow healthcare holds hmmmmmm; Harris Teeter replaced all their carry baskets from green with red last week. The managers foresaw the sell off coming.; UHC. LOL; It’s a crime that’s forsure maximum sentence is 0 days in jail; Shows you how reliant the market is on the Fed instead of on the fundamentals of the economy.

The free market only exists in Bitcoin now.  Traditional markets have been completely pimped out and are now just an illusion of a ""market"".; Last trading hour was a big jpow fiasco; Priced in a course; Those healthcare plans tho 👀; 3 weeks, lmao; [removed]; Ahh yes, healthcare is up because our monthly payments for the life saving heart surgery will be lower.

Let me graze in the fields of green ![img](emote|t5_2th52|27421); This situation reminds me of  recent HOA meeting:

ACC chairman: With Bert leaving the ACC, I appointed Cedric to the committee.

Board President: You have no authority to appoint someone. The Board appoints ACC members. We would be glad to consider Cedric, but we are going to ask if others would also like to be on the committee. 

ACC Chairman: You don't like Cedric?

Board President: Cedric is a fine fellow, but you do not have authority to appoint anyone. Only the Board can do that, and we want to let any other interested to also be considered. 

ACC Chairman (interrupting): You don't like Cedric?; It's down because JPOW lowered the 4 expected rate cuts in 2025 to 2.; Market makers do what market makers do; How was it bs? Lol. The market was way above where it should be. We had a bit of a correction. The  U.S. economy is in shambles. We haven't had more than a 10%pb in a while. Today was only 3%. Honestly, there is no reason we aren't in a full-blown recession as many other countries have gone in lately. All you can do is say, market gonna market. Trade what they give, not what you want. As soon as momentum slows, get out, stay green, and wait for the next entry.; What goes up, must come down....

Glad I took some nice profits out in 2024....

Now wait for some lows to buy back into...

S&P down less than 3%.... everyone: WTF IS GOING ON!!! OMG!! MY PORTFOLIO!!!; Uber calls; Fed rate cut = dump
Fed rate increase = pump
Earning beat = dump
Earning miss = pump; I’m so glad I sold my TSLA this morning before it tanked…..; I had some hedging puts and covered calls which saved me somewhat. Now it’s time to buy the dips. Now watch NVDA 🚀 and everything else will piddle around. 😂; Fucking pussies; Market wanted more than a 1/4, needed a 1/2.; Quantum computing still jerking; QUBT up 50%; *Opportunities (Let's Make Lots of Money)*; You’ll be ok. Just double up on your blood bank deposits?!; Also, really giant dick punch that equities and crypto are now a correlated relationship.  Oh, and bonds too. 


Almost like 12 people control 50%+ of all assets and when they get sad everyone gets it dry up the ass.; It's just our obligatory L's for the month. Nothing to see here.; Fairly typical rug pull, IMHO.; Kinda early for the so-much-winning rug pull; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640); I believe it’s an intentional cash grab collusion. Good news is coming so the plebs buy the news, initiate massive selloffs to incite panic selling for several days, then buy up all the cheap stonks.; Lol -- 3 weeks of trading; Guy has been trading for 3 weeks like he’s allowed to even have an opinion on the stock market 😂; Volume on Tesla dropped off in the first 15 minutes of trading, nvidia fell below support yesterday, markets are looking for the next big thing and it will be in the form of unmanned aircraft as AI data centers come online; most importantly UNH is UP; Meanwhile whoever bought 0dte 600 strike SPY puts before Powell spoke made an easy 15000% on their investment.

Lucky bastards.; 'Economy is doing well' means they might start doing QT again for a couple of months before another crisis makes them reverse and enrich the .001% again to keep the house of cards up. 1/2 of the stock market is basically fueled by QE liquidity.; So time to get back into TSLA again then, yeah?; Yeah except they got rid of one of the rate cuts and still did not stop the balance sheet run off and now we have a government shutdown on our hands; Tax loss; UNH is the one of the few that's up...; United healthcare is up? Hope Luigi had calls…; Economy is not stock market; Holy shit America is a riot, health care plans are the only thing in the green; After reading that people need a Christmas rally to break even despite being 23% up ytd tells me that half the sub is going to be wiped next year 🤣🤣; Apparently they didn't like Brian very much either; I’m a seasoned trader with over 2 months experience.    
I’ve seen this shit happen a lot, usually just before a big bull run, or a big bear sell off. Sometimes it’s just before a big flat period of not much happening.; Is that teeny tiny green box in technology for SOUN? One of very few tech stocks that did well today.; UNH had a streak of luck recently.; I cashed out last week and bought a smallish position on the market tanking by last Friday. Only 3 trading days off, I would have flipped $300 into several grand, RIP. Still I locked in 85% on the year, can't complain too much.

  
Now to chill for a couple of months and buy back in when the tanking truly starts.; Buy the dip; Congrats to UNH holders. Keeps denying those claims; Somehow the only thing up is UNH 😂; Lmao, tiny little pullback and the sky is falling.; Welp it was a good 3 weeks; What i tought the market was free money and never went down ? SMH Biden what did you do to me; Bunch of fucking whiners... One bad day and boo hoo... What about the last two fucking years where we've all gotten rich.

You will learn this in you 4th week of trading.; Why would ""well - effectively"" be equivalent to ""great"". Obviously the market has greatness prices in, earnings is only 3% of S&P.; Lmao fucking UNH satan’s mistress; The dot plots are the reason.; Its probably Elon fucking with us all. He can pump it and sell it all without denting his wallet.; i haven't been paying much attention (broke AF) but i kept seeing SPY soaring and thinking ""damn, would be nice to grab a few puts soon""; All they did was talk about sticky inflation. If you bothered to listen puts was an easy play yesterday; Damn I thought these things happen every other hour; I too am a market maker🍆; Bullshit? The fed said they don’t want to cut rates as much next year as they might’ve … the market responded completely predictably to that new info?; You guys know they have to do this to get the Santa rally going right? Vix was too low and we had too many calls. Now retail will turn bearish and we melt up led by semis; JPow is a knave, not a knight; To be fair we hit all time high just needed some dweebs to hold the bill when the rich cashed out lol; Ooh look you have a square of green on yours!

No need to flex.; lone star $UNH; Okay. Thats not what he said. They cut the number of rate cuts next year back from 4 to 2, and he implied they may just do 1, and probably later than expected. Thats plenty enough of impact on leverage for growth and thatch PEs to drive this kind of action.; 3 weeks of trading!   A professional now 😀.     Market is now spoked about only two rate cuts.; If you’re an experienced trader you know the market dips this time of year, every year.; Good day to be buying today....  I picked up a few good deals:

AMD has potential.

Thx jpow; I'm assuming you were born in 2009; The market is not the economy; He also said ""We don't know what that Orange idiot will do but so far his ideas will bring back extreme Inflation and we are not excluding rate hikes"" 😂; Happens at the end of the year, every year, since the dawn of bull markets. How is all of WSB this surprised? I don't understand.; The market doesn‘t reflect economy… if it would, we would still be at 2021 levels; US economy is well, therefore no longer need for cuts = red; I sold my rivian stock about an hour before the s&p tanked and BOY I AM GLAD I DID THAT

Now i got some extra cash to use now that everything is on sale; Must be new here... welcome to FOMC; That is quite a pancake….; https://preview.redd.it/7v6w6szhkr7e1.jpeg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=90a70ab4167e24897d014463b0a989255b1303dd; Lol 3 weeks he says..... Talk to me in 10 years; If I am reading the room right, there is one good thing in this chart to give everyone some xmas cheer - the only oasis of green is healthcare plans.; Confidence down; Fed announces a 25 point interest cut and whales start dumping........how does this make sense?? They said that less rate cuts will happen in 2025 but still why panic sell off good news......??; United healthcare seems to be doing good ,maybe a space in there capital open up; Reduced rate cuts in 2025 did this

Who saw that coming considering the US economy is doing well apparently?; US economy is not options / margin trading. Wake up fool; Care to see European markets so you can stop crying. U.S markets have done well so shut up and be grateful.; Hang around it gets worse then better. Then worse again.; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267); What is this, a green square for ants?; This was visible days away, just look at the bullish run, it was too steep. It all started with the ""trum*p trade""; JPOW sctewwed up many Christmas hopes. Fuck him; 3 WEEEKS!!! God damn dinosaur.; Market goes up for months and people celebrate… goes down for a day and everyone loses their minds.; Every time I think I’m one step ahead, the market makers are sixteen steps ahead. I can’t fucking win with this shit. I’m just at a total loss for words HOLY FUCKING SHIT; Its simple. 

We are taught and repeated it's already factored in. 

Its NEVER factored in. Ever. 

Too many people are chasing irrational returns at all levels for that to occur. 

Tsla a prime example. They have to replace MULTIPLE  entire industries to reach an equivalent value. 


MSTR is a god damn ponzi scheme based around pretend money that only has value because we as a people say, yeah that imaginary thing has value. It's now part of the actual index. 

All while AI bubble keeps building....but as of right now ZERO ROI to actual results. 

2025 is going to suck.; ""Just when I think I'm out, they pull me back in"" - Sil; Seriously, the market isn't allowed to dip?; Fr. I'm not mad at JPow. I'm mad at myself for not seeing it coming.; Can you please buy QQQ puts again. Thanks.; U bought calls after a giant green streak into FOMC interest rate day…. U belong behind Wendy’s; Same shit happened to me. I spent a month paper trading gold futures in preparation to day trade it. By the end of the month I was entirely too confident. I blasted my way on to thinkorswim  one morning in my undies, dick swinging... I set up a trade, executed and then threw my feet up on my desk, hands tucked behind my head. 

Within seconds the price dropped so fast it blew out my stop loss. My arms immediately sort of dove from the back of my head for the keyboard and mouse, twisting my body and pulling my feet off the desk. The chair somehow found new life in its wheel bearings and skedaddled the fuck out of their causing me to land square on my ass. 

So there I was a 26 year old man. In my undies, sitting on my butt, reaching up to my desk like a toddler to his parents. As I got up, I was locked into the price it had already dropped -$500.  By the time I got up, got the sell order in, and sold, I lost $800. I was devastated. That was the worst feeling ever. Mostly because my gf loaned me some of the money cause she saw me paper trading and was confident in me. Ugh. Just writing about it bums me out... Definitely learned from that lesson though.; Bought a weekly SPY put this Monday. Sold it today at 8:43am for a 50% loss. If I held it until the days end, I would have made 600% 👍🏻; So you’re the reason …; Maybe just buy and hold etfs?; Just a dip and thus buying opportunity!; As long regards keep buying the dip, there won't be any dip, it's a mere blackfriday sale.   
We have unlocked the secret of stocks, when it dumps, you pump, as long we keep pumping, we can keep the value of our stocks, well until we run out of money to pump, that's why we need interest to go 0 or negative, we will just borrow and keep pumping.; Japan has another decision coming so more unravelling of the arbitrage trade might bring additional headwind.; *This*

And this is why the market *is a Wendy’s*.

When your Company’s 401k guy comes for his annual visit, tell him that you’d rather gamble than max your contribution at irrational ATH’s.; This is why Warren B is sitting in cash and T Bills and chilling out as us guys load up on 0DTE options and bet it all; Valuations run on memes in 2024, and vibes in 2025. DOGE HAWK CAWK MICROPENILESTRATEGY Coin runs this bee-otch.; I remember this day, i was in market since 1 month ago 🤣; I mean that was more than three weeks ago so; its because United Health Care saved money on end-of-year CEO bonus; The market has determined that CEOs cost more than they’re worth.; noob here, where do I get to view this map please ?; Green for Luigi, oh wait.; Because it was already incredibly down.; So is uber and all the quantum meme stocks …; Glad that I own 15 shares of this bad boy 😎


Sad that I am still slightly in the red with it bcs I bought before the real dip :(; ITS ALWAYS CHRISTMAS COLORS. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|27421); That's the spirit!!!; My employer is getting bought and they're doing a dollar-for-dollar equity swap for employees. Tank everything for another month and then rebound because my half of the dollar-for-dollar is fixed and the buyer's is still floating ; Integrated graphics card for me...; another dip tomorrow I am going get a Raspberry Pi, lol.; Economy was great in 2024

We avoided recession

But we have 2 instead of 4 rate cuts which means we’ll never get rate cuts ever ever again so dump everything; SPY back where it was in Mid-Nov, this was nothing. It can fall a lot more if the market actually gets spooked; When the market trades like a meme stock, it can also drop like one. Even after today, QQQ is still up bigly for the month.; Paper hand cucks; Bounce back green by 1PM tomorrow; Market is down 3% and shiller PE is at its third highest value ever?


3% has never once in the history of the market been an over-reaction. 50% has been an over-reaction before. 


Losing 50% from these levels would make valuations *average*.


If we lost 70% from this level we'd still be looking at valuations more than double the 1982 minimum.; All I know is shit ain’t gonna get better with Mr Make it 2% or Ya Fired’s dumbass coming in.; It’s almost like it’s a bullseye on a target.; So is BCE lol; Yup.  

It's not Monday, so can't be a crash!  

Time to reload.; This is what I'm hoping on.  

  
Never had a >10K swing in one day before.  Especially in the wrong direction.; Well, i suggest you go against your instinct ![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787); yeah... strong economy...; Sure hope so.  I bought calls at close.; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640); This. Basically they're indicating uncertainty next year.; Then after that, change your last name to Burry.; Just put the fries in the bag bro; The world as you know it is over. Go get a generator and stock pile food cans.; I've been buying for two years. My port is mostly VTI/VOO so it mostly follows the market. This dip is not even remotely bad if you're buying and holding. People are upset on here because they yolo'd their life savings on 0dte calls.; It's normal.  Happens a few times a year.  It's buying the dip opportunities.

Most market crashes happen on a Monday.  Just check the day, and if not Monday, all good, buy the dip.; just look at the history of SPY and you will see there are a lot of periods of stagnation and drops; I started buying this summer too.  Right after I lump summed into VOO it went down quite a bit.  It has since recovered and I’m still up.  Once this bottoms out I’ll be investing again; A 3% dip is inconsequential. If you’re even slightly afraid run now. It’ll only get worse. ; Yeah I hate the word correction, but it fits today.; So dump mu TMR on open and take the losses or hold it till Friday?; Maybe 175; Thanks Obamabiden; Well. Even some Mr. T. stated not to replace a certain Mr. p. …; WeBull pre-market screeners for the win.

Coffee... load the screener, hover the cursor over the name, check the volume and chart thumbnail, swig some more coffee, and choose.  Like picking a race horse from the paper.  Worth a gamble.; I’m pretty new to this so forgive me, do you mean VIX calls or calls in general?; I swear the wealthy do this just to keep the paperhands poor so they have to keep going to work; No its not. Technical data is teaching you degens some lesson.; Stocking up with some in the old long portfolio in the morning. 

New ATHs incoming.; Finviz has a nice homepage that has it.   

Posted this exact same post here about three or four years ago, with almost the exact same title, and the most common reply, was people asking where to find the heat map.  Since then, most sites have the heat maps.  WeBull desktop app has a good one too, which is clickable.; Yep. Over the last four years,  whenever the daily red heat maps get posted.... is the reload signal.; Isn’t that when people sell at a loss though? Aren’t the markets up bigly this year?; Buying puts on Maple Syrup now I guess.; Considering you didn’t even provide your strike imma say yes; Finviz has a nice homepage that has it.   

Posted this exact same post here about three or four years ago, with almost the exact same title, and the most common reply, was people asking where to find the heat map.

I think I saw a post about it... or wait, that was someone with their cat's paw in-between two Oreo cookies.  Must have confused the algos.

Isn't there some old thing that when Oreo has double stuffing, markets tank?; You know what I’ve noticed? Nobody panics when things go “according to plan.” Even if the plan is horrifying! If, tomorrow, I tell the press that, like, a gang banger will get shot, or a truckload of soldiers will be blown up, nobody panics, because it’s all “part of the plan”. But when I say that one little old mayor will die, well then everyone loses their minds. Introduce a little anarchy. Upset the established order, and everything becomes chaos.; Its going down but the scenario is the same as last December when it irrationally pumped hard; https://preview.redd.it/2mlplscj2t7e1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8c6b5a3c933a0f68c0d91e9c5a19d4330fa668af

To be fair the red candle on the daily chart from yesterday is wildly large compared to a typical daily candle; https://preview.redd.it/bjzun3b8av7e1.jpeg?width=941&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf17302e8874a405e2b91a010ec4649baa4b7750; Market makers don't really care which way the market moves. They make $ on the spread while hedging to be delta neutral.; You’d still be up 24.5% on the year even after todays drop lol.; Stop gambling like the degenerate moron you are try to pretend to be intelligent and invest 😂😂; I mean what do you mean though - the markets ripped up for a long time with barely any corrections...; The stock market has been going up obnoxious amounts the last 4 months…; Literally everything has value because we as a people say it has value; Zero ROI on AI is crazy good luck though; only has value because we as a people say, yeah that imaginary thing has value.

You just described money.; >ponzi scheme based around pretend money that only has value because we as a people say, yeah that imaginary thing has value.

This is how all money works, a $5 bill is worth $5 because everyone agrees that piece of paper is worth $5.; Amen brother; AI can have ROI whenever it wants to.

The AI are still learning now, and already tons of people are using them right now (for free). Companies are even restructuring around AI by downsizing staff count.

Once AI is entrenched into business operations, all they have to do is kick in the subscription fee and companies would have little choice but to subscribe, because it's still cheaper than paying for more employees.; You’re smoking something good.  AI has zero value?  Why was UHC using it to $23b of profit ?   

It has tremendous amount of profit.  So many $150k/year white collar finance majors who will be out of a job in the next 2-3 years..  and that’s just one function..  add operations, IT automation, etc.  only folks safe are the trades..; !remindme 1 year; Let me know when you when you buy calls and I’ll buy a put for you.; you should write a book; https://preview.redd.it/r3jjt48kmr7e1.jpeg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3a9b0829283e8163ea5212e7f0c14c454646eee9; That’s tough!; Too smart for wsb; Now where’s the fun in that; What happens if has been dipping since sep30 and you buy every dip everyday. I mean I'm just constantly buying dips.


I'm just a dipshit at this  point. ; In the words of Tony Montana in Scarface ""I'm reloaded!""; Yeah, stocks are back to their level from about 2 weeks ago. It's practically the chance of a lifetime.; When’s that happening; My question is, is it really irrational or just inflation coming to the surface? M2 money supply has more than doubled over 10 years. Steady 5-10% levels. Inflation figures are pretending there‘s barely any inflation.      

Everyone assesses overpriced markets pointing at the Buffet indicator. But since this indicator was invented the money in circulation has quadrupled. Inflation rates do not seem to represent this as far as my limited amount of brain activity can detect. 

So while I agree with unstable markets, they aren‘t irrational ATHs if there‘s lots of hidden inflation. Which clearly there is. Now if I had more brain cells I could tell you if the quantity theory of money inflation is any more accurate than the figures we’re being told and what difference it would make if we used these  figures instead. I will research it tomorrow and share my findings. Just kidding I will yolo my life savings into Microstrategy as soon as I feel like it has dropped enough without doing any further research into anything at all because being financially irresponsible is trendy and I was told to not bet against market trends.; The cash isn't an investment, he parks it so he has it liquid in order to make acquisitions when the valuations are appropriate.; Thx for the good laugh homie XDD; C suite culling by investor hired hitmen is the sick new trick to maximize profits; I bet I'm not the only one belly laughing reading this.; They not only saved millions on the bonus but they saved millions more on the DOJ investigation for insider trading wherein the insider is now deceased 🫠; Take my award, you beautiful redditor.; Oh that was reaaaal dark; Imagine if he had a 50B pay package coming before something happened to him, stock would go nuts; Shhh the shareholders might actually start sending their own hitmen; Finviz. 

Though most places probably do em at this stage.; IM TRYING TO BE POSITIVE; Look at you all rich mf'ers.  Etch a sketch for me.; look at mr money bags over here with his fancy integrated graphics; 2-4 = -2 so math checks out!; We changed the definition of recession so that we no longer have them lmfao; to be a bear about this for a moment:

the US is the only economy not in a recession, and even then certain sectors of it (tech, manufacturing, white collar shit in general) are, we even changed the definition of what a recession *is* for the last 2 years, literally every single quarter of jobs data was faked upward/downwardly revised, the Fed has not hit their target on inflation at all and things continue to get more expensive, zero movement on housing, earnings are literally made up, companies like PLTR are trading at 300x forward revenue, AI startups and crypto scamming is back, ChatGPT is garbage and is already over the hump of being obviously worse than a over 100 IQ human, ceos are getting murked in the streets and everyone's cheering.; Funny thing is when we were projected to get 5 rate cuts in 2024 and we only got three, markets continued to rally all year long with no issue. Today was a total overreaction. Sure we might see some short term selling but you can book it, Q1 25, possibly around January or end of February they’ll be pumping this shit again for the next several months.; upvote because I want to believe; Or a continuation, 50/50; We also didn't have foreigners investing from afar, retail traders gambling from their toilet, and 401ks creating a constant lift.

Markets will be elevated as long as US is dominant. 2025 is vastly different from the 1980s.

Oh. Let's also forget to mention the rates back then vs now. And let's forget about the Fed and government propping up the market and bailing the market out if it starts falling too much.

Hate to say it, but it's different. I'd prefer cheaper prices but there's too much buying pressure in the modern era. We'll have another epic crash by the end of the decade where you can buy before it recovers. Be ready, kids, shit moves fast when you're flinging it around.; you know shit all. just like all of us. that's why we are here. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); Still baffles me that like 70 percent of his voters will cite a desire for lower prices as their reason, specifically oil/gasoline, when his plans will without a doubt make everything, ESPECIALLY oil, more expensive.; UNH is in my sights, for sure.  But remember, there's no silver bullet.; Funny shit, but most red days are actually Fridays, so... Fingers crossed ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31225); 30K here, one of my bigger losses.  Good time to pick up things on sale, but don't try to catch a falling knife, I learned that the hard way.; $20k today. Had to take a walk for a bit just to remind myself I’m not going insane; You must have not been trading during the last trump admin…; Agreed.

And specifically mentioning policy was unpredictable and specifically saying they can't buy BTC; And ""Under the Dome"" DVD seasons, just in case you hesitate with the last bullet.; I’m buying and holding! My port is down a little but when I add in the BTC I also bought I’m still in the green; So, like 90-95% of people? Lol; be an institutional first mover and sell off your positions to tank the market > buy the dip > bounce back > ez gains; Lmaoo; Both you and the comment you’re replying too….well done 😂; 🤡; Good point, maybe I am just a psychopath or a narcissist... but I judge the world off what I think is morally/ethically right or wrong. It often causes a lot of strife in my life when I speak my mind.  Fine line between thinking the world should evolve around you and risking gullibility.; So many people don't get this. I've worked as a market maker and we never touched options. We didn't care about which direction the market went.; Can you put this in regard terms; Explain it to me like I’m an 🦍; Spreads are the shit; This might as well be chinese. Yes I know that I am not there to understand but yea…….; That isn't the defense of an intangible asset no matter how often that's repeated.; For workers totally. 

But its akin to the internet. 

90 to 2000 man look at this opportunity! This innovation its amazing!

|-|-|-|-|; Calls on your portfolio.; Who sells a SPY put two days before a quad-witching day FFS?; Don't forget that there are people who bought the stocks yesterday and thus before the dip; “You fuk with me? You fukking with the best!” - JPOW, probably; In five hours; Don’t disagree, to an extent.

But, best case, the market has largely priced that all in by now. 2x since Covid. There is a lot of room to the downside for shaking out.

Draw a crayon line from 08 top to Pre-Covid top, to  2022 bottom and keep going…

That line doesn’t get to current levels intil **2030**; Don’t worry, the real comedy is yet to come; Rich CEOs hate this one simple trick…; They actually probably got paid millions via key man insurance; Hahahhhaha; I use pen and paper; Even when we had two quarters of negative growth this year, a technical recession, markets shrugged it off and continued to pump. 

They won’t let the indices crash significantly, *if* they can help it.; Chatgpt is good dude. I made a picture it drew of the market reacting to jpow's speech but reddit is being dumb and wont let me post it. But it was funny.; Seeing the reaction in here is bizarre. I’ve noticed the same as you and have watched stocks skyrocket in price to crazy valuations based on very little substantive metrics for months. 

This baby dip is nothing compared to what should happen. But I’ve learnt not to be a bear in fantasy bull land.; Stop. Reddit won’t believe the economy is shit until January 20th.; With everywhere reporting that the DJI is down badly for the first time since Carter was president, while the SPY had like 9 straight green days.  It was gonna come eventually.  

Reloading opportunities in abundance.; Only 4K, but that’s in my “Safe” growth portfolio which makes it all the worse; No problem with catching a falling knife, as long as you commit to continue to catch it; Yeah, I switched my view to ""all time returns""  to see some green and remid myself I'm actually up; We’d like it to be 99 but 95 we will accept; Exactly. It's actually so easy. Can't believe many people don't get this. Basic game-theory modeling would guarantee it.; Had a few background noise YT market streams going while JPOW was speaking, most were mainly people rejoicing with their strangles.  Opening bell tomorrow going to be wild.; I worked as a market maker and of course we made a market in options. That's what options market makers do. I worked on the open outcry floor of the Pacific Stock Exchange (which is now a gym). Where did you work?; Hedge funds essentially need to fuck retail traders for their liquidity right? I was just watching that leaked Jim Cramer video from ‘06 where he’s talking about it (I think the interview was supposed to be for some insiders club or some shit because he says in the beginning ‘this is the kind of stuff I wouldn’t say on tv’) so when they’re using retail for liquidity it got me thinkin (as I’m getting into options) about who they’re fucking and whatnot, it’s it essentially holders and sellers they’re using rather than options traders? Because it kind of seems like options trading is riding those waves the firms and hedges are creating; House always wins.; Market makers are bookies. They don't give a shit which team wins, as long as you make lots of bets; Market maker like same thing as flying man baby with heart arrow. Pair two people together to initiate transactions. Charge fee for transaction. These fees called ""spread"".; MMs are hedge to where price moves don't really hurt them. They make money by buying at bids and selling at ask prices. You can basically be a market maker yourself but there's actually regulations around it. I don't know the specifics. You would also need loads of cash to provide sufficient liquidity for the stock.; But it is because that's the value a lot of people have agreed upon. It doesn't matter if the store or value is something intangible such as binary flowing through cooper wires or green paper printed with symbols of long dead people. At the end it's the same thing, a bunch of people agree that XYZ thing has a certain value; Average redditor opinion is 2-5 years behind what's actually going on which is already 6-12 months behind what's being built; Yeah, that's me a couple of days ago buying avgo.


I also bought smci the damn day it dropped like a freaking rock!; Priced in; At the same time people have never been as financially literate as today. Supply and demand. If there‘s more money AND more players then the current valuations could be at a healthy level.   

The fact that VIX jumped pretty high and the markets went down so much based on very little pessimism seems to hint towards your assessment being more likely.    

However once Buffet puts his cash into the markets it won‘t matter that much how bearish the outlook is, supply and demand. So I feel like we‘re at the mercy of market makers, orange man, winnie poo and a KGB agent or so it would seem. There‘s no precedent so anyones guess is as good as mine.; That's because it's never about interest rates, it's about language control.  If you can give a Jpow-level speech with a straight face and some bigly words, the market might piss & moan (or even moon!) *but it will generally accept the absurd idea that there's a brilliant adult in charge somewhere*.  That there is at least the concept of a plan.    
  
What's a ""technical recession"" if someone says everything is fine and someone else is in the back making sand into machine gods?  Doesn't matter if it is all profitable, efficient, or even wise.  Only matters that the real possibility of profit *could* be there.

A market this large on a fragile and unstable Earth is inherently a sleight of hand. The truth behind the curtains is just this and nothing more:

*The speed on the money-printing crank varies.  According to the desperation we feel.  Whether or not any of you make money is entirely up to sheer, dumb luck.*  
  
*And if things get really bad?  We beg congress for the XL Kinkos Bailout Macro-Printer 5000. Then 10 years later the economy will be mostly recovered (usually).*; That was my problem. Chased it all the way to zero lol; https://preview.redd.it/6a2wvy12ip7e1.png?width=187&format=png&auto=webp&s=17c11710f0621cd429151f1c1dc41130bd2dfa02

84,Dow Jones Industrial Average's WORST streak in 46 years,"While US equities churn near all-time highs, one of the most closely watched indexes is mired in its longest losing streak since Jimmy Carter was president.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen nine straight days, the longest string of losses since 1978. The 30-stock index is down 3.5% over that stretch. 

The index has been dragged down primarily by UnitedHealth, the insurer whose shares have been in a tailspin since the Dec. 4 shooting of executive Brian Thompson. Notable gainers include mega-cap tech names Amazon, Apple and Microsoft  — though they provide less of a boost to the stock price-weighted Dow than they do for the cap-weighted S&P 500.",https://i.redd.it/accuczoeom7e1.png,63,2024-12-18 16:46:27,"The Dow is antiquated.

|-|-|-|-|; You woke me for this?! That’s nothing but a fart. Zoom out: Where we are today was an all-time high a month ago. Even if SPY goes to $525 it’s only wiping out half of the gains for the year. Let me sleep…

Edit: initially quoted VOO price. Now using SPY; Its a shell game of moving building expectations and leaving people with bags.

Some of these valuations have no basis in reality if money is a real store of value. The P/E of most companies is insanely high.

We're just lucky we're in 'too big to fail' zones. Until it fails that is.; Right. So a majority of Americans contribute to retirement savings, but that’s just percentage of people who are contributing. Vast majority of the actual wealth is still held by the oligarchs; [removed]; Maybe I'm getting jaded, but this reads exactly like an AI generated comment; The call options these maniacs are buying on Tesla are blowing my mind. I just saw a post with 1600 call options with a  $800 strike expiring in early January bought for 160k. Eventually the hedge funds will clean these guys out.; Use logic here, my friend. If 70% of Americans are contributing to a 401k for retirement, and stocks decrease in value, what happens to the retirement savings of 70% of Americans?

Hint: they are in fact affected - I’ll let you figure out how; But that wasnt your original point. Now youre making a new, non related one. Good job. A vast majority of people actual wealth is held in the market. 70% of people who contribute have most of their $$ in their 401ks. Im sorry you dont contritube to such benefits.; And?

Yes, they dont have as much money invested. But that means the money they *do* have is more important to them.

If you have 100k or 200m, a 3% drop is still a 3% drop.; I’m not irritated at all by your comment, it’s just misguided and ill-informed. If as an individual, you don’t invest in the market, your future self is missing out. Even $50 a month will have a massive effect over 20-30 years. 

Plug in $50 a month to a compound interest calculator, with 7% (inflation adjusted) return for 25 years. That’s what investing in the S&P’s typical returns are modeled at. It’s worth it.; Beep boop; You'd think but I feel like 1) he's the shadow president and 2) its too big (of the stock market) to fail.; Yes, it impacts anyone with a retirement account. I totally agree with you, but the other poster isn’t entirely wrong in terms of who sees an outsize impact from market activity. The top 1% of shareholding Americans own 50% of the market. Expanded to the top 10%, they own over 90% of the market. The bottom 50% own less than 1%. 

Many Americans have access to 401ks and barely leverage that asset, unfortunately. But also, even if they fully take advantage of it to the tune of $23k a year, that’s still chump change compared to what a guy like Bill Ackman can do in a day.; Who cares? Majority of us won’t be able to retire anyways. I’ll probably have to pull my 401k to pay some bullshit medical debt because United Health will weasel its way out of paying for urgent care me or my family needs. All to help make our gracious, powerful, oligarchic overloads more wealthy.; Wow you’re so smart; People assume that concise and articulately worded comments might be AI. 🤷  in fairness, probably in a year, we won't be able to tell the difference. Maybe we're just two bots talking to each other?

Anyway, nice clarification on VTI.; Tesla is 2.5% of the S&P 500 and at this level and I’ll put on a small short to at least partially offset what I passively own in SPY. It should drop on Q4 earnings or when these regards stop rolling calls.; If the stock market goes down, rich people will have fewer vacation homes and the rest of us will have to work years longer. It’s an outsized impact on us, not them.; Nihilism is not a path to happiness; A professional victim in his natural habitat.; Thank you! :); ""haha you just called yourself smart. You guys are such losers. You guys take yourselves so seriously"" Why did you delete your reply? I thought we are the ones who take things so seriously?; Do LLMs understand/use emojis yet? Maybe that’ll be our ‘human’ signature  
🤖+😊=🥸; Natural habitat being the stockmarket subreddit lol; 🤖🚫💻🔓👽💥; You are literally talking about how the stock market is a bunch of predators. You’re less intelligent than I originally thought.; I mean, you’re still replying so feelings are mutual. Gonna see how long I can keep this going on for lol; Unfortunately for you I’ve not said anything that is incorrect or even my opinion. 

You are, quite literally, pre-oppressing yourself while stating the stock market is for rich people trying to fuck the middle and lower class while also maintaining that it’s a place for victims. I’m not sure you even know what your own stance is anymore.; So this was a lie."
85,How have you utilized algorithmic investing for your trades? ,"For some background, I’m probably the typical retail investor, but I tend to shy away from the “meme stocks” and have more of a buy and hold strategy. I tend to invest in what I know and what I’m comfortable with (SPY, Apple, Nvidia, QQQ, and some other ETF’s in industrials and retail). Over the past year I’m up 23%, but I’d like to be a savvier trader and see if I can maximize my gains further with shorter holding periods. 

I’m currently learning more about algorithmic investing and I want to understand and gain ideas from others experiences. Has anyone here been successful developing their own algorithmic trading models to initiate trades? Or do you prefer to use third party resources? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hh36fg/how_have_you_utilized_algorithmic_investing_for/,17,2024-12-18 15:49:52,"I too want to make a lot of money in a short period of time. Let me know when you find the stock trading version of the Anti-Life Equation.; You are not going to be making money with algorithmic trading as an individual (or at least, it would be extremely rare). You will be competing with huge quant firms and with the top of the top of mathematicians, software engineers, etc.

As an individual I will focus on following index and wait. If you want to invest in single stocks, I would go with Value investing or other alternatives in the mid-long term.; Only the WSB algorithm. Which is derived from ""line only goes up"" your results may vary.; Wall Street spent (IIRC) billions of dollars laying a fiber-optic cable from New York to London that did nothing except shave a grand total of five milliseconds off the time it took for information to travel across the Atlantic.

No retail investor can hope to compete with that kind of capital investment or the math wizards coming up with the behind-the-scenes equations making it all work.; OP found the Akashic Records which supposedly gives one the ultimate power of buying low and selling high!; I’m all about simplifying things with a solid plan. Algorithmic investing can definitely help you level up, but it’s crucial to understand the strategy behind it before jumping in. I stick with strategies that align with my goals—options, dividends, and the like—while keeping my risk in check. If you’re diving into algo trading, start small and make sure you really understand how those models are built and the data they use. Don’t let the tech overwhelm you.; It's probably better to wait for good opportunities to buy a stock than to build some algorithm up from 0. Algorithms also tend to overreact, giving retail investors some good opportunities. 

A lot about the stock market is about psychology after all.; Bit of a newbie...
What defines algorithm trading? 
And where does one learn? 

I had been a buy and hold on dividend stocks, on non-divedend stocks -  take a profit on half the shares if it moves over 40% and maybe acquire more.

Now I've started covered calls instead of just selling for profit - get a premium and maybe profit,  or premium and keep it...

Debating selling puts on stuff I hold at even ir loss IF I think it's coming back (INTC & DOW maybe? ); I am a simple man.

I do 50/50 VTSAX/VGT; In the past I have worked as an algo trading developer in a hedge fund and now I have developed my own models for forex trading. I prefer interactive trading for stock market.

BTW: I'm not making millions out of it. You need to already have millions in order to make millions ;); Isn't this the one area of trading/investing that individuals are least able to compete in? Tons of huge companies spend million on getting the most data, training the largest models, running it the fastest, and placing the trades earlier than anyone else.

If I had to guess there are more opportunities to be found in super long term investing since fewer people seem to be optimizing it, rather than in super short term trades.; I haven't and will never. Stupid. ; Op is getting 23% returns and wants more? LOL; Not to mention huge amounts of compute to train their proprietary models. 

You can use their algorithms to work in your favor though. More algorithms, means more volatility,  means more violent dips and overreactions. More retail investors, means more algorithmic sentiment contagion, means even larger unjustified dips. 

Even in this hyper-bull market their are a good amount of stocks with strong fundamentals at a good price.; You could buy an algo ETF and then you'd make however much % that large quant firm makes; [deleted]; Same thing in Denmark by the way. One of the biggest investment firms paid to have a private cable running from them to the national stock exchange, just to get a few milliseconds faster data, just so they could outbid/outsell others by a fraction of a second.
Not surprised at all that this is (apparently) a common thing.; Even then, they're no better off; SPY is up like 28% y/y, so he'd have been better off indexing.; He is losing to the market and now wants to make an algorithm that will also lose to the market; But do you really need an algorithm for that? I mean, it does make data collection easier I guess, but as you said you still go through each one and analyzie the fundamentals.; “Find the bottom of good companies” like Apple and Tesla?

Am I missing something here?; Yep. Seems crazy to me that people want returns higher than SPY when cash in a HYSA gives you less than 5%.; LOLOLOL; [deleted]; [deleted]; Yeah fair, using algorithms as data collection/filtering tool sounds like a good base. I was thinking about creating something similar but more for news etc, to do some gambling on ""events"" (and their aftermath). Different strategy though.; This just sounds like you’re regurgitating quotes from warren buffett. “Find good companies”. 

Long term, Tesla is just a highly volatile stock, it’ll drop from this peak as it did in 2022. Survivor bias. I’ll bet you’ve lost just as much on stocks that didn’t pan out.; You could probably build an NLP model that could ""read"" the news of each companies in stock exchange, rank them based on the market sentiment, financial datas like P/E ratio, debt to equity, and whatnot. Long on the companies with the highest positive sentiment, and short with the highest negative sentiment; [deleted]; 3500 shares at todays share price is $1.7m.

Even with a 3:1 stock split, that’s less than $4m; [deleted]; You sound really odd tbh. Remember something someone commented on Reddit until you die? Wtf lol

There’s only been two stock splits but for your fiend to have bought at $200 it can only have been after the second stock split which was only 3:1.

For then to have got the first stock split which was 5:1 they would have had to purchase below $140 which was the top price when the first 5:1 split happened.

In simple terms, it’s physically impossible for you or your friend to have got in at $200 and been through both splits.

At best you’ve got all you’re numbers wrong and at worst you’re fabricating a story."
86,NVIDIA's Recent Decline and Opportunities for a New Rally,"NVIDIA fell nearly 4% today before narrowing the loss to 1.22%. Since hitting a record closing high of $148.88 in early November, the AI chip maker's stock has dropped over 10%.

So, what is causing NVIDIA's decline?

**1. Supply Chain Issues and Challenges**

NVIDIA faces multiple challenges in its supply chain, a significant factor in its stock decline.

First, according to the latest data, the order volume and schedules for the GB200 and GB300 have been adjusted. Particularly, the mass production and shipment of GB series products have been postponed until after the Lunar New Year in February, increasing market uncertainty. Additionally, the small-scale production plans for GB300 face tight deadlines, putting pressure on GB200's mass production.

https://preview.redd.it/scpz7bjoak7e1.jpg?width=620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c84a2bd55783d7b6efd0bfff35d9d3c4a3db74bb

Specific supply chain issues include CoWoS-L packaging technology, heating problems, copper cable connections, and leakage issues. These not only affect product yield rates but also increase system integration time costs. Consequently, NVIDIA has suggested customers purchase the B200 8-card HGX as a transitional solution, and clients like Microsoft are considering switching their orders. These supply chain issues affect NVIDIA's product delivery capabilities and reduce market expectations for its future performance.

**2. Market Competition and Narrative Changes**

ASICs are gaining market recognition as a competitive narrative.

ASICs are chips designed for specific tasks, akin to custom running shoes for a race. For certain tasks, ASICs outperform NVIDIA's GPUs (widely used for computing tasks) and are potentially cheaper.

OpenAI co-founder Ilya and industry leaders like Microsoft's CEO Satya have started discussing the importance of not only training AI models but also ensuring they can quickly and accurately make decisions in real applications. This shift in perspective gives ASICs an advantage in some scenarios, as they are designed for rapid, precise execution of tasks.

This raises questions about the cost of NVIDIA's GPUs. While powerful, they are expensive and require significant electricity and cooling. As ASICs perform better at lower costs for some tasks, there's consideration of replacing NVIDIA's GPUs with ASICs.

Additionally, changes in scaling law narratives and the strengthening of inference narratives pose threats to NVIDIA.

Scaling laws suggest that increasing AI model size (e.g., more neurons or layers) typically improves performance, but these gains are not infinite and require significant computational resources. This means NVIDIA must continually invest resources to improve product performance, potentially increasing costs.

https://preview.redd.it/pjjpyc10bk7e1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=20d52e676ae3473e567bb43fb383864886de72cb

Moreover, companies like BTC, Tesla, and Google are investing heavily in their own AI chips or solutions. This intensifies market competition and challenges NVIDIA's leadership.

**3. Market Sentiment and Capital Flows**

Market sentiment and capital flow significantly impact NVIDIA's stock price. As the year ends, retail investors, ETFs, and institutions adjust their portfolios. Fluctuations in tech giants like Microsoft, Apple, and Google affect tech stocks like NVIDIA. Investors are more cautious, favoring stable, promising companies.

Given these conditions, NVIDIA faces pressure on its stock price due to supply chain issues and competition. Lowered expectations for NVIDIA's future performance lead to capital outflows and stock price declines.

  
**4. Future Outlook and Catalysts**

Despite current challenges, NVIDIA has opportunities for a turnaround.

First, NVIDIA needs to resolve supply chain issues, improve product yield, and delivery capabilities. Second, strengthening its presence in software and applications is crucial to addressing market competition. Additionally, NVIDIA should explore new computing narratives to expand its computing potential.

 **5. Technical Analysis and Price Divergence**

Previously, prices rose continuously, but volume and KDJ began to decline, showing divergence. Without capital support, upward momentum was insufficient, leading to a short-term adjustment and a break below the mid-term trend line, resulting in a mid-term adjustment.

When Might a New Rally Occur?

From a technical analysis perspective: After two prior mid-term adjustments, breaking the downward trend line may signal the start of a new rally. Thus, this new rally must first break the resistance line.

From a catalyst perspective: While January's CES and the earnings release in late February may not bring major surprises, March's GTC is worth anticipating. NVIDIA needs to showcase new technologies and products at this event to restore market confidence. If NVIDIA can introduce groundbreaking innovations, a stock rebound is possible.

88,History Will Repeat Itself: A Bear Scenario that Will Likely Happen ,"This is long so if you don’t want to or simply can’t read, just type a stock WSB response like “hurr durr stonks only go up” and move on.  If you have actual thoughts on what I’m saying or think I’m wrong, please share.  

To begin, we need to talk about what happened in 2018.  The market and Trump’s first administration were running smoothly.  Stonks only went up.  Then in 2018, they didn’t.  Why?  A few factors.  First, Trump introduced tariffs on aluminum, steel, and other goods to try to make American companies a more viable alternative to China(sound familiar?).   This essentially created a trade war with China, and led to China showing much slower economic growth than expected.  This led to a 500 point drop in the Dow on global recession fears.  

Later in the year, a newly appointed(by Trump) chairman of the Fed, Jerome Powell, had a conference in December.  By that point, the Fed had already hiked interest rates 4 times that year.  Powell stated at that conference that the Fed would likely slow rate hikes in 2019, but the market did not buy that and fears of a recession set in.  The Dow dropped 350 points soon after.  Trump made remarks about firing Powell after this debacle, but backed off.  There were other factors at play, such as the Schiller PE being 33.31(it is currently at 38.55), but those two factors were likely the biggest.  

One more important point:  Trump is obsessed with the stock market.  My favorite story on this topic comes from the Covid era.  On Friday, March 13,  Trump brought the CEO’s from a bunch of big players to the White House for a press conference.  He basically paraded them around, lauding how everything is going to be ok and Tim Apple is going to save us.  During this Friday afternoon circus, SPY ripped from 250 to 270 in an hour.  That night, Trump sent a signed copy of the chart from that day to Lou Dobbs to brag.   Then on the following Monday, we had another circuit breaker day as SPY tanked 11%.  

I tell you all this because history is going to repeat itself.  Trump has already touted 100% tariffs on fucking everything.  Whether he follows through with them, who knows.  He could just be using them as a threat to get leverage on trade deals.  But he has a precedent of using them, so I believe he will follow through.  His goal is to bring manufacturing back to the US, which is all well and good.  Jobs are good.  But one thing about manufacturing here as opposed to, say, India, is we aren’t going to be ok with being paid $1.38 a day.  The cost in labor to produce here is not nearly as appealing as producing in Vietnam, Bangladesh, or any other country that uses what is essentially slave labor with zero worker protections and zero environmental regulations.  Additionally, it will take years for any company that does choose to manufacture here to get up and running, and who knows what the political environment will look like once Trump is gone.  

We are also set up for another war between Trump and Powell.  This one WILL 100% happen.  Although it came in as expected, the last CPI showed inflation increasing slightly after months of continuous decline.  The PPI, however, came in hotter than expected.  This is a huge problem.  The Fed will for sure cut tomorrow, and Powell will give his speech on using his tools and data and taking in information as it comes, but I promise you this cut is concerning for him.  They want that 2% target, and Trump’s hot economy is not going to let them get there.  The combination of Trump cutting every regulation and allowing companies to shit in our water supply, along with his 100% tariffs on some imports, WILL BRING INFLATION BACK.  If companies have to pay more to import the goods that they sell, they will pass those costs onto the consumer.  There is no other way about it.  I know his goal is to bring manufacturing back, but that will take a lot of time.  And in the meantime, equities will suffer as inflation rises, and the Fed is forced to embarrassingly increase rates again.  

What I’m interested to see is how the battle of Trump vs Powell plays out.  There have already been a few articles regarding Trump possibly firing Powell, to which he responded “I don’t think so”, but he’s a liar so I don’t believe that.  Trump simply wants to be surrounded by yes men.  That is why he had the highest turnover of any administration in US history.  Honestly I think it just gets his dick hard to fire people, especially given “you’re fired” was his trademark phrase from that stupid tv show.  Powell has said it is illegal for Trump to do so, and that he is not leaving under any circumstances.  Personally I think he hates Trump, and rightfully so.  

So this is my prediction.  Trump gets into office, and on day one announces regulation cuts and tariffs.  He gives tax breaks to companies that choose to bring jobs to the US, and so on.  He wants economic growth at any cost.  Markets react mixed because the tariffs are concerning.  We start to see inflation rise due to importing costs rising.  Then Powell and the Fed fight over raising rates to tame inflation, because higher rates = slower growth.  Where we go from there, I’m not sure.  If Trump does try to fire Powell and succeeds,  I think that will be an extremely concerning look.  Powell has done a fairly decent job of getting things under control, and has done a very good job of telegraphing the Fed’s next moves.  The market hates uncertainty, and he knows that.  Trump firing him and installing a yes man will be extremely detrimental imo.  

So what do you think?  Will history repeat itself? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hgqaex/history_will_repeat_itself_a_bear_scenario_that/,1304,2024-12-18 02:21:47,"

And I think a lot of people forget about Covid starting under his term, finishing under the current administration. And I think Covid masked the economic recession that we were already headed into. So I have been trying to decide what I want to do with some of my stocks because I feel we are headed for a spiraling decline.; Elon musk himself said that the economy was in for some pain once the new administration takes over. They are preparing for the economy to crash so the rich can swoop in and buy all the assets up.    If the guys on top are showing their gameplan in public, it's probably best to listen.; I agree with you. Everyone knows the market is frothy but the dip needs a catalyst. I think that catalyst will be the fed reacting to a resurgence of inflation for the reasons you state. Can't see it being every gay bears 80% dip dream though.; This is the buy signal I was waiting for. 🙏 internet stranger; # Conclusion:

You predict history will repeat: tariffs → inflation → Fed hikes → Trump vs. Powell drama → market volatility. The long-term effects of Trump’s policies will depend on how quickly domestic manufacturing picks up and how well the Fed manages inflation without crushing growth.

Your take: If Trump succeeds in firing Powell, it could spell trouble for market stability.; There’s a few valid points in here, but hurr durr stonks only go up.; https://preview.redd.it/jmfhf0d9zi7e1.jpeg?width=562&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a01cd65bf97665d2d919229898dccc196addf309

Time to bring this back out; Retaliatory tariffs are going to hurt like a kick in the dick. Because the US is an importer of everything, Canada’s proposed tariffs on exports, if copied by other countries like Mexico… have fun blowing your paycheck on tomatoes and lettuce at the grocery store and gas station.; OP, what exactly is your position? Are you shorting SPY or did you load up on puts expiring Feb?; You forgot about the impact that the mass deportations will have on the economy, but in general yeah I think you are on to something. In regards to the deportations, just watch GEO stock,  if that starts to sell off then the market thinks it was a bluff and will be a non-issue.; The last sentence I agree with - if Trump fires Powell (who - people forget that he himself nominated) then the markets will get rocky because he is unilaterally admired and accepted by both sides of the politely isle. He is perhaps one of the last high profile nonpartisan figures we can count on to complete his mission devoid of politics. I think his legacy will be remembered fondly and he’s done a great job.; I agree with this. Too many average people think that the stock market is only going to go up after the inauguration. That on its own is my signal to get more conservative on top of other concerns with tariffs and general mismanagement from the WH over the next 4yrs.; Ok but when ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258); good commentary from original poster.

Plus the added stimulus China is pumping into the economy might be too little too late sort of deal.; Inflation goes up, stocks go up 📈; This was a hell of a DD. I agree with you on pretty much your whole assessment. I could see everything you mentioned coming to pass. It’s a shame that the majority of Americans either don’t or choose not to see the reality of what’s coming. Thank you for your opinion and contribution.; Can you narrate this to me?  I can't read; After OP posts all that, I think it's now 100% priced-in. SPY to 700$ tomorrow! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787); TL:DR 🌈 🐻 post!; I think you’re broadly correct, but trump is also owned by billionaires who don’t want their stock to go down. So even though the ‘actual’ economy will likely get significantly worse, i would expect the oligarchic overlords to somehow keep stock prices high… unless they start suddenly dumping stocks.

It’s really hard to say because the stock market isn’t a very good indicator of the economy anymore, but rather something that follows what people think/feel- as an example, macys has relatively stronger fundamentals than etsy….. but is perpetually lower priced due to opinions and how people think etsy as a market place will do better for whatever reason.; Is it me, or is everyone and their uncle trying to get you to short.; What is your response to an argument that Trump's prioritization of market growth would moderate his more extreme impulses with regards to tariffs and the extreme case of firing Powell; The Fed wants inflation at 2%. It's currently running at 2.75%. Median forecast for core inflation in the coming year: is 2.5%.

Forecasts for CPI effects of one possible tariff scenario (60% for imports from China, 20% for everywhere else): additional 0.5 to 1.5% on to of current numbers (i.e. CPI of 3% to 4.0%).

The Fed will raise interest rates again given the climbing inflation rate, which will again drive down stonks. 

Trump V2 will be no better than Trump V1.

1. He intends to use tariffs, but likely in a more limited setting and not anything crazy like 100%.

2. He keeps talking about it now so the stock market will keep going down now, instead of going down after he presumes office. Market is kinda slowing down right now pricing in crazy tariffs and his simple calculation is that when he announces tariffs and the markets see that it's not as crazy as he talks now, market will go up. 


He really cares about the stock market going up during his term so he's doing his best to tank it right now and put it all on Biden lol.; blah blah blah, SPY 700, Eat shit; It's not about bringing back manufacturing to the USA. It's about raising money to be able to justify( massive tax cuts to the wealthy (and corporations) again. That's also the purpose of DOGE.; Look, everyone knows what you say is likely true. But no one gives a shit. If anyone gave a shit about logic, we wouldn’t be here in this situation right now in the first place. 

Buckle up - if you haven’t lost your sanity yet, you will. The mod can remain irrational longer than you can remain sane; Tldr buy the dip easy; Never forget- Trump had a board game called ""I'm back and You're Fired""; Let me get some extra honey mustard; Money printer go brrrrr if the market collapse happens. Money printer go brrrrr if the market keeps going up it’s a win win. It’s a mental game and I’m happy to get a good buy in on some stocks bears still lose.

Calls on money printer; ""Powell has done a fairly decent job at getting things under control""


Let's inflation run rampant for multiple years saying that it's transitory, before timidly reacting ; You have a generous review Powell’s performance. The Fed said they weren’t even thinking about thinking about raising rates which induce the banks to take on duration risk. Then he tried to bullshit us about transitory inflation for how long? Then when he had to take the Punchbowl away, all the banks were upside down on duration. He damn near caused the a banking crisis.  But to be fair, the inflation was fiscally driven not monetary. He was just trying to throw water on the fire that the Congress and president had  lit.   

I hope I am right in saying that the tariffs are mostly posturing. I’m sure there will be some tariffs, but I don’t think they are going to be extreme as Trump is advertising. Hell the threat of Canadian tariffs… Trudeau is about to resign.; I see stoopid bers are still not extinct here yet, more room to go![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267); Shiller PE is for Econ majors who haven’t looked at the market in their life; Well said; I remember when Trump was crying for negative rates too. He's clueless but somehow convinced people he's good for the economy; Bullish on this dumb bear; 5 months of up followed by the greatest reversal in modern times.; Man I hope you had puts and made money. You deserve it; Should have taken this post seriously lmao. Stocks are in free fall.; A lot of thoughts here and a lot of things have to happen.  I agree that tariffs are bad for the consumer. And I agree Trump is very short sighted. Not a good combo for growth and leadership.  If your scenario happens, it will be a stock pickers market.; Okay, hear me out: priced in; I agree this all sounds plausible!! I wrote a post asking if a hedge on the VXX is a good idea mid to Jan for a couple months as I think thing are going to go bonkers and not in a good way.

Your thesis backs my idea and almost certain I will do it; hurr durr stonks only go up; Note that Jerome Powell's current term as chair ends in May 2026, and he plans to serve his entire second term. Based on [section 10 of the Federal Reserve Act](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section10.htm) , he is likely only removable for cause.; Trump raises tariffs. Inflation rises. Powell raises interest rates. Trump fires Powell. Biggest market crash in history.  Capital flees North America for Asia and the EU.; Stonks only go up confirmed.; Stoniks only go up!; https://preview.redd.it/y3e660gi3j7e1.jpeg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ac4ca80525c0a20fb6c6fe7ed3f81fbf7cc86e41; Absolutely loving all these bearish posts lately I was starting to get worried the top was in.; Priced in; DJT’s first term actually went better than expected and probably shouldn’t have based on all of the really dumb BS that fell out of his uuuuuge pie-hole. And he hasn’t said much so far other than “tariffs” but I feel it’s just enough that this time, he’s going to do some real damage. 

Maybe the time to sell-off is before the inauguration and see what happens in that first 100 days of office. 

I have zero idea obviously but we’ll see as that time comes how the markets are reacting. Right now they are pretty frothy.; You got one thing right Powell is gonna be regarded and cut the rates again tomorrow then stonks are gonna rip![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276); Bro really calling bear since 2021….; I was also gay for like 5 seconds; Good read. Good points that I will keep in mind. But for now, stonks only go up ! Hurr durr !; It should be noted, that this time they came with a plan, not just to frolick around and see what happens. In their communication, deficit reduction was a prime theme, so I would guess they will make an attempt at austerity measures. Medicare and Medicaid will be gutted. I would guess inflation can be tamed this way, imploding standards of living will just decrease demand for everything. But the mother of all recessions will be triggered by the falling demand for everything.; You lost me when you started talking about pooping in water.; My guy, I’m not reading all of that.

Can you give us a TL;DR?; Thank you for writing this, so that I didn’t have to. I also think you were generous in not including the many other factors I see such as mass exporting of the work force, incompetent heads of critical departments, wasting time and money on retribution and so on. I will not be in the market when Trump takes office.; The problem with FED rising rates is it makes paying the interest on the debt even more difficult, if not impossible. Note that I'm not even talking about actually paying off at least a big chunk of that debt.

  
The way out of it is DOGE efficiency actually being succesful combined with massive economic growth, 4-5% for years on end without increasing government spending at the same time. That's not gonna happen. Don't forget that in two years there are midterm elections where Trump will likely lose his majority. Happens often to sitting presidents.

  
The flipside to this argument is that Biden didn't lower Trumps previous tarrifs either and in some cases doubled down on them and that this didnt stop the economy from growing reasonably bigly. Not for everyone, I know, but as a whole it did. Also, Chyna is asshoe. The US does not need to accept being buttfucked by Beijing.; That’s a lot to unpack and I agree with you, although I do not hate trump and see his goal. I absolutely agree with the fact that what he will do will cause a crash, to what degree who knows. Another thing that needs to be looked at is how many of these people on Wall Street and within our government hate trump. I think it’s going to be a culmination of his policies that hit us and everyone’s retaliation against him that will make it the blood bath that it will be. I think at the very least we will see a pretty gnarly dip and if there is a recovery the markets will be almost un-tradable volatility for poor bastards like me in the futures market.; There’s a lot of cash on the sidelines waiting for a correction.  In my mind, this kind of keeps a floor on how bad things could get.  Unless there is some black swan event, I think stocks could kind of move sideways with an upward trajectory over longer periods.; Trump does not have the authority to fire Powell.  Full stop.; I think we’ll have a correction similar to first quarter of 2022. Probably 4th qtr of 2025 through 1st qtr of 2026; Why would tariffs not be priced into the markets already?; Hurr durr stonks only go up; ChatGPT:

Here’s a concise summary of the post:

The user outlines parallels between market dynamics during Trump’s first administration and what might happen if he’s re-elected. They focus on three key points:

1. **Historical Context (2018 and COVID era):**
   * In 2018, tariffs initiated a trade war with China, contributing to market drops and fears of recession. Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s rate hikes added to the tension, prompting speculation Trump wanted to fire him.
   * During COVID, Trump’s market obsession was exemplified by orchestrating a brief rally, followed by further losses.
2. **Predictions for a Future Trump Administration:**
   * Tariffs and deregulation could fuel inflation as increased import costs pass to consumers.
   * Manufacturing shifts to the U.S. will take time and face challenges due to higher labor costs.
   * Trump and Powell are set for another clash, with potential Fed rate hikes to control inflation at odds with Trump’s growth-at-any-cost strategy.
3. **Potential Market Impact:**
   * Inflation may rise due to tariffs and deregulation.
   * Equities could suffer from higher rates and rising costs.
   * Trump firing Powell would create uncertainty and harm market stability.

The post concludes by questioning whether history will repeat itself, emphasizing the risks of Trump’s economic policies and conflicts with the Fed.; "" The combination of Trump cutting every regulation and allowing companies to shit in our water supply, along with his 100% tariffs on some imports, WILL BRING INFLATION BACK.""


Please explain how cutting regulations increases inflation? Cutting regulations decreases compliance cost which makes goods cheaper not more expensive to produce.; I’m not reading all that+you’re wrong+you’re 🌈; You didn’t mention energy costs. Big part of inflation.
Trump will be all in on energy production and bringing energy costs down. 

To be seen.; OP, have you sold out of all your positions?; TL:DR - stonks only go up. 

Everyone keeps moaning about Trump tariffs while they pretend Biden didn't keep Trump's original ones in place and then fucking add to them.

Biden had tariffs too you fucking clowns. No, not just ""targeted"" tariffs which is what you love to hide behind and justify his, calling those ""targeted"" but every other tariff under the sun from the other side are blanketed ones.

Yours are always different somehow. They actually aren't.

Trump has already spoken with the leaders of Canada and Mexico who each came out after the meetings saying they have no fears of trade wars. He fucking invited Xi to the inauguration for crying out loud.

We START to see a rise in inflation? Did you not just see the last inflation report with inflation already back on the rise without Trump even being in office yet? You're just going to blame every single rise on Trump from this point and again he's not even in fucking office yet.

Here's my prediction - Libs will always find a way to bend and twist any narrative they can into being one that is disparaging towards Trump regardless of how true or real it is. They'll spin every fantasy they can telling us how Trump is about to bring the end of the world, again, and crash our economy so bad we end up a third world nation.

But -- what will actually happen are some bumps in the road on our way to new all time highs under his admin. Then we'll get a new president and the same shit will happen. And another, and another, and another.; Something’s brewing in the market but you’re just a whiner. Stocks go up; probably, in fact I betting long that spy or tsla or even nvda gonna shit the bed big time due to the big T tomfoolery.

It is good to be reminded of these considerations.; Yes we’ve all seen that triangle chart from Benner; legit amazing when he signed a copy of the daily SPY chart. legend.; Basically when he starts singing his tariff bills market will tank. Until then it’s gravy train baby; The market is going to tank because we are in an AI generated, Fed lowering rates to early, extremely high valuation market bubble. Warren Buffett was asked what he would buy and he said “Nothing!” The time you need to worry is when the Bears capitulate or there’s no Bears period like right now!

Calls it is; Inflation inflates asset values. Stonks are assets.; I agree it will happen, but when? You cite 2018, that’s two years into the last term. Do we crash in January? Or do we have a 20% correction after a 30% gain in 2025?; Not permitted under law. Powell’s good.

Billionaires paid to get him in office. They will use him to grow their companies astronomically. Bullish.; No TLDR? Go fuck yourselfemote:t5\_2th52:27421; Scott Bessent is a pro. Tariffs are a one time price level adjustment. 3% inflation is OK for Fed, helps inflate away debt. QT could stop. Rest of world is in an easing cycle, dollar can only be so strong before it becomes a vortex of liquidity. Back to TINA. 

So sure there could be a sharp sell off, but 6.5 trillion in money markets, even 1% buying the dip that line is going up and to the right 📈; So, buy more? Got it.; Pull back, yeah. Crash, lol.; Who the fuck double spaces their sentences this hard; Do billionaires and the 1% want the market to crash? There's your answer. If they don't it won't. If they all go short somehow then a crash is plausible.; If history repeats itself we’ll be buying puts after the government announces unlimited fiscal stimulus.; Employees are going to be footing the bill for the inflation too. Don’t expect incomes to rise to retain the current spending habits. Maybe a few will be able to do the same business with lower overhead, but not enough to offset the total losses. This is going to be not great for the average American family.; !remindme 4 months; Dude puts bread in the oven and asks us all to watch it bake.; Isn’t Powell retiring in 2025?; Actually it's going to be worse! For every Republican president in their second term, the markets rallied the first 2 years only to cause huge crashes and recessions for the last 2 years. In Trump's case, he may only get a year if the federal reserve cuts 3 times next year like I think 🤔 they will. This means the second year will be down and so will the third and fourth; You’re right, OP. Stonks probably will tank. The problem is it’s gonna be really hard to guess exactly when. Do you pull all your money from Tempe market now? Do you actively bet the market will tank with puts/ shorts? Do you just let it ride?; OP isn't wrong - idk how anyone doesn't see this is what's coming. In what timeframe does this all start to become more apparent is what I'm concerned with.; Anytime I see the gov’t wants to ban congress from stock trading the market goes down.; We literally just started cutting rates; My question is how are his voters gonna defend this chaos?; This is valuable but centered around speculations on politic/s and FED movements. While I am writing this, the AI moderator says this post might get banned…

So three keywords: Tariff, inflation and rates. Even the projections are perfectly accurate, to what degree the market will respond? This is the real question. It won’t be a doomsday scenario I wish.; I’m worried about the debt wall coming up where a shitload of bonds and loans need refinancing; Our collective memory is getting shorter and technology is making it easier to gamble. Not a great combo.; Apparently the Swiss are concerned about DEFLATION and their central bank just cut 50 bps and threatened to go below zero. What a ride if he catches the bug and cuts 50.; I mean yeah we'll see some volatility, but we're still going to be generally heading up over the next 4 yrs unless something catastrophic happens. Pretty dumb to be a bear as some idiot day/short term trader, in which ~99% of you will lose trading like this over the long term.

Now how do I get that 🐻 and noose pic?; I'm guessing you're not a fan of the incoming prez lol; Imma say this.... The day for the bulls to wear diapers is approaching .....The market only go up until  ""Sike""..... Stay tune for next episode of market only go up

![img](emote|t5_2th52|31226)![img](emote|t5_2th52|31226); [removed]; Counterpoint: everything trump said on the campaign trail is bullshit and the only thing he cares about is keeping the stock market hot, because DJT can only go up in a bull market since it is a garbage company; I'm with you.  Plan on selling everything in the first week of January.  I think 2025 is going to suck big time.; Trump does not have the ability to fire Powell.; Does no one here, you know.... just use stop losses?; Nicely put; No idea and no one does. When I am telling my wife how well everything is looking, I have found that is the top, that’s about now come to think of it; I’m most worried about the financial deregulation; Inflation doesn’t affect nor bother the riches, it s an opportunity for them to invest in companies that would beat the tariffs then dump it after 4 years 

Rates do not really counter tariffs inflation, and here s why people think they impact currency (omg I want more interest for my money…) but the goal here is to massively suck out the neighbours dependency, then open borders in 4 years, devaluate, dump, repeat; I mean you’re probably right, but this is quite short term; Thanks for the paragraphs. Positions or ban; Is this why some of my holdings are hitting 52 weeks lows?; Mathematically it can’t keep these high returns over the next few years and decade without a correction. 

Best case scenario 2025 is a stagnant year (or provides a very modest return) and S&P500 stays at $6000. 

But don’t listen to me, I’m buying whether it goes up or down. DCA all the way lol; Hate to break it to you but China knows they can’t fuck with Trump so they give in to most of his demands tariffs become a non issue. China market will be the trade next year; You just wrote a novel based on your personal opinion, hunches and a politician living rent free in your head.; You just took the time to write All of that. And the ask what do we think🤦‍♂️; hey I can't read all that. So i had Chat-GPT sum it up. Sounds like ChatGPT thinks you're a gay bear.

  
""  
Alright, let's condense this into a snappy TL;DR with some extra sass:

**TL;DR:**

Meet OP, our resident WallStreetBets doomsayer, who’s convinced they’ve cracked the code on the next financial meltdown. Armed with a keyboard and a flair for drama, they’re here to warn us about the Trump-Powell showdown sequel that nobody asked for.

1. **2018 Flashback:** OP thinks they’re the only one who remembers Trump’s tariff tantrum and Powell’s rate hikes, like they’ve uncovered some secret stock market prophecy.
2. **Trump’s CEO Circus:** OP spins a tale of Trump’s COVID-era CEO parade, complete with a signed stock chart for Lou Dobbs, because why not add a touch of absurdity?
3. **Doomsday Prediction:** OP predicts tariffs will skyrocket inflation, and Powell will have to save the day by raising rates. It’s a classic “sky is falling” scenario, brought to you by someone who thinks they’re the next economic oracle.
4. **The Grand Finale:** OP warns that if Trump fires Powell, we’re all doomed. Apparently, only OP can see the impending chaos, and they’re hoping we’re all as panicked as they are.

**Conclusion:**

In short, OP’s got their popcorn ready for the financial apocalypse they’re sure is coming. Whether it’s a fever dream or a genuine prediction, they’re here for the drama.

signed- hurr durr stonks only go up; I think a correction and consolidation is definitely in order. We need to see much higher earnings for these multiples to even make any sense remotely. Any major movement on tariffs will definitely spook the market which will easily cause a 10-15% correction. On top of that if earnings come in weaker than expected the tariff news will cause a deeper downturn.; Go ahead and short the market. You won’t; I’m still trying to figure out where all these magical workers will come from to work in US factories. Especially after deporting all the migrants. I guess we must be banking on the Tesla bot to do it all.; Honestly, not too worried about next four years in terms of inflation. Sure, you’re probably right that it will go up, but what I am most worried about is the labor shortage that will be def be accelerated by 🥭. The next 6-12 months, or even 4 years, will be nothing compared to what is to come post 🥭. 

I know this is not /geopolitics but 🥭 and any other prez are simply agents of whatever American society wants. American society does not want their equities to tank, so it won’t happen. American society does not want people not having jobs, so it won’t happen. American society does not like black swan events, so it will turn to government to fix it as quickly as possible.; Not American, but I also thought about this recently. At least this time I am better prepared to make some money off of his administration.; I 100% agree with you. These are the factors that could derail the markets. People forget how it was the first time around with his 2AM tweets and his tendency to fire people on the spot that didn’t do his bidding (Comey, Sessions, Rex Tillerson) so many more got fired by tweet.

Then he will try to spin the narrative of the tariffs at every opportunity. Even if the stock market tanks and tanks he will say: “sleep J left this for us. Or thigs will get better. Or you’re not telling the full story, good American companies are thriving it’s the bad ones that are hit by the tariffs, FAKE NEWS”

Musk is as unhinged. I’m deeply worried what his agenda is. Make no mistakes if, he could wipe out the Mag6 and keep Tesla on top he would! He hates his competition personally.; Stonks up; Just look at my brokerage account and I'm not even a gay bear but I buy puts itm and get wrecked; Buy the dip guys. It’s only up from then on 🚀. We getting rich rahhhhh; No I Don’t think history will repeat itself. This is a different time period from last term. Trump easily won the election this time and instead of him trying to win over big tech CEO’s, now they are all kissing his ass. Trump is walking into a strong economy, low unemployment, record highs for the stock market and all other asset classes for that matter. Yes inflation is a bit sticky but has come down considerably and stabilized. 

With that being said, I don’t think he will want to rock the boat to much as not to derail this ongoing party. He has support of much of the corporate world and they all want to let the good times roll. I do think some policies will cause more market volatility and there will be some turbulence along the way but barring a black swan event, I see this bull market staying in tact. Policies will be implemented that promote economic growth which will improve earnings and help justify already elevated valuations. 

My prediction: bull market will continue through his term and then market will crash towards the end of his term and it will be the next man/woman’s job to “Make America Great Again”; hurr durr stonks only go up; Bullish. Let err rip!; TLDR stonks only go up hurrdurrr; We’re not even in the bull market yet; Yeah, but not today!; from 09 to 23 the only 1 negative spy year together with covid 22 anomaly, oh no anyway; In my recollection this isn’t totally correct. 2017 you had an enormous amount of speculation in stocks as well as inverse volatility products like XIV and people shorting VXX and UVXY. In early 2018 that trade blew up. Later in the year Powell made a policy error and said “we’re a long way from neutral” implying that the Fed was going to be hiking several times.

That was a policy error because he assumed the market was on board with it. He later reversed that policy but tax loss harvesting caused a major selloff at the end of the year.

In 2019 the market bounced back but this is when trump’s rhetoric on tariffs began to really heat up. So the market acted like it wanted to go up but due to random tweets the market was very volatile and kept in check. Finally around October of 2019 the market finally broke out. I remember pretty well Apple breaking out of a range first and lots of people calling it crazy. That culminated in a short lived speculative boom into the COVID crash. Who remembers luckin coffee? That was a speculative favorite of the day. Virgin galactic was another.

Anyway, Covid happened which both caused a crash but also began an era of insane liquidity and inflation. The inflation led to a fed policy change which resulted in the bear market in 2022. But then the Fed reversed again and the market seems to have been feeding off of that ever since. In retrospect in 23 you had lots of bearish expectations not just because of rates but also because many expected inflation to persist longer than it did. Once it became evident it was trending lower the market took flight.

Now don’t get me wrong, I’m more surprised than anyone how much the market has risen on seemingly very little fundamental news. I have been very bearish on AI for instance because it seems like a huge misallocation of capital. But I attribute the market’s rise to a couple of phenomenon.

First the general access to markets via free instant trading and 24/7 real time quotes.

Second, there has been a major shift in views on cash. People just seem to be very risk on and not interested in saving given that the Fed continues to imply rates will continue lower.

Third, regarding the speculative froth that’s taken off recently, I think the part few speculative bubbles we’ve had going back to 2017 have trained people to buy into story stocks.

I believe what’s happened recently where the market has taken off despite lackluster job and economic growth is mostly attributable to a huge wealth effect for consumers that I don’t hear too many talk about. You have loads of people whose homes have 2-3xd in value combined with their mortgage rates/payments not going up with inflation combined with rising retirement accounts. In other words people’s wealth has gone up dramatically which has caused a more reckless attitude towards risk and more willingness to spend money. A third factor is that the US has produced more oil in the past couple years than the next two nations combined. It’s unprecedented. So that’s a massive tailwind to disinflation as well as consumer sentiment. We are basically all in on doing whatever we can to pump sentiment.

Obviously this can’t last forever. And what makes the situation very dangerous in my opinion is that so much of what’s happening is simply based on attitudes. “I feel rich today so I’ll spend.” Well that can change quickly and if the stock market drops for an extended period suddenly people will want to save. Plus the Fed has no policy tools to fight a recession and we’re already at low rates and low oil prices.

I think the most bearish thing though in the near term (that’s foreseeable) is that the Fed is likely nearing the end of the road in how far it can move rates. Without any more catalysts and everyone all in I’m not sure where there is to go.; If I keep posting bear fanfic every week, eventually I’ll be right!; Joe Biden just added the most tariffs to China in September, no one talks about it.Trump says use tariffs to negotiate and only on good we already make here and everyone yaps; So puts on AVGO? I’m confused; “Essentially slave labor with zero worker protections and zero environmental regulations”

Now you’re starting to get it.; Remindme! 3 months; Hey there bud, what about cuts to government spending? How inflationary is that?; I think you’re right that things will be extremely choppy, with swings up and down based on weird comments and tweets and whatnot.  

For example, over the summer we Trump made a comment about Taiwan defending themselves (something to that effect), and we saw a quick pullback in semiconductor stocks.; Housing was the biggest inflation contributor. As long as he can get that down, inflation won't tick back up. Most of the USA inflation was caused by internal factors rather than external (imported goods). i.e. energy, housing, food at home; Let’s not kid ourselves. Inflation is coming back with Trump. If people think otherwise, they are naive. 

What markets end up doing? I don’t know. Why? Because inflation means higher asset prices but inflation is also destructive and as you pointed out, could violently correct, especially if investors want to leave the US.; Jokes on you! All of my stocks have already crashed!; Did ChatGPT write this?; Too many words no positions me don’t understand; What makes anyone think manufacturing will bounce back, except for some niche industries that 100% require manufacturing in-house? You have an example in Brazil. Brazil makes a bunch of stuff for their internal market and tariffs the shit out of mostly everything else. So buying tertiary goods like tech, for example, is fucking expensive. Prohibitively so for the average middle 

Dell, for example, assembles consumer laptops in Brazil. It's a mess, RMA requests require the laptop to return to the factory to be destroyed and remade, among other very unfriendly processes to both the environment and the customer. So now laptops are being made in Brazil, sold in Brazil, at import tariff prices anyway. All for what? For a circular economy resembling former communist countries, which would manufacture, report, dismantle, manufacture the same products again and again for the sake of artificial productivity.

Great, it keeps jobs and plants functioning, terrific. It's sad to see huge manufacturing plants abandoned I won't lie, I've seen a few and it's a feeling I can't describe, seeing a dead town. But once those plants were introduced and exposed to the global market, even if they were lucky to survive oligarchs dismantling them for pennies, they withered and died, because their product was inefficient and sucked.

This isn't a 1-1 to the American case because imo the internal market is just such a rabid hyper capitalistic monster that it's too big to fail completely. But as a firm believer of the invest in America, live in Europe mantra, it does worry me to see the global market going to shit for some straight up shitty economic practice.

What do you think will happen to the stock market when the average online casino market gambler degenerate doesn't have money lying around to go all in on $AMD?; IF 

A = IF Trump gets into the white House.
Today Biden is still the president.

B= IF Trump is a complete idiot

C= IF Biden continues to expand the wars he created.

Let's not assume or take for granted anything until after January 20 th.; Tariffs existed forever. Media just make a big thing about it when Trump is in power. Europe just slapped tariffs on chinese EV cars. It is also not Trump who started a trade war, China created a trade war from the very beginning, devaluating their currency and not having a free market themselves. I swear, left wing people are stupid as hell, totally fed with the MSNBC propaganda bs.
You have to fix the trade deficit if you want to fix the money supply issue. They are connected. And as long as china plays unfair, tariffs are the way to go. How else would you pay for all your imports without exporting other than printing money? But hey, keep believing all those idiots in the MSM. ; Can someone give me summary of this long as text plsssss; I'll just wait for the S&P 500 rugpull moment, when the last-batch-boomers want their yachts and sell EVERYTHING.; #I’m not reading all this shit; TLDR; Seems like a good time to buy, and I can't beleive I'm saying this.. Gold.; I'm more impressed that a Redditor was able to only mention Trumps name exactly 20 times in a post this long. I figured I would have seen it atleast 21 times.; That’s a lot of text that I didn’t read, but I’m sure it makes sense. Well done.; hurr durr Stonks only go up; With tariffs you will see a fissure in the market. Mega caps will survive w minor hiccups. Small biz will get hit hardest. 

Plus certain industries will crater! Tech will stay strong but textiles and corn will take a dive. Soybeans too since we export so damn much soybeans that if we inflict tariffs then others will retaliate.

Energy exports to Europe are a wildcard. Europe and especially Germany still hold a diplomatic candle for Russia. They refuse as a bloc to be truly energy independent. US exports we can jack up the price at our leisure for gainz. Europe may retaliate by allowing China in for electric cars in a tit for tat as US tariffs hit; 🐻🌈🐻🏳️‍🌈🐻🌈; History doesn’t repeat itself but it often rhymes.; so reccession was trumps fault?; Is the crash in the room with us now?; Remember, it needs to have a reason to dump but not when its going up; Sure yea maybe eventually but the question is when… that is why timing things is almost impossible; So buy leap spy puts and become billionaire; hurr durr stonks only go up; Powell should be in jail along with Trump.

But especially Powell. 

Can’t get rid of that evil lizard fast enough; Calls;  O; The crash likely begins in January. Market momentum is already slowing here but most are waiting until the new year to sell to defer capital gains taxes. The same thing happened in 2021. After two years of huge gains, market peaked jan 2nd and was down most of 2022, -27% by October. This time it'll likely be worse as valuations are even higher to start. I'm expecting a -40% and this time bottom not reached until late 2026. Then we can finally start the next bear market from an actual fairly valued point, historically speaking; This idea that the economy is going to tank while the boomers are still alive is hilarious.

Until the boomers are gone, this economy is perma bull. You really think the generation who has luckboxed everything is gonna get a bad break? Lol ya right. Their portfolios are going to 10x before the market crashes, then when they are all gone, thats when the hammer is going to swing.; The funny thing is that this is a intelligent on point analysis and you can't make that on a Bull case but yet here we are. 2025 will be interesting to say the least.; It all about the Russell, if that goes bear, it all goes bear; Interesting breakdown...Trump vs. Powell round two seems inevitable if tariffs and inflation spike. Markets could get rocky if the Fed feels pressured to overcorrect again.; Trump will give a liquidity pump to kick the can past his presidency; Already priced in bro; He won’t fire JPow - he’ll just name his successor a year early and then everyone will pay attention to him instead.; I like how you wrote all that but didnt mention war

Thats the only risk i see; Didn’t ask Liberal; You had such an opportunity to title this
""History Bears Repeating"". I'm so disappointed in you.; If he gets yesmen in the Fed we're going to see interest rates at .05% and the next administration is going to have to start printing $1M notes like we're fucking Zimbabwe.; It is called a business CYCLE. Businesses expand, businesses contract. Stocks go up when there is growth; stocks go down when there is no growth or decline. Warren Buffet has been rotating to cash in anticipation of snapping up bargains when the market goes down.; Trump can’t fire Powell… (per a recent interview where Powell replies “no” to that very question.)

So…there’s that. 🤷🏽‍♂️; That's why puts were invented.; Tldr op missed the boat; How do bears find motivation? Like for 15 years, they have been wrong; I read it all. I am in line with this. Pending how this China north Korea Russia fiasco goes. I am waiting for what Trump does with tariffs. That will be the determining factor. A 10% correction in 25 is my bet for sure. Especially with how high we are going in a short period of time.; It’s true. It never happens.; Let us know when you buy - so we know the crash is here; You can buy cheap and it’ll still go down with that luck; Last several years since the great printer went brrr there's been to much cash out there to allow for a crash ; I am in the same boat as you! Waiting everyday for a drop to buy. SPY just wont drop below 600$.; This is exactly what I did and exactly what will happen; Bigly, you benefited bigly.; I went 50% cash, but still buy SPY weekly; LMFAO. Same!; 60% cash here. I'm jealous hahah. I think you may finally get your chance. OP's logic makes sense here.; I went 100% cash then bought back in 15%; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260); Honestly the joke is this is absolutely true 💯; TL;DR post, glad I skipped it all and got this summary.

The fact that Covid actually masked an impending recession and slowdown is definitely a provocative idea. idk if anyone has actually studied it because, likely, it would be almost impossible to discern how differently the world would have been ex-pandemic. But I think that I had forgotten this was actually an idea being floated back in 2020. Crazy that it’s been 5 years already.; Retaliatory tariffs are 100% going to be targeted at US soy, corn, pork, beef, steel, and anything Elon has or will touch.; So what you’re saying is, dry powder?; > So I have been trying to decide what I want to do with some of my stocks because I feel we are headed for a spiraling decline.

I’m waiting till the inauguration to see how serious Trump is about these tariffs. Tariffs will increase inflation which will increase interest rates, which will increase returns on bonds. So if Trump is a total loose cannon on tariffs, I’ll likely be shifting much of my money to bonds, until (if) Trump becomes more level headed.; I agree also. Extra points for posting something insightful to these mouth breathers.; Bird flu (up to 40% fatality) is starting to spread through raw milk to humans, and RFK Jr wants to stop all vaccines and stop pasteurization. 

So, it's going to look like Covid was a common cold in terms of the effects on the economy and human life.; Thing is, if Powell is blocked to hike and inflation spikes, everything will need to get more expensive in USD value. Assets go up, cash loses value fast. So selling into cash might not be the best position to take even if you expect what OP is saying.; >And I think Covid masked the economic recession

  
I see what you did there. Well played.; It all makes sense if Covid actually comes from Fort Detrick rather than Wuhan.; I like that conspiracy theory. Maybe Ackman will call into CNBC crying again about hell coming.; Musk is a sociopath and can’t keep his mouth shut under most circumstances so
I would tend to agree

A rug pull will happen retail and some pension funds will get bagged for a bit; Agree and I’ve commented along the same lines EXCEPT that Trump will not be willing to endure the blowback the harsh measures Elon wants will cause. I think that’s where a rift happens between those guys. And where Trump probably pulls back from the harsher policies, because at heart he’s a populist and doesn’t give a damn about the debt etc.; No it won’t be a black swan or anything like that, but we should see some fear at least; One possible catalyst: the House will pass a massive tax cut and inflation will start increasing again. That will take months. They’re also going to have huge battles over the budget and there’s a good chance the govt shuts down in March. And then the debt ceiling is going to be a problem. The House is 217-216 for a while and they don’t want any D votes. 

The question is does the market rally another 30% before it hits a big 20% dump?; Depends on how leveraged things are. The full ramifications of how truly fucked the economic system was leading up to the 2007/2008 housing market crisis were not well understood for years.  I would like to think that people have wisened up to the insanity, but my gut feeling is that fraud is rampant in the markets right now just given how ridiculously frothy it is.  No idea where it is, how entranced it is, or what the fallout will be, but all it takes is one event pushing the wrong thing in the wrong way and the whole house falls.


The more out of whack with reality it is the harder it's going to fall, basically.; You’re welcome!; https://preview.redd.it/arq0gw1dqi7e1.jpeg?width=456&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0934d5a92d94e31fdc82fddec43bb457b36b9b6d; Market instability = more power for regards to pump. lets go baby; Domestic manufacturing won't pick up for years, who wants to spend the cash to make a factory when you can just pass the cost onto the consumer? Seems unlikely companies will fork out billions just to bring American jobs back. Even if they did, wages and costs are higher in the US, so prices go up. I'm going cash mid Jan. Will sit back for a few months.; You said it way better.; A few until he said that cutting regulation will increase inflation; Yup, our food prices will go through the fucking roof. Way more than they did in 2022.; I don’t have anything. I’m just calling out what I think will logically happen because it has already happened. I’m waiting to see what 🥭 does his first week or 2; Good call. I’m interested to see how that plays out and how aggressive they will be with that.  Good call on geo as well; They definitely want to do the mass deportations.

Markets love stability.  The fact you're trying to guess if they're going to actually do the awful plans they talked about or not, is a very bad sign.

This disruptive chaos will be layered on to the fact that they always give tax cuts to the rich which *always* screws with the economy.; Yup. I’m getting flamed in some of these comments for saying he’s done a decent job. He did spend too long on the transitory train, but he can’t see the future and was going with the data he had at the time. Since then, he’s done a great job of telegraphing the feds moved to placate the market, and he’s gotten inflation back to a reasonable level without inducing a recession, which is pretty incredible. He could’ve Volker’d us when inflation was at 8%, but he chose to make incremental adjustments and let the markets stay healthy.; He can’t fire Powell, even if he wants to.  He will wait until Powell’s term is up in 2026 and then nominate someone else.; I’m on Europe. People in general don’t care about the markers or think it’s a casino. 

On the last weeks, fuelled by years of a rally and the perception that US stock is very solid. Literally from taxi drivers to coworkers, from the book store to the equivalent “best buy”. There’s always someone talking about how good the SP500 is as an investment. 

I’m starting to liquidate some of my hot US stocks and moving to cherry pick stocks around the world that are underperforming from what I consider “value companies”. 

There’s a mindset around that stocks/ETF from SP500 are a safe product that only goes up, everyone is going in, I’m getting to nervous.; February 13th.

Gonna be like a fucking bull in a china shop. ; Yup, he will though because he has to telegraph his every move, and then when the tariffs bring inflation right back, they’ll have to get embarrassed and raise again quickly.; Yeah there are some rumblings all over the world right now.

History Will Repeat Itself: A Bear Scenario that Will Likely Happen 

This is long so if you don’t want to or simply can’t read, just type a stock WSB response like “hurr durr stonks only go up” and move on.  If you have actual thoughts on what I’m saying or think I’m wrong, please share.  

To begin, we need to talk about what happened in 2018.  The market and Trump’s first administration were running smoothly.  Stonks only went up.  Then in 2018, they didn’t.  Why?  A few factors.  First, Trump introduced tariffs on aluminum, steel, and other goods to try to make American companies a more viable alternative to China(sound familiar?).   This essentially created a trade war with China, and led to China showing much slower economic growth than expected.  This led to a 500 point drop in the Dow on global recession fears.  

Later in the year, a newly appointed(by Trump) chairman of the Fed, Jerome Powell, had a conference in December.  By that point, the Fed had already hiked interest rates 4 times that year.  Powell stated at that conference that the Fed would likely slow rate hikes in 2019, but the market did not buy that and fears of a recession set in.  The Dow dropped 350 points soon after.  Trump made remarks about firing Powell after this debacle, but backed off.  There were other factors at play, such as the Schiller PE being 33.31(it is currently at 38.55), but those two factors were likely the biggest.  

One more important point:  Trump is obsessed with the stock market.  My favorite story on this topic comes from the Covid era.  On Friday, March 13,  Trump brought the CEO’s from a bunch of big players to the White House for a press conference.  He basically paraded them around, lauding how everything is going to be ok and Tim Apple is going to save us.  During this Friday afternoon circus, SPY ripped from 250 to 270 in an hour.  That night, Trump sent a signed copy of the chart from that day to Lou Dobbs to brag.   Then on the following Monday, we had another circuit breaker day as SPY tanked 11%.  

I tell you all this because history is going to repeat itself.  Trump has already touted 100% tariffs on fucking everything.  Whether he follows through with them, who knows.  He could just be using them as a threat to get leverage on trade deals.  But he has a precedent of using them, so I believe he will follow through.  His goal is to bring manufacturing back to the US, which is all well and good.  Jobs are good.  But one thing about manufacturing here as opposed to, say, India, is we aren’t going to be ok with being paid $1.38 a day.  The cost in labor to produce here is not nearly as appealing as producing in Vietnam, Bangladesh, or any other country that uses what is essentially slave labor with zero worker protections and zero environmental regulations.  Additionally, it will take years for any company that does choose to manufacture here to get up and running, and who knows what the political environment will look like once Trump is gone.  

We are also set up for another war between Trump and Powell.  This one WILL 100% happen.  Although it came in as expected, the last CPI showed inflation increasing slightly after months of continuous decline.  The PPI, however, came in hotter than expected.  This is a huge problem.  The Fed will for sure cut tomorrow, and Powell will give his speech on using his tools and data and taking in information as it comes, but I promise you this cut is concerning for him.  They want that 2% target, and Trump’s hot economy is not going to let them get there.  The combination of Trump cutting every regulation and allowing companies to shit in our water supply, along with his 100% tariffs on some imports, WILL BRING INFLATION BACK.  If companies have to pay more to import the goods that they sell, they will pass those costs onto the consumer.  There is no other way about it.  I know his goal is to bring manufacturing back, but that will take a lot of time.  And in the meantime, equities will suffer as inflation rises, and the Fed is forced to embarrassingly increase rates again.  

What I’m interested to see is how the battle of Trump vs Powell plays out.  There have already been a few articles regarding Trump possibly firing Powell, to which he responded “I don’t think so”, but he’s a liar so I don’t believe that.  Trump simply wants to be surrounded by yes men.  That is why he had the highest turnover of any administration in US history.  Honestly I think it just gets his dick hard to fire people, especially given “you’re fired” was his trademark phrase from that stupid tv show.  Powell has said it is illegal for Trump to do so, and that he is not leaving under any circumstances.  Personally I think he hates Trump, and rightfully so.  

So this is my prediction.  Trump gets into office, and on day one announces regulation cuts and tariffs.  He gives tax breaks to companies that choose to bring jobs to the US, and so on.  He wants economic growth at any cost.  Markets react mixed because the tariffs are concerning.  We start to see inflation rise due to importing costs rising.  Then Powell and the Fed fight over raising rates to tame inflation, because higher rates = slower growth.  Where we go from there, I’m not sure.  If Trump does try to fire Powell and succeeds,  I think that will be an extremely concerning look.  Powell has done a fairly decent job of getting things under control, and has done a very good job of telegraphing the Fed’s next moves.  The market hates uncertainty, and he knows that.  Trump firing him and installing a yes man will be extremely detrimental imo.  

So what do you think?  Will history repeat itself?; You need to read the story where Ethyl the Aardvark goes Quantity Surveying

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlOV7K-xOU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlOV7K-xOU); TLDR TRrump is a moron; Yeah nothing really makes sense anymore. One interesting conspiracy theory that someone else posited is a 2008 like crash would greatly benefit the wealthy who would position themselves properly, and be able to buy up equities and homes at rock bottom prices.; Nobody’s actually shorting though short interest is at all
Time low’s , markets are in euphoria everyones buying which usually means its about time to
Sell up 

Fearful when others are greedy; I’m not shorting. I’m saying that these events are very likely to happen, and Powell and 🥭 fueding over rates will not be good for equities. And they will fight.; Go look at the 2018 chart. He’s always cared about stock market. Market don’t always love him back.; “Nobody knew tariffs would cause inflation” guaranteed; He can’t fire Powell; He's an 80 year old toddler with dementia and no impulse control. A narcissist always believes they are making the correct move.; 100% agree; Honestly that’s a good theory. I agree that he’s talking a big game with the tariffs, and I would chalk it up to talk if he hadn’t done it before. The fact that there is precedent and the fact that he wants growth growth growth means he’ll likely do it again.; > He keeps talking about it now so the stock market will keep going down now, instead of going down after he presumes office. Market is kinda slowing down right now pricing in crazy tariffs

SPY is up 6% in a month.; SPY 40k; That’s part of it, but he absolutely is trying to bring it back. He’s made multiple posts about removing environmental regulations and giving tax incentives to companies that build here; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189); This is the way; I’m not saying a collapse will happen. I’m saying I would wait and see what kind of moves 🥭 makes in January and February before taking any big positions; Blaming him for something he didn't do. He did fix it though which was pretty remarkable.; Yes let’s blame the chairman of the Fed for companies taking advantage of inflation headlines to massively increase prices under the guise of ‘cost pressures’ - aka greedflation; What is it that you wanted exactly? Really high interest rates sooner to force recession and mass layoffs? ; Exactly. He didn't do the average person any favors. Of course people loaded to the gills with assets are gonna have a tough time seeing how shitty he did, because they benefited greatly.

Same reason older Canadians praise Trudeau and younger Canadians hate him. The older people watched their houses 5x in value over a decade, and the younger ones simply got priced out.; Completely agree that he was wrong about inflation for a long time. But you can’t deny that he hasn’t done a good job of appeasing the market by telegraphing literally every move well in advance for the past year and a half or so, and being super careful with what he says in conferences.    I intially thought the tariffs could be posturing, but he has a history of using them aggressively, and I think he will continue that.; I don’t think he mismanaged inflation as much as it might appear, I think he just lied about what he was actually doing.  I suspect the central bank knew they were managing the US debt so some degree because they know elected officials don’t have the stomach to manage it, so the central bank used their anti debt tool, inflation.; I agree, which is why I didn’t spend much time talking about it; It's still [remarkably predictive](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/articles/2020/07/20/the-remarkable-accuracy-of-cape-as-a-predictor-of-returns-1) of returns on market indices on decadal time scales.

I'm looking forward to a market where the Momo chuds get crushed, and those of us who read financial reports benefit. It will be great.; Exactly! He threw an absolute tantrum about the hikes, and he’ll do the same; Absolutely could be; Haha I was all cash unfortunately. I had some shit to do this afternoon and couldn’t pay attention. Feels good to kinda be right tho; Agreed. I’d love to get some big names on sale; I might give it more time. Just keep an eye on what he does his first couple of weeks. If he actually implements huge tariffs, I’ll be switching to puts; Yup. He apparently can be relegated to just another governor without breaking the law tho. But Powell can sue if 🥭 tries to do anything. Will be interesting to watch no matter what. I just know that a sitting pres trying to remove a Fed chair that disagrees with him is not a good look; Eh I’m not yelling CRASH, all I’m saying is keep some cash on hand in case of a sale.; Agreed, he did a fairly good job his first term because he didn’t really make any drastic changes. The economy was rolling when he got into office and he eased some regulations and let it keep going.  I’m going to pay attention to what he does his first couple of weeks, because I know he’s going to try to do a lot right off the bat.  If he follows through on the tariff talk, I expect to see a sharp uptick in inflation in March/april; Great points! And definitely something I should have addressed. This is another avenue toward a reduction in value of equities.  Deficit reduction would be very beneficial long term, but I don’t think he has the balls to follow through. You can’t have bull market and austerity measures at the same time. And his obsession with the market might lead him to abandon those plans, and just try to ramp up the economy and kick the deficit can down the road like we’ve been doing for so long.; Maybe not, but I don't think we will have a functioning government to prevent him from doing it anyway. I'd love to give him the benefit of the doubt though.; I could see that. I just think if inflation shows it head right off the bat and t rump is doing everything he possibly can to get the economy running overdrive, there will be a clash immediately.  I don’t see Powell backing down; Because no one knows if he actually will implement them, and if he does, how much they will be, and what countries they will affect.; This is a good point, and I shouldn’t have included regulation cutting in that statement. My main concern is the tariffs, and the fact that he wants to supercharge an economy where inflation is ticking up and consumer debt is at an all time high of 18 trillion dollars.; Good point. That is a possibility.; Nope; just chillin and watching; Joe did keep most of the tariffs in place, and even added. Joe and 🥭 were both responsible for the drastic rise in inflation and in adding a massive amount to our national debt. But I’m not discussing Joe here.  My point is that after a year of consistently lower inflation, we have started to see it tick up again. And if he does implement what he has been saying he will regarding tariffs, then inflation will rise again. He can invite whoever he wants to his house, what matters is whether or not he follows through with his already made statements, and that remains to be seen; Agreed. Euphoria will come to an end when people realize you can’t have endless economic growth and low rates; Thanks🤝; I’m waiting until I see what he does his first week or 2 in office. If the tariffs were all talk and he just cuts regulations and encourages business here, then it’s probably smooth sailing for at least a little while.; I don’t think we crash. I just don’t think it’ll be healthy for a bull market; I posted a link to an article regarding that. 🥭 can relegate him to being just another governor, and can technically remove him, but Powell can sue. The Supreme Court would hear it, and Powell would almost certainly win. My point isn’t that he will be fired, my point is that the arguably 2 most powerful men in the world fighting is not good for a healthy bull market; Cool emoji; Where did I say crash? If anything, I think it’ll be a similar tantrum to 2018; Holy fucking shit I do not think we crash. Nowhere did I say that. But the market hates uncertainty. And a battle between the 2 most powerful men in the world creates uncertainty. That’s my point; We’ll see. The interesting thing is that the repubs are in full control, so there really isn’t a way to shift blame if shit doesn’t go right.; They’ll likely just kick the can.  But how long can we do that for?; Great points; Holy shit. It's Chad Dickens.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*; That’s why I included that paragraph about his obsession. It 100% is a huge priority for him.  He wanted the market to crash SO bad during the summer. Remember when the Yuan carry trade unwound and VIX spiked? He latched onto that and kept calling it the Ka mala crash.  But as someone else pointed out: he loves the markets, but the markets don’t always love him, as evidenced in 2018 and 2020. You’re right, he will do whatever it takes to keep us moving up and to the right. But the market could see through that; I’d just wait and see what he actually ends up doing before you sell everything. Ultimately he wants the markets to be solid. It’s his obsession.; EXACTLY! The blame will always and forever be shifted to Joe. The day his love affair with Elon ends, TSLA will tank 20%. And it’s only a matter of time before it does. He has had a falling out with every close supporter he has ever had, and that pattern will continue; I live near one of those dead towns. It was a huge textile hub in the 60s. Depressing as fuck now. I think it’ll bounce back to a small degree, but like I said in the post, it will take a long time for it to happen if it does at all; That’s not true it happens all the time. Just never to me. 🚬; Yet we did drop 25% in 2022, so we know it IS possible.; I can just imagine an entire generation of newish traders who either got rich on crypto or stock mania experiencing their first wipe-out of all or most of their gains. 

Just thinking about their naïveté fading fast in a moment is exciting me.

Without suffering we learn little and hubris much; Cash is at the lowest levels now since early 2000’s.

If fib is a thing then the crash would be about 60 percent “bigger”. The issue is a ression will happen but the problem is that the people of America don’t have the cash flow from their hiring company to support living in a crash. The equity is locked up so large companies can live through the recession on a company level; Gonna be YUGE; Yes, that’s my strategy as well. Just keep DCA no matter what, but move a portion to the side in case of any volatility I can capitalize on ; TLDR the guy about to take office is more regarded than most people here ; signing the mortgage papers now.

I think covid and the unprecedented amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus papered over what was a weakening economy.; The 2019 crash was guaranteed in September with the famous repo fails and fed of ny bail outs. The first rumblings were in 2016 December. We were heading to complete inversion in late 2019 with the 30y and 6 month inversion which has never failed to indicate a recession yet.

Then covid happened and the rest is history.
But yes - 2019 was the year of recession and a crash in 2020 was guaranteed at that point. If it wasn’t covid there would have been some other trigger.

Problem with COVID is it gave all the governments an easy out and they borrowed like crazy. I don’t think they’ll be able to do the same with this next one.; They printed so much money in 2019 and 2020. It has artificially propped up the economy and inflated asset values. People haven’t lived a recession/bear market in a long time and it shows. People think it’s all memes and games until the inevitable crash of the everything bubble comes.; I hope he destroys ag.

To limit its spread would mean implementing practices that make meat and dairy industries lose money, as well as the fact that a large portion of the people who need regular testing are undocumented, and thus not inclined to do so. Additionally, it hops across species of wild animals incredibly efficiently, which is where it would gain the mutations to butt fuck us. 

Our vaccine stockpile for bird flu is a joke, and we have no evidence that it would be efficient against potential mutations.

These people will spook easy.; >The question is does the market rally another 30% before it hits a big 20% dump?

Yeah, timing this is the tricky part. My gut says next year, so it'll probably be a year or two after that; They're still not widely understood. Fucking Bernanke got a nobel for thoroughly misunderstanding what happened.; Pump n Trump; I replied to someone else who made that comment, and I agree. That shouldn’t have been worded that way. My main point is whether the tariffs are actually put into place or not.; I agree and isn't it amazing that we're talking about food prices going up and inflation without even mentioning the plan to deport field workers...

So many amazing policies that are going to kick in because these guys just bullshit their own reality.; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31224); >He can’t fire Powell, even if he wants to

He also can't just take nuclear secrets from the white house and pile them up in a closet at home.

Trump did a million illegal things and never faced consequences. He clearly has the supreme court on his side. He has complete immunity while acting as president. What makes you think something like laws will stop him? 

Powell is the perfect ""inflation scapegoat"" and Trump might make a big show about going after him. If his next guy is a spineless yes man that cuts rates despite spiraling inflation, the market will crash hard...and we have seen how well Trump does in crisis mode; Yup, when you start getting stock tips from random people who otherwise aren’t involved with investing I see it as a time to take profits and sit things out for a bit.; Sell the inauguration makes as much sense as anything; Inflation certainly didn’t curtail corporate earnings, since wages largely haven’t followed along.; Your voice is so soothing…; A bit slower please.; Why didn't OP just say it like this in the first place? He would have appealed to so many more if he would have just changed his tone for this. Thank you for this different, more refreshing perspective.; 👆; “Who could’ve seen this coming??”; He can’t, but they can fight; Exactly, I think it's way too pessimistic regarding America's institutions to suggest otherwise; He doesn't care about anything but grift, imo.

Your delusional ; Yeah, I’m hoping the tariffs are mostly posture. I think he has an advisor close to him. That is a big-time tariff hawk. Hopefully the position will moderate.; The market, from 2000 until now, has traded above the highest shiller PE recorded at any point in time prior to 2000.

Thus, per shiller pe, the market has been overvalued for the past two decades.

Even looking at the article you sent, it is premised upon data through 2011.

Like any valuation metric, it has value, but only insofar as you upward adjust what you consider to be “fair value” today relative to 50 years ago. 

This notion that valuation metrics benchmarked to data dating back to 1960, are applicable equally today, is nonsense.

What were the average gross margins of the top 25 stocks in 1965 versus today?

What was the capex then versus now for the biggest 25 companies?

It’s fine to consider things the Econ textbook said are important; but if you don’t use your accounting / Econ brain to then ask, is there a reason why these metrics don’t make sense anymore? 

Is there something fundamentally diff ab companies, today, compared to 20-50 years ago?; Not too many sales going on now in the market.  I think companies that make money and get cheep relative to stock price will happen again.  Keep an eye out for undervalued assets on the balance sheet.  Like the analyst missed the value of the App Store with apple about 10 years ago.  Just my .02; A lot of companies and governments are in panic mode about the tariffs. Its a bleak outlook in the near term for sure. I appreciate your thoughtfulness on the subject.; DJT “thinks” he’s smart. He’s a big dummy, he needs to let smart people handle shit. 

I’ll say he does do one smart thing: he will listen to opinions then form his opinion it seems, right or wrong.; This is Trump's second presidency, he will not have a third obviously. This is the situation where presidents start to care more about their legacy than re-election. So I would guess this is the time where he will be bold and choose radical measures.

And actually the cutting of the deficit opens up a nice, totally overlooked play in the markets: US debt. If you study market history, there is a bit of an oddball story about baron Rotschild, how he became truly rich. He bet on Britain winning the Napoleonic wars and figured that after the war the state would not need that much funding, so the very lucrative war bonds would not be issued anymore. But the demand for debt was still there, a lot of market participants wanted to safeguard their money by lending it to the government. By discontinuing the war bonds they decreased supply without tackling demand. So the baron stocked up on government bonds with as much leverage as he could afford. As the yield on government bonds plummeted due to high demand and low supply, he sold everything with an immense profit.

Now we have a peculiar situation that I rarely see mentioned anywhere: the almighty Dollar is the world currency indeed, but not just the physical cash, but the US debt also. The M2 money supply is at around 21 trillion, but the federal debt stands at 27 trillion. The government deficit is estimated to be 1.8 trillion per year. But this means that there are market participants buying this debt. There is a demand for that amount of US treasuries. Social security runs on them exclusively, but every 60/40 investor buys them for their 401k accounts, banks, insurance companies, foreign investors buy all this debt every year. Hell I have a large batch of US Treasuries despite living in Hungary, because I would not touch Hungarian government bonds with a ten foot pole.

But what happens if the government starts to issue less of it? There are hordes of investors who buy them, what happens if the demand stays the same but the supply dwindles? Investors will depress yields, creating immense profit for anyone holding long-term US government bonds. You see the present value of bonds inversely correlates with their yield. Long-term treasuries suffered a 50% loss in the bear market following the FED's rate hikes in the last two years. A collapse of bond yields would have an inverse effect, if the yield on 20+ year treasuries would collapse to the absolute low values experienced before, a 100% profit could materialize.

All I am saying that if someone would be absolutely sure that the US deficit will be tackled could stock up on long-term treasuries even on margin and reap insane profits. And yes, a nice bear market would motivate boomers to finally ditch stocks and convert their wealth to bonds, which would increase demand even more.; It only melts up now.;  Oh, it *happens all the time*. Except to *me*...

Will Emerson: Margin Call; Didnt even take a year to shoot back up higher than it was before the crash; That’s priced in!; My 🍑 hurts 😢; I just ate half a bag of chocolate covered Donettes; No problem! No chatgpt in this bitch; Yeah blow off top first. Who’s riding this shit all the way over the peak with me! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882); Crash on the horizon has been the story since Covid started. I lean bear and even I am unconvinced a crash will occur. They are just too good at propping things up, and there are real external wildcard investors like Canada has seen in real estate to relate it to just our country's situation. Bad investments for us are still good investments for external players.

I do know I am feeling financially unhappy due solely to inflation and taxes. Our income is in the top 10% and getting killed, but my friends and family with less income have really ramped up their verbal dissatisfaction quite a bit more. Wages are not keeping up, and it is really pushing to a point where there could be a revolution (why Luigi was so popular), or a huge crash to raise up the middle/lower classes in terms of wage vs CoL for those that are still employed. Same exact feelings of 2008. 

Manufacturing is not coming back to the US without huge CoL adjustments via subsidization or tariffs. But there is no situation in which inflation does not go up here. But sometimes national security reigns supreme, and I think this may be what is happening here. I am fine with that if it means staying on top while keeping China, Russia and Saudi Arabia in their place. But none of those paths are fun.; ""When?"" is the million dollar question; And the administration at the time said oh don’t listen to that the yield curve means nothing. We had many indicators telling us where we were headed, Covid hit and caused confusion, it pulled some industries like trucking out of their recession and into a boom only to be here in the present in an even deeper recession for the over correction; I find it very interesting that no one talks about the pre-Covid real estate market. We were headed for a big recession in the housing market. I remember reading articles in 2019 on what to do with the over built luxury housing market in the suburbs. No one was buying. Covid hits and luxury suburbs that had sold 4 houses in the prior year suddenly sold 100 houses. Without Covid those houses were headed for a huge price drop. Suddenly they almost doubled in value from the bidding war. 

The only thing propping up the housing market now is scarcity. People with 3% mortgages are not moving. Next year is going to be a struggle bus for real estate.; > Problem with COVID is it gave all the governments an easy out and they borrowed like crazy. I don’t think they’ll be able to do the same with this next one.

Why not? The FED can QE infitine money; so can other central banks. That will flow into markets because there's no mechanism for it to get anywhere else, and a tiny fraction of that trickles through to regular people.

If it gets bad enough that governments actually have to wake up to the problem and implement Keynesian stimulus, there being enough money is not an issue. The real problem is they probably won't do that until there's rioting in the streets, because wealthy interests hate diluting the value of their assets.; A good old war to cover the next one and Everything solved; Dumb people voting for “better economy” absolutely deserve the disaster because of their stupidity; That would be horrible for the USA.

If you compiled a list of things people would have said a president ""can't do"" prior to his first term that he actually did, legal or not, firing someone before their term is up would be one of the least shocking things.

Like you said, who's going to stop him? He's got the House, Senate, and Supreme Court stacked with people who simply do not give a shit, not to mention an incredible amount of judges at the federal level.

Unfortunately one of the extreme weaknesses in our government is the fact that the checks and balances sort of assume that the majority of people have good intentions and will act morally/ethically.

Yes, the market has been remarkably overvalued compared to historical norms for nearly 30 years. I blame Fed chairs from Greenspan through Powell, who depressed credit yields to goose the economy. They created an economy based around asset inflation, especially in McMansions, rather than around manufacturing prowess and profit. This will *all* unwind in time.

The article I offered was based around 10 year returns through 2021. I don't think an update to Dec 2024 would change the picture much.

The picture is very simple. Anyone can get nearly risk-free 10 year returns at 4.39% today. The earnings yield of the S&P 500 which normally trades at a risk premium is 3.24%, that of the Nasdaq 100 is 2.59%. For those who aren't inclined to stock-pick, the equity market indices aren't values today.

Personally, I've done well for myself scouring for value stocks for 25 years, something managers with lots of funds under management can't do. Micro/mid caps isn't their playground. I profit less than them in momo years, but my drawdowns for the crashes have been small. There will always be relative values. I anticipate that 2025, as in 2000, 2008, and 2020, I will be goosing my returns with select shorts, which I usually avoid.; Time for a TLT run?; I've thought about this.

It seems that people have amnesia about what Trump did in his first term the first couple of years. The market wasn’t doing well because of the tariffs he imposed and the trade war with China. And now he wants to expand his tariffs to Canada, Mexico and Brics. That’s why I plan on taking profits next month on my gains; Aim for the bushes 🤙; [deleted]; They can't be upset if they voted for it 🤷🏼‍♂️; Better economy, for plant owners.

Or you know, the Brexit fiasco and how much both hurt (but especially the UK) from reinstating tariffs. Here's a hint, it hasn't really helped. Here's an excerpt from chatgpt, because I'm lazy: Despite these opportunities, recent data indicates a downturn in manufacturing output. Forecasts for 2024 predict a 0.2% contraction in manufacturing output, a downgrade from earlier growth projections.

The stock may be up 35% YTD but their earnings per share in September were down about 1% YoY.

Apple’s fundamentals have been pretty flat for the last 2 years. Their last couple phone releases have been underwhelming, they’re not penetrating the global market due to pricing, their last phone software update hasn’t been received well.

I think that there are really only so many iPads, phones, and earbuds people are willing to buy. I think most of the reason they’re bought today is because of the status symbol they represent. However that will eventually change. Consumer brands do come and go.

92,The big boys getting bigger?,"I’ve been really reviewing and tweaking my overall portfolio recently and it has gotten me reading lots of threads and articles about diversification(small/mid cap, international, sp500) etc. With that rotating some QQQM/VGT/VOO into assets like VTI/VXUS/VT  as I previously had little to no exposure to things outside the USA large caps. 

However, I can’t help but help but feel like buying anything but the biggest companies is just going to weigh down the portfolio.

Hear me out, we see the biggest tech companies gobbling up more and more market share as Mag7 with hands in everything along with the other top companies. They wield so much market influence and power over any competition. Just saw an article about Walmart/amazon/costco picking up something like 60% of every incremental dollar on retail this year. It’s happening within every industry. Hospitals being gobbled up, grocery chains, cell phone providers, airlines, etc. 

In addition everything in the US is designed with extracting more and more money from people and funneling to these mega corporations. With hardly anything protecting everyday Americans from rampant greed, Whether it’s for profit healthcare, no mandated sick/PTO time, taxes/fees increasing at every level(sales tax, income tax, city taxes, car registration, insurance premiums, etc.), among many other things that other countries at least somewhat still protect. Congress is clearly bought by corporations and benefits by trading in these companies with legal inside trading and thus have negative incentive to change this status quo of the bigger getting bigger. 

At no point in history have so few companies wielded such vast global control and had such little regulation to stop them from continuing to bully their way over anyone smaller. 

TLDR: My conviction was and is that in this late stage capitalism world we live in. Especially in America.. there is no competing with the big boys. As money gets funneled to the ultra wealthy at an exponentially increasing pace people have less money and then end up spending with the biggest companies who have pricing and volume power over not just mom and pop shops but anyone not already dominating their respective market. So any diversification into non top companies is really a losing proposal. VOO, QQQM, and SCHG or similar tickers will only continue to accelerate and provide outsized returns vs most other categories. 

Not financial advise. Just my thoughts. Curious as to the communities thoughts. Let here some discussion.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hgfji2/the_big_boys_getting_bigger/,146,2024-12-17 18:16:06,"With all the big tech companies coming out in full force for Trump there is absolutely no chance of antitrust enforcement against any of them, so that potential risk to OP’s thesis seems out for now.; This sentiment could easily be applied to the world in 1900 as well:

>Here’s my thinking: it feels like anything besides the largest and most established companies is going to weigh down the portfolio. Hear me out. We’re seeing the largest companies—like the steel and railroad barons, the oil trusts, and the big utilities—gobbling up more and more market share. Companies like Standard Oil, U.S. Steel, and American Tobacco are consolidating entire industries. They’re gaining so much market power, they control not just their competitors, but entire sectors of the economy. I just read a report showing that Standard Oil alone controls nearly every major refinery in the country. The same thing is happening in the railroads, utilities, and even in agriculture—giants like J.P. Morgan & Co. and Rockefeller are picking up smaller players everywhere.

History rhymes, same as ever.; >At no point in history have so few companies wielded such vast global control and had such little regulation to stop them from continuing to bully their way over anyone smaller.

Have you got any numbers to substantiate this claim? Because I'm going to say the East India Company was uh, doing a lot of things back then, with even less regulation. The Dutch East India company could singlehandedly wage war, mint coins, and execute convicts, and it traded in the Dutch stock market.; [deleted]; Mega caps are already priced at a much higher P/E and P/B than small caps. So the question is not if large caps will grow faster, but rather, will they grow faster than the market already expects.; What type of investing are you intending this logic to apply to?  


If it's safe and long term returns like retirement, I think it fits pretty well. No one is likely to launch a successful Walmart competitor or new search engine.  


However, I don't think this logic holds up to many high growth industries and companies but you have to actually be specific about what you're referring to in that case. 


There will absolutely be pharma companies that do 100x that the large stable companies will not do. 


One or two of the air taxis companys will give a massive return that Airbus or Boeing never will. 


There's multiple smaller defense firms that will big huge returns vs LM/NOC/BA. 


There will certainly be green tech winners. 


Etc.; I completely agree with your assessment and almost all of my money is in FXIAX, however it will only take one mildly aggressive DOJ/FTC/etc to spook the market into investing less into these companies or heaven forbid actually take profits and begin the selling process.; I agree with you and have been almost all VOO for awhile. I am rotating ~10% to VXUS to get some diversification with a little drag on returns though.

I also think there are fewer small growth companies in the public markets now. By the time a company goes public, much of the growth has been extracted by private markets. Look at SpaceX or OpenAI. Now that normies can access IPOs fairly regularly, the rich have simply moved farther up the investment chain.; Generally speaking your not wrong, except with this bit...

> At no point in history have so few companies wielded such vast global control and had such little regulation to stop them from continuing to bully their way over anyone smaller. 

People forget their history, and how big some companies where in the past.  The Dutch East India Company, when adjusted for inflation hasn't been rivaled.  As big as our biggest companies are today, they still don't hold a candle to The Dutch East India Company, and there are a few other historical behemoths out there.

As people commonly say, history rhymes, things are very similar today to when Teddy Roosevelt started his many antitrust actions and broke up the organizations of the likes of Rockefellers, Carnegies and Morgans.

We have more rules and regulations than ever before, but that benefits those big companies who can fight never ending legal battles as part of usual business, or can afford to meet certain regulations by spending large capital investments that are unachievable by small local companies.

We need a modern version of Teddy Roosevelt and the square deal, for something of a system reset, and at least as far as I have seen we don't have one sitting in the wings.; A lot of the *big boys* are so ingrained in our life it's quite something.

And these are all *global* companies. With countries all over the world depending on their products/services to varying degrees.; > .. late stage capitalism.. no competing with the big boys

Well, in the futuristic film Demolition Man (1995), all the restaurants became Taco Bell and who am I to argue with Sandra Bullock? 

Seriously speaking, several big stocks have fizzled out that past investors/customers thought were impervious: Howard Johnson’s, Radio Shack, Sears, Monkey Wards, .. while others spontaneously combusted like Enron, Worldcom, etc.  Some long standing financial firms in 2008. 

In most sectors (not all) there’s up and coming competition ..  both companies and trends.  I’d also say IMHO part is a slight inflationary bias of most central banks post-2008 vs. anger at “shrinkflation”, .. boredom.  However you can imagine the shock of *all* the big brands failing at once (stock market, commercial real estate market ->mortgage market), which is why they’ll get thrown a lifeboat in case of a “crash”.

Any stock could go to zero, but the chances of all the stocks going to zero is nil, which is why this sub-reddit usually recommends “funds” (totally or partially).  Then there’s diversification which usually means high quality bonds (or funds of those) to offset stock mkt crashes.  

That said, there will be a crash sooner or later, having seen 1988 (though too young) and then being invested during 2008, luckily having a little bit in bond funds.   Most never see it coming, btw. 

My observation?  **The financial markets have the comeback ability of a cockroach in a Bangkok apartment kitchen**.; I agree with you, wealth consolidation will continue and investments like VOO and QQQ will be most fruitful. I still maintain all market exposure in my Roth with a Vanguard TDF but still most of my portfolio and future contributions are and will be VOO; Agree, I've started to buy S&P 500 Top 20 etf for this very reason. Own the biggest and best because they have their hands in pretty much everything. Don't see that changing in the future. ETF also rebalances quarterly so will capture the next big company moving in.; I agree as well. Every new tech company has the sole goal of being bought out by a FAANG. I think that betting on large caps is the best move going forward. These companies just have too much power and money.; >Not financial advise.

I am going to take this as financial advice and sue your ass; OEF (iShares S&P 100) has been my go to ETF for the last 5 years and I feel stronger about it now than ever before.  It’s a dog eat dog world and the big dogs will continue to grow bigger and bigger…

Compare the returns to VTI, SPY, etc. and you’ll see OEF has produced better returns for a while now. And yes, I consider 10 years a good stretch of time. 

For example, using Vanguards ETF comparison tool, it shows OEF’s 10 year return outperformed VOO 14.08% to 13.33%, annualized. In terms of cumulative returns, OEF outperformed VOO by 7.5% over the 10 year stretch. Two people investing 1 million dollars 10 years ago and the person using OEF would be 75K wealthier. Not bad…

1 year returns? OEF at 39.53% while VOO is at 36.36%. 

5 year annualized? OEF is at 17.69% while VOO is at 15.93%. Thats a ridiculous 8.8% greater cumulative return being in OEF over a 5 year period compared to VOO. You can’t ignore those returns. 

There’s absolutely no way this pattern is changing. Not for the next 4 years, at least.; The US may likely become an Oligarchy. You're right in that lots of funneling schemes are happening, such as crypto hype, Tesla stock. The suckers are the ones who get FOMO, because thats exactly what these ponzi schemes target.; There’s a saying “the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.” My investment strategy reflects this saying.; I agree but caveat that big tech will win in ways that incumbents in other industries can't match. I think there is still a lot of growth headroom in tech and if you look at the SP500 over the last 30 years, tech is becoming a larger component of it for good reason. Even at current valuations, the many of the Mag 7 still have room to grow and compound.; Well, VOO and VTI basically have the same returns. I wouldn't be surprised if VT returns weren't pretty close to them too.

VGT and QQQM both cover tech and have a lot of the same overlap. While I do believe diversification (especially into international) is important, you can still simply your portfolio by just putting it all into VOO and QQQM.; I can think at least 5 ways things can get even worse. But in the end it all begins by trading freedom with convenience; Look at the largest companies in the world each decade starting from the 1900’s and you will find that this has never been true and will never be true.; It's cause Europe decided to shoot its foot; Is there anyone I can talk to,this is to much 😭😭😭😭 I feel like giving up in life 😭; This is just the transition period to full technocracy by interplanetary corporations. Weyland-Yutani will be SpaceX, Google will be Tyrell Corp, Omni Consumer Products will be Amazon/Apple, Cyberdyne will be Palantir. The new government will be CHOAM.; I agree. There is an argument to be made about concentrating in 1 mega corp but for all of them to fail at the same time would be impossible. They're too important for the US economy if they actually do then it is unlikely the rest of the market would survive anyway. Generally if QQQ is at its peak then I would put some money into other indices that are down but my main vehicle is QQQ.; I think it depends on a couple factors. Gen Z is said to have shunned retirement saving already so my questions are if that actually is the case, does that mean the number of those throwing money in ETFs is being outstripped by the number of those retiring/selling off/withdrawing? And is that enough to taper an upward trending market? Do institutional investors create enough volume to offset that? Maybe I'm looking at this part the wrong way, otherwise I agree with most that have said anti-trust will be largely curbed under Trump, which with exception to a past blocked merger or two holds true.; https://www.ft.com/content/9a0da0d6-92b4-4034-ac25-7b4abcbb0bbe

Interesting perspective; I agree that we will trend towards bigger and bigger entities with little anti-trust enforcement in the next few years. However, as an investor, won't you miss out on the big guys buying out smaller entities? Typically a stock is bought out at a higher than market rate. If more of this happens, then smaller companies become better investments.; Look up factor investing. Plenty of academic research and historical evidence suggests that there are five factors that outperform for the same risk. Specifically answering your question, small cap performs better than large cap.

It's true that over the last 10 years large cap have outperformed but it's also well known that investors recency bias leads them to underperform.; How much you earn by large company going from 1000 to 1100 (so big absolute value) or small company going from 50 to 100 (so small absolute value)… but relatively? see Nvidia 10 or 5 years back; Hard to argue against the 'big boys' dominance...Mag7 and their ilk seem unstoppable. Diversification is wise, but betting against the mega caps in this landscape feels like swimming upstream.; People who describe current America as ""late capitalism"" have no idea how bad things can really get.; You’ve got a solid point. The big players are dominating everything, and it’s tough to see how smaller companies can compete. It feels like we’re in a stage where betting on the largest, most powerful companies makes more sense—they’ve got the cash, influence, and reach to keep expanding. But, diversification can still play a role. Even if the big boys keep growing, having some exposure outside of them can offer safety in case things change. It’s all about balancing that dominance with strategic risk.; The current big boys weren’t big boys 30 years ago. If you skipped Apple, Nvidia, Google, Facebook, and Amazon because they obviously couldn’t compete with Intel, Microsoft, IBM, Walmart, or Yahoo, you would have missed out today. 

Fundamentally it’s about potential growth. A $22b company will have a far harder time growing to $44b than a $2.2m company to $4.4m.; Unfortunately the only things that seem to unbalance a world order seems to be a war. So until we see another World War, things like this may not change. I pray for no war though, but I am unsure what could stop this imbalance.; I'll sell when the riots seem to be working, but so far betting on the corporations is the way to go.; I have to admit that the first thing I thought of when I was reading this post was ""East India Tea Company""!; Yeah, my mind immediately went to Standard Oil and US Steel.; I've seen estimates that in todays dollars the Dutch East India Company would be valued at 7.9 Trillion dollars and literally had its own fleet of ships and an army of 10,000 men.; No hard numbers other than most people in the world can go a day without using a product that at some point is touched/controlled by one of these top players today. Did that Dutch East India company have the ability to reach a billion to 5 billion users at any instant and control what they saw or emotions to feel. Im sure they controlled vast amounts of power and resources but I just don’t think it compares to where these current giants are.; “Now you’re not naive enough to think we’re living in a democracy are you buddy?”

Iconic; Would be a lot more appropriate to reference median net worth for the top 1%. Average going to be skewed heavily by the 0.001%; P/B is irrelevant for tech companies; Absolutely agree that there will be new players in many different industries emerging that individually have huge returns. But I’m moreso discussing as a collective of small Caps etfs, total ex-US funds, etc. that I don’t see competing with etfs that focus on holding the biggest companies. 
So sure a new pharma will pop off for 1000x return or a new software company will, but there are going to be plenty that fail to win against the giants and go under when the giant creates a dupe of their product or service.; > several big stocks have fizzled out that past investors/customers thought were impervious

Intel. In the 90s, they were *the* de-facto tech hardware blue chip.

R.I.P. Nana.

Transparency: Intel shareholder; And it’s a big But…; Just remember the consolidation to large cap American stocks has been a powerful 10-14 year trend, but for about 10 years before that it was all about ex-US (especially China and emerging markets) and small caps, and big US companies seemed very passe.       These trends seem most rock solid right before they are completely wrong.; You are betting on something that has never happened happening.

Could argue at this point you've missed the 10,000% growth of that company to get to that point and only brought in for the single / double digit growth from then on?; Why not IYW? Outperforms OEF. Just curious.; It already is a oligarchy, it's just coming more blatant.; What about VUG vs VGT? Is VGT mostly tech based growth?; The millennial and gen’z funding is something I think a lot about too. If the youngest generations as a whole have the least about of excess money and stop/cant contribute to 401ks, stocks, etfs etc. what happens when all the people that fed into it start pulling money out for retirement? 

Like you mention institutional investors might support for a bit but doesn’t the bottom fall out when no one is feeding those funds?; Exactly. It’s been like this forever; I guess I kind of agree but I think we’re in the beginning stages, and it’s to say that on the pendulum of capitalism we’re currently in a far swing right now.; This sounds the most chatgptish of all the comments; Exactly my feelings. Unless there is a global revolt against modern day capitalism and governments being controlled by corps, I just don’t see how it could change.; > I'll sell when the riots seem to be working

Are there riots anymore? Been a few years at this point since the last good ones, hasn't it? People barely protest for like a week and then move on.; I would dare say that owning one million slaves, a monopoly on trade, and having the ability to wage war is ""more powerful"" than showing you ads on a phone, but maybe I'm just old fashioned.; [deleted]; That's how it has always been.  The small etfs are based around a smaller number of companies having hugely outsized gains.

Also, you are way overestimating the capabilities of large companies.  Smaller companies are much more efficient and much better able to focus on the specific things that make their products good.  Bureaucracy, institutional momentum, and free loader employees who contribute almost nothing but stay on payroll are huge problems for big companies.  Middle management is necessary but also extremely wasteful and ripe for abuse and exploitation.

Many times big companies will buy a smaller one and then proceed to begin trashing what made the small company valuable, which costs customers (but increases profit, for a time).  Sometimes they earn more than they paid before the product line has lost a ton of value, sometimes they're able to fold it into their existing lines without losing their value proposition, and sometimes they accidentally kill their revenue & profit before they ROI, while customers go to a competitor.

Look at Broadcom buying VMWare for an example that may or may not backfire.  They increased profit a lot, but are hemorragging customers to competitors.; I think you need to factor risk into your model. 


If you buy a global ETF or Russel 5000 or something with a huge collection of companies you're getting a lower risk level in exchange for lower return. 


I believe large companies out-performing small cap is also only the last 10-20 years as well so there's likely additional broad market factors that have changed. Those could change again in the future but you'd have to do more research on why that happened.; That’s right; The thing is that 10,000% growth would come from a smaller company that would be weighted maybe between 0.10-0.03% in the S&P 500 (https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500). So an initial 500k investment would mean only 150 of my money was in it. So how much growth of your money would you have really seen?

Compared to having way more of my money in the best of the best with larger weightings (https://www.ishares.com/us/products/339779/ishares-top-20-us-stocks-etf). 

I don’t want to buy small cap etfs as many of the businesses could fail. 

Just like money compounds over time, i have the same view with large monster companies compounding and swallowing up everything in their way over time.

I’ll caveat this with saying i have a large portfolio so i don’t need 100x baggers, just consistent single/double digit growth.; They are both tech heavy. I wouldn't have both in the same account.; VGT is a specific information technology fund.

Look at their holdings, you won't see all the Mag 7 in there.

I hold VGT it's been amazing.

If I put in 200k 10 years ago I'd be 1.3 million today (I didn't but I wish I did).; Well, lower volume of trading might hamper prices but ultimately the stock is also a reflection of the value of the company/companies the stock holds. As long as Gen Z is working then I can't see a huge drop off in value but maybe we'll see slower growth. It might also just be a cultural trend that started with Millenials where saving started slightly later as an average based on things like general cost of living and stagnant entry level wages.; eh, I feel like this summer will pick up where 2020 left off, but who knows; I guess I didn’t realize how big they were but found the below on a quick search. 

“The East India Company was probably the most powerful corporation in history. At its height, it dominated global trade between Europe, South Asia and the Far East, fought numerous wars using its own army and navy, and conquered and colonised modern day India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Burma.“

But this honestly sounds more like a pseudo empire/nation with its military more than just being a business.; The dollar isn't trying to fuck you over because it has narcissistic and emotional tendencies though; Does the expense ratio matter to you when comparing the two ETFs?; There is always more protesting when the democrats aren't in office since they fund a lot of them, no need to fund protest when it would be against yourself.; Well, there's some distinction to be made between the East India Company (British, called EIC), the Dutch East India Company (Dutch, called VOC), as they were actually competing and even at war with each other at times I think, etc. But I would say both were pretty big business rivaling the power of states, yes. Still companies though, any citizen of the Dutch Republic could buy stock in the VOC in the Amsterdam Stock Exchange in \~1600, and apparently the dividends were really good. In fact, I think the VOC was the first company with an IPO in the world.; One is .04 and the other .1. The expense ratio can matter, but IMO with these two, no.; As I just stated in another thread it's a big club & you ain't in it.; Your not wrong.  I did jump over to that other thread, and I do get a chuckle about the pardons.  I know one of the people who got one, and he is not in any club what so ever.  He made the local news in a WTF this guy is pardoned story, but not one of the crazy ones to make the national news, that said, it convinced me that the pardons this go around was computer generated and not reviewed."

You should buy leaps on SPY; Name verified; Less risk; Mara is the second biggest bitcoin holder behind MSTR, they have a lower cost of capital than any other bitcoin miner, they have a higher hash rate than any bitcoin miner, bitcoin will likely explode in 2025 due to purchases by the US government and all foreign governments, many companies will likely begin to purchase bitcoin in 2025, taking a page out of MSTRs book. MARA will continue to purchase bitcoin. MARA builds their own cooling systems which allows them to overclock their miners up to 80%. MARA has the cheapest energy costs of any miner and they continue to get cheaper.

I don’t know what makes you say that. But you do you.; I’ve honestly been only plays swings and long contracts as of recently. Orange hair guy is gonna make us some gooooood money; And OTM options are hella expensive; Because of the volatility. 

Not the fact that it won’t go up in price.

It’s that vega will cause you to lose money. 


How long have you been trading options?; Exactly; OTM options are always cheaper. Because they have no intrinsic value.; I understand what you’re saying I just disagree. For that to happen MARA would have to stay under $32 for over a year. I think that’s highly unlikely; Soooooo…. Those Mara calls; Yes lol; And what you’re saying only applies if I hold till expiration. IV will remain high for the foreseeable future. If it pops in the next few months this will fly; They didn’t do well. Evaporated my gains this year. Huge L; My next questions are;

How long do you intend on holding? 

Are you managing delta with any type of strategy?

Lastly, if we see a 5% decline what do you see the price of the leaps at? 

Not trying to poke hole, genuinely curious. I lost a lot on leaps with PLTR years ago; I have a black scholes python script I could check but honestly my rationale is just not that technical. I think stock go up within year. I buy calls. I no worry about Vega because I think IV will remain high the whole time. No price target

You forget this is WSB and I’m a regard; I chose higher delta to manage risk; I’m looking forward to seeing your payout; Me too if there is a payout. MARA down 10% today 🥲"

I actually love Apple's M4 launch and they will continue to roll out devices in Q1 and Q2. The only thing that I'm worried about is the iPhone. 

I like Amazon as well because Apple is using Amazon's AI chips for their AI endeavors. I am not currently long AMZN but I do like them.

Warren Buffett sold a lot of his Apple stock though he said it was more for tax purposes. He's sitting on a huge cash pile.

95,NVDA vs AVGO,"NVDIA vs Broadcom
I have a pretty big position in NVDA but am obviously not too thrilled with the stock performance since June.

While I am still bullish on NVIDIA and AI, there are a few things that make me pause

Apple doing its whole Apple Intelligence thing not planning to spend a single dollar with NVIDIA but rather building custom chips with Broadcom
Anthropic going all-in with Amazon's Trainium chips. In the past, big funding for AI startups meant a big check for Jensen. This didn't happen here and could set a precedent
Broadcom announcing that it will build 1 million XPU (ASIC) data centers with hyperscalers.
So while NVIDIA is clearly ahead of AMD, I don't like the shift to Broadcom ASIC chips. And to be honest it makes a lot of sense to me that Meta or Amazon would build their own chips to do stuff like recommendation engines.

So my question is: would you diversify/sell some NVDA stock to buy AVGO in order to be able to benefit both from the GPU and ASIC trends?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hg7zpe/nvda_vs_avgo/,12,2024-12-17 11:42:53,"

[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse); You know that NVDA will pump when you sells 😏; Buying AMD ![img](emote|t5_2th52|52627); Avgo announced AI chips blah blah. 
But NVDA already producing the AI chips

See the difference ?; So you’re basically asking if you should chase the hype? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); I hold both; NVDA already has the future built in. AVGO had not, and AMZN has been lagging for years. 

Riding tide lifts all boats, and NVDA has gone so high as to be grounded.; I try not to buy right after the 40% spike unless there's really clear reason there's going to be another one.

Willing to bet if you're interested in AVGO, you can probably get in cheaper if you're patient.

Also, who's building all those chips for Amazon? What's their market cap?; When you come to a stock picker's fork in the road always remember to ask yourself what would nancy do.; It’s not a case of ‘vs’.; Yes, chase the regarded dragon. ; I think the world (or TAM) is big enough for several big players. Nvidia is the only one with a full stack platform though, all the way from hardware to networking to software. I think that will be very hard to compete with. ; Cool story.; I’d say NVDA is better but I like both companies.; Broadcom has been acting like a lil bitch lol; Per NASDAQ, NVDA’s forward PE for 2027 is 26.8. It’s not too expensive in my opinion. But even so, I own NVDA, AVGO, and AMD. Why choose?; Why not buy Nasdaq and gain exposure to all?; i read somewhere that NVDA is up 1600% this year and AVGO is only up 1200% so maybe people comparatively see more upside in broadcom...; Haha of course it will; The last time a AVGO executive made a purchase of stock was last year. Everyone has been consistently selling stock over the last year.; Who is You?; Lisa Su lost all my money; Buying AMC; Broadcom makes custom chips for very specific and specialized tasks, and AI accelerators. Qualcomm does the same thing, so does intel and AMD and Marvel and every other semi producer. They dont have a NVDA competitive advantage or a moat.; The difference is there’s more upside for more risk; The right answer. ; Also non programmers don't understand how big NVIDIA is ahead, ever since I worked with ML and LLMs and computer vision it has been clear to me: CUDA is NVIDIA'S moat. There is not much like it, things like opencl and rocm don't have the same adoption.; this is more of a rising tide eats your lunch type of deal; Making a come back rn tho; Can you sell today then? Thanks.; They might have a moat.; Yeap agreed. There are a lot of semi conductor companies. 
But cannot fight with NVDA. 

I still prefer nvda.; Yes, and this as well.; This is the answer. CUDA will take 5-10 years for anyone to create their own framework. Where will NVDA be in 5-10 years? 25 years ahead.; Sell some AMD stock while you're at it as well. Papa needs a new CPU."
96,Rate my portfolio - turnover advice,"I'd appreciate a feedback on my current portfolio. Here are the positions with the % size.

AAPL 2.3%
QQQ 11.4%
DELL 2.8%
IONQ 56.9%
IWQU (iShares World Maxi Quality factor sector neutral) 4.6%
LVMH 3.6%
NVDA 5.7%
SMH 2.1%
CASH 4.1%
Saving deposit (tracking 1Y TBill) 5.9%

All of this are at decent gains, except for DELL which is currently at a -27% loss and I am planning to cut it entirely. IONQ obviously has achieved an extreme gain and I am aware of the concentration risk. I have a price in mind at which I will trim some profit, but I am comfortable with the risk of seeing my portfolio volatility spiking up just because of that position.

In addition to the above holdings and outside of my trading account, I have another 10% in my banking account and I am saving for a mortgage deposit over the next year. Pension contribution is sorted out and my income and earning potential are decent enough to afford the investment risk of my portfolio. 

QQQ and IWQU are the two long term holdings that I am building; I plan to increase these two over time with further contributions and gains from other positions.

CASH is there for buying opportunities if the market dips at any point.

SAVING DEPOSIT might be invested or transferred to my bank account for the mortgage deposit.

I'd like to have your opinion for what I am planning to do with my holdings. I am thinking of the following alternatives:

- sell DELL and LVMH and invest everything in QQQ and IWQU with a 70/30 split
- sell DELL, keep some in CASH, invest the rest in other high risks names that I have been following. 

The reason of these two alternatives is that I prefer not to touch IONQ because it has the potential to generate a life changing wealth, but if I lose it all I am okay with it, and as such I'd rather raise cash from a low growth holding (DELL) and from LVMH that might still grow but I am okay with the profit that I made so far.

I am looking at the evolution of the Semiconductors, hence why I am not touching SMH. I think that the sector has more room to run in 2025, but it will be the next one to liquidate and move to my two long term holdings.

Thanks!

97,The Dow Theory & Merry Christmas 🎁🎄 ,"Volatility remains relatively high, making options trades more lucrative as the payouts are amplified by IV. Too much institutional and retail money is piled into the same trades, leaving markets vulnerable to cascading selloffs. 

Momentum strategies rely on positive autocorrelation (recent winners keep winning). Once negative returns emerge, negative autocorrelation sets in, driving sharp reversals as positions unwind.

Buy Put Options:
Target broad market indices like SPY (S&P 500 ETF) or QQQ (Nasdaq-100 ETF) AAPL, TSLA with expirations in 30-60 days to capture near-term downside.

Vertical Put Spreads (For Efficiency):
Example: Buy a SPY $460 put, sell the $450 put to reduce premium costs while maintaining solid downside exposure.

Go for an asset allocation ETF like XEQT or VEQT for a better risk-adjusted returns using just a single ETF. XEQT or VEQT has every relevant stock across the globe including Emerging Markets which matter. Both of these can be held into TFSA & RRSP as well as Non-Reg if required. If you want to be an actual passive investor and ride the gains from the Market, then both of these ETFs will fulfill that criteria. Additionally, they are canadian-domiciled ETFs which means no need to get bothered by FX conversion fees when buying US domiciled etfs or stocks.

Please don’t chase past performance by investing in Thematic ETFs like QQQM, VUG, VONG, SMH, VGT, FTEC, SCHG, etc. or Canadian Equivalents like XIT.TO, TEC.TO, QQC.TO, etc. as they introduce uncompensated risk into your portfolio which may often provide short-term growth but stagnate over long run as compared to broad market ETFs. And their MER is mostly high comparative to an Index Fund ETF which increases your average weighted portfolio MER as a result.

Just buying either one of these ETFs would make your life easier by simply DCA’ing or Lump Sum investing into it whenever you have cash available. Wealthsimple offers fractional shares but both of them are on lower end of share price, so it’d be convenient to purchase a full share even if you have accounts in other brokerages and they don’t offer fractional shares.

Also, having a 20-30% home bias i.e., for Canada will make your portfolio robust in terms of risk-adjusted returns.

Note: This is simply a suggestion. I am not a financial advisor nor have any personal interests vested in iShares or Vanguard.

You don’t have to buy a whole share at once, you can own fractions of it. Here’s the chat GPT explanation of why fixed $ is better: 

Investing a fixed dollar amount is generally better because it provides predictable investments and helps manage market fluctuations through dollar-cost averaging (DCA). With DCA, you invest the same amount regularly, buying more shares when prices are low and fewer when prices are high. This can lower your average cost per share over time and reduce the impact of market volatility. A fixed number of shares can lead to overbuying when prices are high and is harder to track for long-term goals."
100,Stocks Trading 101: My Guide to the Basics,"When I first started looking into stock trading, the sheer amount of jargon felt overwhelming. Over time, I realized that understanding these terms is half the battle. Here are some key concepts and terms that helped me make sense of it all.

Stock: A piece of ownership in a company.  
  
Share: One unit of stock or a slice of the company pie.  
  
Broker: The service or app that connects buyers and sellers; I’ve used platforms like Robinhood and TD Ameritrade to get started.

Bid Price: The most someone is willing to pay for a stock at that moment.

Ask Price: The lowest price someone is willing to sell for.

Spread: The gap between the bid and ask prices. Smaller spreads often mean more activity and easier trades.

Market Order: Buying or selling instantly at the current price.

Limit Order: Setting a specific price at which to buy or sell; I use this when I don’t want to pay more or accept less than a certain amount.

Stop Loss Order: Automatically sells to prevent big losses if the stock price drops too much.

Trailing Stop Order: Similar to a stop loss, but moves up with the stock price to lock in profits as the price rises.

Bull Market: When stock prices are generally going up.

Bear Market: When stock prices are falling.

Volatility: Measures how much stock prices go up and down, with higher volatility meaning bigger swings.

Liquidity: Refers to how easy it is to buy or sell a stock without affecting its price much. Stocks with high liquidity feel less stressful to trade.

Candlestick Chart: Shows price movements over a specific period with details on opening, closing, highest, and lowest prices.

Support Level: A price where a stock tends to stop falling and bounce back up.

Resistance Level: A price where a stock tends to stop rising and reverse.

Trend Line: Shows the general direction of a stock’s price.

Moving Average (MA): Smooths out price fluctuations to reveal trends more clearly.

Earnings Per Share (EPS): A company’s profit divided by the number of shares. Higher EPS usually indicates more profitability.

Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E): Shows how much investors are willing to pay for $1 of earnings. A high P/E could mean the stock is overvalued or reflect high growth expectations.

Dividends: Portions of profits paid out to shareholders, a nice bonus for holding the stock.

Market Cap: The total value of all a company’s shares combined. A useful way to compare company sizes.

Day Trading: Involves buying and selling within the same day. It’s fast-paced and demanding.

Swing Trading: Involves holding stocks for days or weeks to profit from short-term trends.

Long Position: Buying a stock and expecting the price to rise.

Short Position: Selling a stock you don’t own, hoping the price will drop so you can buy it back cheaper.

Risk-Reward Ratio: Balances potential losses and gains, with a 1:2 ratio meaning risking $1 to potentially make $2.

Diversification: Spreads investments across different stocks or sectors to reduce risk.

Leverage: Borrowing money to trade bigger, amplifying both gains and losses. I use it cautiously.

Margin: Money borrowed from a broker to buy stocks. Helpful but carries real risks.

S&P 500: Tracks 500 of the largest U.S. companies and is a good measure of the overall market.

Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA): Tracks 30 major companies and has a more traditional focus.

101,The key tail risk stems from NVIDIA's heavy reliance on TSMC for chip manufacturing.Growth linked to Supply !?,"https://preview.redd.it/ev235e1cl97e1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf925804b735dde3813077eafd571455a792284b

 Nvidia's supply Chain ! 

Rev: 10.11%"" and COGS: 35.82% = **Revenue Exposure**: This indicates that **10.11%** of NVIDIA's revenue is dependent on its relationship with **TSMC** (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company). 

In simpler terms, **10.11% of NVIDIA's revenue** relies on products or services that come directly from TSMC as a supplier. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) Exposure**: This means that **35.82%** of NVIDIA's cost of goods sold\*\* (i.e., the cost it incurs to produce its products) is tied to TSMC.

TSMC manufactures NVIDIA's chips, which are essential for NVIDIA’s GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) and other products. Since TSMC supplies these critical components, **over one-third of NVIDIA's production costs** go directly to TSMC.

---

**Ticker:** NVDA

**Direction:**  Potentially Down (depending on geopolitical stability)

**Prognosis:**  Nvidia's heavy reliance on TSMC for chip manufacturing (35.82% of COGS) presents a significant supply chain risk.  This could impact future profitability.

**Geopolitical Risk:**  Taiwan's geopolitical situation is a major factor.

**Bonus Meme:** KEEp ON BRAIN TAIWAN! (as per the original post); TSMC makes everybody's chips

Optics run the AI machinery.; Undervalued, 500 eow; AVGO is absolutely crushing it rn. [Their AI revenue is projected to exceed $12B in 2024](https://beyondspx.com/article/broadcom-inc-nasdaq-avgo-the-semiconductor-powerhouse-fueling-the-ai-revolution) and they're making custom AI chips that smoke the competition. Plus that Apple server chip collab is straight 🔥

Fuck waiting. This isn't some overhyped meme stock - AVGO actually prints money. [Free cash flow of $17.63B last year](https://beyondspx.com/article/broadcom-inc-nasdaq-avgo-the-semiconductor-powerhouse-fueling-the-ai-revolution). They're balls deep in both semiconductors AND software. Double dipping like a chad.

Those 6 month calls gonna print harder than JPow's money printer. Not financial advice but I'm jacked to the tits on this one. 🚀🚀🚀; AVGO is not a meme stock or hyped stock; even AMD had more hyped lasts year than what AVGO has now.

The ASIC has a real market. It won’t be as big as nvidia since nvidia provides the whole package of verticals integrated solution and able to sell to all kinds of companies including manufacturers, financial companies, government etc. 

AVGO customers are only these with enough money, solid software teams, demands for self-independent AI infrastructures.  Only a few of customers such as AWS, Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, meta, apple qualified. 

Engineers are working g their asses off build a better ecosystem that decouples Nvidia. The demand is real, but be careful with people who tell you that it gonna crush nvidia. They aren’t same and never expect it goes beyond nvidia.; Intel bro; Is avgo a buy?; It depends on what you're doing. ASICs are one-trick ponies, they're limited to running the one algorithm that's literally cut into their silicon. But because of that, they can run that one algorithm faster and more efficiently than a GPU ever can.

A GPU vs an ASIC is like a car that can drive anywhere at 70 MPH, vs a bullet train that just barrels down one rail line at 200 MPH. Do you need the versatility or do you need the speed.

Anyway, the ""tensor processing units"" that Google is ordering to run their chatbots are ASICs. I'm not familiar with the architecture, but they must feel good about their LLM model in order to pretty much lock it in.; The people who researched the comparison between the two are loading up on NVDA now; Seems good entry for a good pile and 135 target price.

[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse); Analysts and especially dan fucking ives just wake up, check stock prices and then think of a story they will attach to the price target they just pulled out of their ass. ; Regarded analysts who just go where the wind is blowing. Assholes.; Corrupt as fuck. Calls it is.; 100% bearish on that ridiculously overvalued stock. But 0% balsy to fight the crowd and corruption and short it.; Removing regulatory hurdles isn’t going to magically make Tesla’s FSD work. It seems more likely to be a boon for Waymo. The all-vision solution that doesn’t rely on detailed maps seems like it’s always going to present a higher risk of major accidents than the multisensor/mapped approach. ; Dan Ives is such a fraud. His suits are also horrendous.; this is a pump. smart money has been in full control since last week it's a bull trap. it should correct in the near future.; Oh yea the regulators are the reason why Tesla FSD drove your family into a truck.; [deleted]; I won't do it because it's a crook and corrupted economy, but in a normal world, anybody shorting Tesla should become a millionnaire .

Absolutely nothing justifies this valuation.; Yeah cool it’s only been 8 years since I ordered my solar roof. Sure they’ll be ramping production soon.; Dan Ives is just tesla bull. An analyst can give whatever targets they want in a bull/bear markets and it would be out of touch to reality.; With its all time high, the main theme of trading TSLA is who's the seller? Same as all other all time high stock, its just that TSLA now holds probably the strongest reason not to sell, which is the close tie between its CEO and the president of the most powerful country in the world.

And if no body who hold the stock sell, there's no selling pressure, there for stock will not fall. It's really as simple as that.; A two trillion dollar car company.  My gosh, the top has to be close.; The biggest thing fueling this massive move is that people say, ""TSLA is way overvalued, I'm going to short it or buy puts.""


They are wrecking their accounts and getting margin called. L; Some people still think Tesla is a car company?; Welovebush Securities.; the question remains - will anyone. actually use this? and how many will actually allow their car to drive around and robotaxi whilst they’re at work, when they find out the car owner (not tesla) will be liable for any accidents while it’s driving itself around.; If y'all got polio you get some sick tesla robot crutches.; Doesn't make much sense to me. 

Just logically, we seem to all acknowledge the car business will be commoditized in the long run. Plenty of non-china allies will sell fantastic batteries to US companies (Panasonic & Samsung). So we dont think the margins coming from there. 

Waymo currently works and is valued at somewhere near 50b, and thats a recent fundraising round so its accurate. I just dont buy that the FSD is worth 1.5trillion dollars, and waymo is worth 50. Keep in mind next year Lidar for waymo will cost \~$800 in hardware, prices have been coming down fast. And Lidar does let you see things cameras don't. 

If Teslas most valuable asset is FSD, and the cost of recreating FSD is dropping exponentially (which it is since compute is growing exponentially) it just seems like a very difficult moat to keep. 

All i know is today i would let a waymo pick my kid up and to a friends, and theres not a chance in hell i'll feel comfortable doing that in a tesla for a bit.; Obviously there's no stopping Tesla now. It may never drop again.; Fellow regards, please short more tesla.

I beg of you.; $600 is probably low it pumps all year. Regulatory capture in a meme presidency; Cope bears, you're fucked.; Tesla is basically a bid on monarchy and not a car company anymore.; Chatgpt out with a revolutionary AI Chatbot and had 5 copycats just as good in 3 months. AI self driving is not gonna be some moat that tesla will control its gonna be replicated and perfected by multiple companies almost simultaneously and will be a gimmick not some trillion dollar industry. Hate this scam stock; Despite this discussion, does anyone know if Elon will use Tesla for his AI to compete with Chat GPT, or will he use another entity?; For fucks sake just write ""bribe for the ages"" so we can have an honest discussion


(Long TSLA); Ill still be here for when it crash. Buy the rumour sell the news; As someone who has been following Tesla for a long time, most people here are just bitter they’ve missed the runs and probably dislike Elon and his companies solely because of his politics. FSD works great and continues to make dramatic improvements year over year. Tesla has so much more going than just being a car company and once the majority of people wake up to that, they will begin to see the valuation is justified; I think one analyst has a hard on for pumping the market to unrealistic prices.; Tsla is my first 10 bagger.  Put $4k in back in 2019.   

Buy and hold wins every time degens!; They sell 1.13% of cars in the US.; Yeah probably I don’t know 

I think it’s all inevitable and that the current data suggests it should be allowed if not mandated.; Dan ""Let's pound the table"" Ives is a colorful anal-ist who knows nothing; He will get there, imo even the first to be 10t doesn't seem impossible anymore. It makes no sense, but i guess that's elons thing.


Love it ; Betting on government corruption and preferential treatment is sick af!; It's a worthless meme stock, no connection to the Tesla company at all at these valuations. You could just as well buy Doge coin and pretend that this is a share of the Tesla company. So, I added some shorts today at around $450.; What goes up must come down.

Just need to figure out when ...; Tesla's FSD tech gonna print harder than JPow. [Their internal data shows FSD will beat human drivers by Q2 2025](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-poised-2-trillion-market-165634504.html). Not even close. Straight facts. 

Energy storage revenue already up 52% YOY. Megapack and Powerwall deployments going brrrr.

Wedbush's $515 PT ain't even the ceiling. $2T market cap incoming. Tendie town population: us. 

TSLA bears in shambles rn fr fr.; Time to lower the car prices; U are just a DEMONcrat musk hater obviously musk will replace the entire government with tesla model G (spot) ,,, and bitcoin will go to 1 trillion.; Dan Ives is the most regarded (anal)yst on WS; It’s making us $ tho hehe; bro it's 9 pm in the AI party that goes to 4 am; Analysts should get a report card for what they put out; Dan Ives is long-time Tesla bull and had a 300+ PT on Tesla when it was sub $200 months ago, and people thought he was crazy.; Why would you want to go against the wind?; He is an asshole but u can't accuse him of being stupid; State capture in full effect, Tesla to a million; Has anyone even provided a “legitimate” thesis as to what this new admin will do to REALLY help Tesla?

Yes, getting rid of the EV credit will hurt TSLA’s competitors more than it will them, but non-Tesla EV sales are already in the gutter, and always have been. Their gap appeared to have shrunk in recent quarters, which may very likely be due to Elon’s personal behavior having ostracized people that were previously buying Teslas. 

Removing the EV credit will still make Tesla’s more expensive for consumers.

So Tesla will increase their already dominant share of EV sales, but the overall volume of those EVs will also shrink. 

If 50 out of every 100 EV sales being a Tesla shifts to 40 out of every 70 EV sales being a Tesla, how does that equal another trillion in market cap?; Indeed . Am buying in soon; Welcome to the dark side. And I don’t just mean Tesla.; The risk of Elon being jailed for corruption is priced in, I guess.; Corruption knows no sides. Both sides are equally corrupt.

Money is money. Calls it is.; I’m that balsy. Down 29.31% rn.; Exactly how I feel. I’m thinking of testing the waters a bit though. The rally is unbelievable; Musk has a ton of influence over Trump right now, I assumed that was a major cause of his recent massive increase in net worth. The Trump administration (or any administration) can make specific rules/carve outs that specifically benefit one company, (I.e special federal tax benefits for Texas based EV car companies, converting the federal car fleet to EVs with the contract going to Tesla, all federal offices converting to solar with Tesla winning the contract, etc.) 

I think that’s the play here. A very wealthy and powerful businessman is tied at the hip to the incoming administration who is known to be especially kind to those close to him personally…. It would make sense to bet Tesla is going to get increase business. And honestly, I’m thinking there might be a point when conservatives start buying Teslas just bc they associate Musk with Trump (sort of like the My Pillow Guy, All my Trump supporting relatives own a My Pillow).; Can't wait for right wingers to be for tort reform again. We're probably overdue for that news cycle. These corporations won't want to be responsible for any crashes, and the right wing will make sure that is the case.; Legit question. I have seen so many videos of FSD, most of them in cities granted. But it seems to work extremely well. So when people say FSD sucks do they just mean outside of well mapped areas? Seems like the easy solution is making it only work in certain areas.; As long as your solution is better than humans I don‘t see the problem. It is funny how people accept car accidents caused by humans, but go wild when AI makes a mistake (far less). ; Remind me in 5 years.

Dis gonna be gud. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); 4 years from now: As Tesla approaches a 5 trillion dollar market cap, who should musk back in the next election?; Smart money has been in full control for the last 8 weeks, have you not seen the OI on the options chain?; People want to be on the winning side of things.

It's feeling pretty imminent, but I'm guessing it could also easily keep going up until around the election.; The value proposition is clearly in the autonomous navigation and not the cars themselves.

The trucking industry makes $1T/year in revenue alone.   Wheres that money gonna go when you don't need truck drivers; Exactly, Tesla to 25 trillion market cap by EOY.; really is astonishing how little research people actually do in here. Energy storage, FSD v13, Optimus and the confluence of tech leading to rapid advancements in the area of humanoid robotics, DOJO and cortex, the economics of an autonous robotaxi network... calling Tesla a car company is like calling Amazon a bookstore; This is a quote out of a press interview!; No one is arguing that.  What are are arguing is generally speaking,  stocks do not go up like that vertically day after day.  Which means the correction will be as brutal.; [removed]; I think today they announced, to raise the price about 5000$.; I would say you're absurd but it's not *that* crazy...; Stranger things man.; He gave the same recommendation 3 years ago, end of '21: TSLA  will fare great in 2022. So bullish.

TSLA tanked by 30%.

If people would look at what analysts said in the past and not only what they say about the future, analysts would be out of their job.; He is not much better than a coin flip tho although that is what most analysts have.

[https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/daniel-ives](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/daniel-ives); Maybe because it's wind from an asshole? 😁🤷🏻‍♂️; Oh yeah?  He's stupid.; The thesis is that corruption is out in the open and the American voters are in on it. Elon will get whatever he wants. So will Peter Thiel. 

Not financial advise.; 2024 unit sales will be flat at best and it doesn’t matter. If it wasn’t for BS leases to move units the comp would be negative.; My understanding is they will remove nhsta crash data and let them just start using their autonomous driving even if it’s completely shit. On the other side they seem to make money from selling regulatory credits if I’m not mistaken and cyber truck sales data is not good; Yeah I see more upside for TSLA in other recent news, such as the downfall of VW, or GM giving up on Cruise. I think the election is bullish in that it removes the previous administration which was hostile to TSLA, but beyond that I don't see the concrete benefits. There are even bad aspects like Elon being distracted by DOGE and getting the company even more embroiled in partisan politics.; Look in 4 years when another government comes in and wants electric vehicles and pushes for cleaner world. Tesla would be an even bigger giant as ford/GM will be even further. Have to look at the bigger picture.; Overall volume of EV’s will never shrink. They are the future.  EV technology is still in its infancy.  Gasoline cars will shrink until they’re all but gone from consumer use. Diesel will stick around for quite a while in commercial use, but 90% of the cars on the road will be electric in 25 years.  

Pulling the ladder up from under them will give Tesla a massive advantage for years to come.  Tesla is one of the only manufacturers selling their vehicles at a profit.  Nearly every legacy manufacturer and every startup is still selling their EV’s at a loss in the US.  As ICE market share dies, so will legacy auto.  The only ones who can compete and probably do it at a better price point are NIO and maybe Xpeng, who guess what, are going to be hit with huge tariffs if they ever want to sell in the US. 

Tesla cars in the US are going to be as ubiquitous as iPhones.  In 5-10 years we could start seeing 7-8m Tesla’s sold in the US annually.; Irrationality adds up quick; Considering buying puts. Throwing money out of the windows seems safer than shorting/shorting calls; I look at all the posts of people who have tried.  I definitely wouldn't touch it either way until the inauguration at a bare minimum.  I wasn't expecting another 8-10% today ; This exactly. If Elon has a seat at the table at the top of government, Tesla becomes impossible to value once you price in self-dealing.

Of course, if he gets sent to the kids table some of that evaporates.

It's a wildly speculative... (*checks notes*) $1.5T company?; TX folks aint buying green cars; Wow, it's blatant corruption. 

Just route people's taxes to musk's bank account. This can eliminate lots of government employees, DOGE!; You mean like the pharma industry wasn‘t responsible for any side effects under the corrupt left wing regiment in covid years? You mean this type of corruption? Right?; It does most things well and some things extremely poorly. Unfortunately for driving one split-second mistake can absolutely ruin your day.


* Sometimes it doesn't let people merge over, ruining a zipper merge.
* It struggles to see in the dark.
* It doesn't respect bus only or turn only lanes.
* If Tesla nav messes up, it's going to follow bad directions like getting off the highway only to get on again.
* It frequently stops about a second too late and slams the brakes like it didn't see a light.
* Sometimes it just guns the acceleration in stop/go traffic, again resulting in a harsh ride.
* Sometimes it takes turns just a little too fast.


Anyway, lots more but yeah as someone who uses it a lot FSD still has a long way to go.; WSJ (2 days ago): [The Hidden Autopilot Data That Reveals Why Teslas Crash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUGh0qAqWA)

Level 2 and 3 autonomous driving encourages complacency, which means the drivers are surprised (and sometimes, killed) with the systems fail. 

Humans remain far better at rotating objects in our mind, like overturned trucks or T intersections, than any machine learning system. And our eyes are much more sensitive than cameras, particularly at night.

Selling a semi-autonomous vehicle without LIDAR should be regarded as criminal fraud.

And aside from that video, the duration of uninterrupted drives with FSD isn't growing particularly fast. I'd expect viable consumer systems perhaps in the late 2030s. We'll know they've arrived when insurers offer discounts for drivers that routinely use FSD. At present, high insurance rates are one of the drivers behind high ownership costs for Teslas.; It works well until it doesn't.

Any tech that does most of the job for you but requires you to supervise isn't going to work at scale. People will get bored and naturally quit paying attention (or even fall asleep), and in a speeding car you really can't do that.

There are hundreds of videos of Tesla's driving into clearly marked obstacles, like a fallen semi trailer or pulled over police cruiser with emergency lights on (or even small children), because the AI hasn't had training with that exact shape before so would drive full speed into it. Too many people have died this way to say it works extremely well.; Because you are sitting there supervising it and taking all the risk financially when it doesn’t work.  You might as well drive.; I think it gets down to a combination things:  the error rate, the severity of an error, and the scale of operation. If a human has to pump the brakes once to avoid a collision in ten hours of driving, then that's a very low error rate and an amazing technical feat. You could make all kinds of youtube videos about how incredible it is. And it truly is incredible. Our family had a rotary phone when I was a child, and now we are living in the future.

But that means in the absence of a human in the loop, there would be one accident for every 10 hours of road time.

So what if Tesla gets that down to one accident-avoiding active intervention per 1,000 hours of drive time? Even more incredible.

But if there are a thousand Teslas operating autonomously, then that's one accident per hour. There are a heck of a lot more than a thousand Teslas in operation, so consider what kind of an error rate they need to have to avoid causing a newsworthy accident every single day. And remember these can be life-altering or life-ending. The stakes are high.

Tesla fans rave about all the miles of driving data they have, but the bulk of those miles are probably driving in a straight line staying between painted lane markings and behind the car in front. It's the edge cases and weird things that need to be dealt with. You need lots of redundency. You need lots of guardrails. You need maps and lots of sensors and different kinds of sensors to get the insanely low error rates needed to operate at scale without killing people on a regular basis.

Waymo is out there doing now what Tesla has been talking about doing for years. My gut tells me that waymo's accident rate is going to be well below Tesla's if they both go head-to-head in the robotaxi market. Even if both are below the accident rate of a human, I expect Tesla's rate will be higher  because of the technical roadmap they adopted (vision only, operate without detailed mapping). I will wait an extra few minutes for a Waymo.; Most people have no idea. They just hate Elon, click on every headline that says Musk or Tesla and repeat the nonsense other Elon haters told them. I guess this is the swarm intelligence everybody talks about. Lol. ; There's not really any mapping for FSD. It works everywhere. However, sometimes there are some disagreements between the navigation based on Google Maps and FSD, which they seem to be getting under control better lately. Perhaps they will create their own navigation system based on all the driving data they get. The goal for Tesla is to tackle the specific scenarios in which FSD makes mistakes, which seems to be getting exponentially smaller. 

Although Waymo is currently ahead of Tesla, it has a scaling problem, and it's just as (or more) expensive as an Uber. Tesla robotaxi should be much cheaper, and can work all over the US from one day to the other with a software update.; No I'm totally down for TSLA because there will be tangible value. Right now it's trading like crypto; What exactly do you mean by ""next election""?; He'll probably back Warren Jeff's candidacy to legalize polygamy and be announced a prophet by the state church.; From your lips to god’s ear’s 🙏 

😂; If TSLA could displace a significant portion of truckers in the US with autonomous navigators making those truckers full salary, their valuation still wouldn't be justified.

There is no value proposition, it is just momentum, Elon, and FOMO. Over thanksgiving people who did not even know how to use their brokerage app were asking me for help buying TSLA shares.; What a fanboi; How many of these are pet projects that generate no revenue?; Then why does everyone only care about the number of cars sold when they do ERs?; [removed]; The numbers I see say Tesla is down to 48% of the electric market share in the US.

I encourage you to go to youtube and watch videos of FSD v13.2. Do your own research and make up your own mind; because wall street has historically always lagged behind on revolutionary tech and a lot of the people that cover Tesla are auto analysts and have no understanding of it. Go back and look at what they were saying when Apple released the iPhone, or about Amazon and AWS, or NVIDIA when anybody that was paying attention could see the AI transition that was taking place but Nvidia was nothing more than a gaming company until that big quarter where it finally showed up in revenues.

Don't take my word for it though. Look over the last 4 quarters of earnings and listen to the conference calls. Look at how rapidly energy storage is growing and they just completed another megapack factory in China that's gonna start shipping units in Q1 next year. Go to youtube and watch videos of FSD v13.2 and Optimus. Research the other robotics companies like FigureAI and look who's investing in them. Run the thought experiments in your head about what it really means if a $30,000 car can drive itself.

104,2.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks,"I bought the dip on several 'pandemic stocks' that had significant declines (70%+) in 2022 and started sharing public updates 1-2 times a year.

In Q3 2023 I began reallocating into AI-related stocks when I developed strong conviction. I'm also working on a self-funded AI startup, which keeps me in the loop on AI.

Returns have been strong and continue to give me the runway to work on my startup and support my family after leaving my corporate tech job. There's more context in my previous updates linked below.

(*\*) Short term capital gain/loss held for <1yr*

I held several companies (\*) for a short time to spread out my AI bets, but some of the increasingly high P/E ratios concerned me (PLTR, TSLA, etc.).

So, I sold them and purchased more NVIDIA. This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects.

In this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off.

To clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change.

Meta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation.

# Unrealized (current investments)

* **Meta (META):** \+367.97%
* **Nvidia (NVDA):** \+117.05%

Nvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up \~200% since I initially purchased it last year after dithering for months.

These returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it.

# Rate of return (IRR)

My annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is **73.6%**.

# Investment thesis

See a summary of my investment thesis in a [previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/). **TL;DR:**

>“…AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways.

>The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the \~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among [other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/).”

# Nvidia's dominance

I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:

* Nvidia is [founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/) and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.
* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.
* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.
* AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).
* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.

# We still underestimate the AI opportunity

Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.

We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.

# Final thoughts

I'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/) I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from.

I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.

**UPDATE:** Thanks for mentioning I should have included indexes for benchmark context. Indexes like QQQ and S&P 500 also had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024). For an apples to apples comparison, the IRR of QQQ and S&P 500 respectively during this period were \~24% and \~16%.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hfjvh8/25_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/,832,2024-12-16 15:08:16,"What data points make you think AI has more to offer than incremental improvements over where we are at today?; For whatever reason i decided to put everything into Peloton around that time.

Needless to say I dont buy stocks anymore; Lol this is insane performance, but half the comments are on your ass because they don’t get the difference between annualized and cumulative return; My total rate of return for 2022 to 2024 is 96% doing nothing but buying QQQ; For reference the S&P was up 58% in the same period (w/dividends reinvested), with near zero tax consequences.

Edit: Since it needs to be clarified… the reference is to express how buy and hold would have preformed. It’s not right or wrong, it’s a reference point.; Now you need to calculate the taxes you had to pay doing this trading and calculate your total return.
Investing is about your total return after everything including taxes.; Great play. I’m sure you outperformed the market by a ton during this regardless of taxes. What made you want to sell some of your big winners? What do you think of Reddit stock right now?; Quick question on Nvidia. A lot of the hyperscalers (e.g. Amazon) have mentioned their own ambitions to build their own GPUs. These hyperscalers also happen to be big cutsomers of Nvidia. What are your thoughts on hyperscalers developing their own hardware and competing with Nvidia? Congrats on your results btw. A lot of good names in the portfolio; You sold GOOGL & AMZN? Why?; I share your sentiment on $NVDA. I’m in tech, both as a founder of several businesses and investor. Almost every startup I see is doing something with AI and all the large mega-businesses are too. 

Granted there is some absolute non-sense happening with investments and startups, but AI is going to revolutionize everything we do. 

I’m in other non-AI investments but my AI strategy is to invest on the hardware side (NVDA, TSM, SOXL and even some AMD) and on the content side (RDDT). AI is driven by human content and Reddit is the greatest source of that right now.; If it takes off, I’ll get it from the index.  Less risky that way.  I made a 40% return on single stocks then diversified because the odds were not on my side that I could keep it up.; > Below are the returns for this portfolio (opened in 2022) as of December 2024.
Realized (sold) in 2023

> Carvana (CVNA): +845.57%

Would you mind sharing how you got +845% if you acquired in 2022 and sold in 2023? Looking at the performance, CVNA was high but on its was down in 2022, and did not recover significantly until 2024.; This is the best post! Thanks for the transparency. Forgot about peloton. Rip Covid wave; You must be one of the few that made money selling Unity.... Only booking a small loss on Snapchat is good as well, one of my worst investments.; I’d say we’re actually wildly overestimating AI.; That’s not an “investing thesis”. That was gambling and it sometimes works. Right now you are in the Dunning-Kruger effect zone.; Looking at some of these and I think ""damn, I shouldn't have got nervous. I should have bought some of these like Meta and amazon and Netflix"".; I'm bullish for chips/semi-conductors.

Nearly every piece of technology that's not a calculator will be running on these materials and technology will only get more complex and dynamic. 

Think of the future in 15-20 years, are we going to see less or more?

More. A Lot more.; Congrats! Great job.

Thoughts on ASML?; I would highly recommend to wait until our President is in office and the tariffs are in place along with the mass deportations.  This could highly cause the market to correct 

I’m my opinion, majority of the stocks have very high pe’s that are not justified Not worth buying right now. 

Need a major correction the stock’s values!!!!!!!!; Taking on additional risk can amplify returns in a bull market and losses in a bear market.  Getting higher returns is impressive, unless it's done via outsized risk.  Do you quantify risk in your portfolio?  How do you assess your risk?; just for comparison, S&P 500 on June 1 2022 was 3899 and today its 6063.79 so that's 

6063.79/3899^(1/[2+6.5/12])=1.19 which means an annualized 19% ROI over the same period. So like 1/3 of the OP

edit: oh didn't see the end of your post, weird that your number for S&P ROI is so much higher though; What stocks do you think will have similar growth in the next 5 years?; This is basically better version of gambling imo, but why not do it if it's working for you; Curious why you sold TSM. Are you concerned about competition ? Or threat of Chinese attack on Taiwan?; Why are you selling stocks like Amazon/Google and what are you buying selling those?; What do you think of Intel's new arc b series GPUs? While not as powerful as nvdas top tier, they're like half the cost of their NVDA comparisons. In your opinion does this not eat into their most? Will AI for the foreseeable future always default to the most powerful product?; What are your thoughts on $SOXX, the semiconductor ETF? Do you any of the other microchip companies going to catch up to the performance of Nvidia?; [deleted]; You should calculate and compare your geometric return (aka growth rate) not IRR. This is more commonly how portfolio returns are looked at. I would also compare your return to a more simple passive portfolio over 3-5 years to see how you did compared to the market.; We all did this…and?; In your initial comments you mentioned you were in all cash anticipating the recession. What made you pull the trigger to go to all cash. I keep getting tempted over the years to cash out and try to 'time' the market but then never do.; I’m -98% on all birds lol; Nancy Pelosi did better.; My portfolio of magic internet money is up 228% since going all in in 2021. 

Diversification is so old world to me.; Jesus you sux at picking stocks.....you just go on YouTube and search for whatever reddit and YouTubers are shilling and buy it?; I got 1000% returns on bc so what; Up 250% off Microstrategy shares only. Microstrategy has outperformed everything, including Nvidia, at every time frame, and this gap will only widen in the coming 12 months.; That’s not a lot! I make that in a day; This is interesting I will look into it; The answer to that question is overdetermined and IMO easier to answer the other way. The 'ChatGPT moment' when AI entered the public consciousness and investment meaningfully increased was \~2 years ago.

Given past technological advancements, do we think we're near the end of what possible after two years or the beginning?

That's where I'd start. Working in the industry, talking to folks and watching what others are building reinforces this. For example, just about every scientist and research I've talking to is excited because we're just scratching the surface of what's possible.

For consumer examples, look at the videos Sora is creating (I recently got access to it). It has a long way to go, but I can imagine the possibilities. For example, imagine coming home and wanting to watch a new sequel of <your favorite franchise here>, but on a different timeline/scenario and just asking AI to generate it. How much would you pay for that? What about for a custom, fully immersive VR video game?

And that's just the world of bits. Move to the world of atoms and imagine robots trained to fix/build anything and do anything around the home, to train you how to improve your swing, etc. What if you could learn anything with a dedicated tutor? That's all possible with AI. How much economic value is that in the US and around the world?

I use it multiple times a day, every day. It's great, but still has a lot to improve on even in the scope of daily life. But as it becomes better, faster and cheaper it'll increase by orders of magnitude in usefulness.; Well we don't have: 

* Ambient Intelligence (AI in the Air)
* AI-Powered Molecular Fabrication (AI for Instant Objects)
* AI-Driven Health Guardians
* AI-Enhanced Education
* Biological Integration (AI in our Bodies)

Machine Learning & AI as it exists today is an infant. It is way too rough around the edges to use in real big business, in high leverage situations, especially with regulations in place.; The acceleration of AI is just beginning, and the pace is off the charts. It may appear as though it has slowed down, but that’s because the next area of focus is adding reasoning to LLMs and robotics.

I think we will see a breakthrough in Tesla for full self-driving cars where you can just sleep to your next destination. That’s a big deal and would change everything once that’s widespread. AI robots in the workplace will also become a reality soon. And can you imagine what quantum computing will do for all of this? 

Companies would not be pouring BILLIONS into AI if they didn’t expect a return on their investment. We *always* hit limits on technology and slow down… and then we break through.; Point of clarification - we have Generative AI, which is not actual AI. The difference is massive.; I was briefly optimistic about them too, but thankfully didn’t buy much. Did the same with Carvana and hit the lottery so 🤷‍♂️ Just shows how much is luck at times.; Honestly you deserve it for not diversifying and looking for a Hail Mary. Stay away from the market if thats your relationship with it. Or. Start buying Etfs now and future you will thank you immensely.; My gme is about to pop off!; You did it wrong. I bought at IPO and made ~$27k on a $5k investment. Sold at exactly the one year mark for long term gains.; Heh thanks. It’s always something it seems. It amuses me to look at other negative comments on my past update posts over the last couple years.

This series originally started from a comment on hacker news in 2022, so you can imagine how that went 😆; His is annual lol i swear you people dint read; Mag7 have done super well over that time period, so yeah. 

But OP had 73 percent annual return for each of the 2.5 years, which is a lot higher than 96 percent.; This. Bro is out here with a manifesto during/after a crazy bull run where you can pretty much buy anything and isn't even outperforming the index.; Yes, indexes like QQQ and S&P 500 had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024), but what you shared isn't IRR. For apples to apples, the IRR of QQQ and S&P 500 respectively during this period were \~16% and \~24%.; Watch the vocal minority of this sub that worships VOO cry at this comment; Check out TQQQ; > My total rate of return for 2022 to 2024 is 96% doing nothing but buying QQQ

Nice story. He did way better than you. Can you read?; Literally same here. With $SPY as well!; No, the IRR (annualized rate of return) of the S&P 500 during the same was closer to 16%.

But you're right, a benchmark for comparison would be be helpful, so I added it in an update at the bottom. Thank you for the callout.; Yeah I’d be curious how this plays out when you look at net position post taxes. (Which is all that really matters).

 Looks like OP exposed themselves to a lot of extra risk over something boring like CDA into an index fund, for relatively minimal additional benefit. ; Annually, or total?; How are taxes different for SPY?; Quote annual if op is quoting annual; > For reference the S&P was up 58% in the same period (w/dividends reinvested), with near zero tax consequences.

Also for reference, snow is white.; This; Thank you!

>What made you want to sell some of your big winners?

Things felt overvalued after the post-election rally. Nvidia and Meta had the most attractive valuations relative to their market positions (especially if there's a correction) as well as the most long-term upside, so I held them.

Plus feeling they were overvalued was just nagging in the back of my mind, so pulling the trigger to sell them also freed up some mental cycles, which is valuable in itself.

I still believe in most of those companies (especially Tesla, Palantir, etc.) but the relative valuation just felt high.

I'll certainly miss some short-term upside, but I'm hoping to make up for it long-term.

>What do you think of Reddit stock right now?

Sorry, I don't have an opinion on it since it's not in my area of expertise. I've learned (the hard way) to only invest in what I know deeply, thus where I have an advantage.; Yeah, I have questions there too. Amazon for example now has their Trainum 2 chips in GA promising better price performance, whith Trainium 3 chips coming next summer. This will cut into Nvidia's market share at the low end, as AWS' goal is always to commoditize infra. Google also has its own TPUs it uses.

But they and all other hyperscalers still use Nvidia's GPUs as well due to the unmatched versatility and ecosystem. Where the balance settles is still a big question.

The more negative case for Nvidia is if somehow we reach the limits GPU scaling on all fronts (e.g. even o1's economics don't scale, which is unlikely), in which case GPUs become more commoditized to the extent that the other aspects of their moat (CUDA, ecosystem, networking, etc.) can't make up for it.

However, I don't think that is the case. I'm also curious how large sovereign AI becomes in the coming years.

Long-term I'd expect Nvidia's market share to settle around \~70% (from \~90% today for datacenter AI GPUs). But even if competitors catch up and it drops to 50% I believe the market will be massive enough to achieve attractive returns.; * **GOOGL:** Relatively slow growth, relatively unexciting near term prospects, search cash cow threatened by Open AI and others.
* **AMZN:** P/E is about the same as NVDA with much less growth.

To be clear, I'm optimistic about the long-term prospects for both companies, but I opted to double down where I had the most conviction and anticipated the most upside.; I agree. I still feel like we've yet to deep though and there may well be a short-term bust as the superficial ones wash out.

But building applications myself, talking to scientists, etc. it's incredible just how many more ways there  are to use it that'll be immensely beneficial. It'll just take time since the world also has to reconfigure around these things, just how the world reconfigured for roads and automobiles, electricity, the internet, etc.

What gives me hope is the awareness around AI since the public and government seem increasingly excited about it, which seems to be overcoming the initial fear -- at least to the extent the government understands it can't outlaw it and much embrace it to be competitive.; I had to look it up. Bought CVNA 12/14/2022 and sold 9/11/2023.

I hadn't looked at it since I sold, but looking now I missed out on a **ton** of upside. However, I was focused on the short-term recovery, not the longer term business prospects since that business isn't my wheelhouse and I had more conviction in AI, so reallocated into Nvidia. You win some you lose some I guess.; We shall see. Maybe possible in the short-term, but unlikely long-term.; I've been reading Stratechery, a tech/business analyst for almost a decade, which I credit for building my understanding of the industry. He has really strong analysis that helped me see through the market noise (voting machine vs. weighing machine) and make clear headed investment decisions on those.

My biggest regret is not following through on buying Nvidia in late 2022 at its bottom before the AI boom after he [analyzed its prospects](https://stratechery.com/2022/nvidia-in-the-valley/). This is after I had already went all-in on the pandemic stocks, thus didn't have a lot of extra cash at the time. About a year later is when I started selling the pandemic stocks to buy Nvidia and other AI stocks.

What I love most about his analysis is that he's not a stock picker, which keeps his analysis clear and unbiased. He just analyses the companies in the context of the industry and gives his analysis. He has a genuine love for the industry and analysis, which makes ability unmatched.; QQQM; ehm
Calculators in fact do run on semiconductors, too.; Not for me. Stratechery had a great summary on it. A quote from his article [TSMC Earnings, Margins and Arizona, ASML and Peak Lithography](https://stratechery.com/2024/tsmc-earnings-margins-and-arizona-asml-and-peak-lithography/):

>That leaves TSMC and its upcoming investment at 2nm and 16A, which is a challenge for ASML for three reasons. First, there is the aforementioned shift in TSMC’s model; repurposing equipment likely means fewer lithography orders. Second, while ASML may have a monopoly on advanced lithography, TSMC is poised to have monopsony power in terms of being able to actually make money on processes that utilize ASML’s advanced lithography, which may depress prices (this is the third factor that could help TSMC’s margins). The third challenge is that we are past peak lithography.

From Doug O’Laughlin at [Fabricated Knowledge](https://www.fabricatedknowledge.com/p/earnings-tsmc-asml-aehr-telecom):

>Another way to interrupt this statement is that EUV intensity is peaked if they think the DUV attach rate is growing as fast as EUV. This has been a long time coming, and Applied Materials puts it well in this slide – 3nm is the apex of lithography market share gains. This is not good for ASML and the EUV story.

>...

>The last decade has been the decade of Lithography, and I can almost assure you that Lithography spending will grow slower in the next decade than WFE \[Wafer Fab Equipment\]. And let’s not forget that in the decade before EUV, lithography was only 15-20% of the expenditure. I believe that lithography will revert to the mid-20s of WFE.

>I think it’s time for investors to accept the decade of lithography is over. The premium ASML has slowly gained for itself for the last decade should end as the decade of litho ends. And the recent price move has been a collapse of that premium. I believe it should trade in line with other semi-cap companies, as I’m sure that Litho will not outgrow WFE but will be valued for its strong monopoly.

It's still continue to be a good business, but not a great one that is likely to produce outsized returns.; Similar to how stocks sharply rose after the years of inflation, whatever the tariffs do will also increase the stocks eventually. Increase in revenue due to more expensive items will increase the stocks eventually price.; I agree. I trust my gut and don't do any kind of sophisticated analysis around balancing risk. I try to focus on overall fundamentals and long-term trends.

It's also why in the update I felt the need to say I'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. I could be that guy who jumps off a building and halfway down says, ""So far, so good!"" 🫠; Nice catch, I accidentally swapped the respective returns for S&P 500 and QQQ, just fixed it. I asked ChatGPT to calculate it since I was rushing trying to respond to most comments -- getting sloppy. Thank you for catching that.; I'm holding the ones I have the most conviction in given the current valuation. Though, I believe the Mag7 and tech generally will continue to grow long-term.; Nope, still bullish on them, just saw more upside elsewhere.; * **GOOGL:** Relatively slow growth, relatively unexciting near term prospects, search cash cow threatened by Open AI and others. That was my reasoning, though Willow and their new AI video gen model came out since then and may have changed my mind.
* **AMZN:** P/E is about the same as NVDA with much less growth.

To be clear, I'm optimistic about the long-term prospects for both companies, but I opted to double down where I had the most conviction and anticipated the most upside.; I think the two big questions are 1) does Intel even have a future and 2) why would anyone buy from Intel?

I don't mean that in a snarky way, but I have legitimate concerns about their future. And those concerns would make would-be chip buyers less likely to invest in chips from them.

Assuming Intel does come out strong, I'm curious how attractive their chips would be compared to 1) hyperscalers like Amazon making their own chips and 2) alternatives like AMD for everyone else.

In terms of desirability, how I see it playing out is those who prioritize training would want the most powerful GPUs for training, then rotate those to inference as they get replaced by better GPUs.

As long as Nvidia is supply constrained, there will be room for competitors. And there will increasingly be demand for more efficient, low powered inference.

So IMO the first question is whether Intel remains viable. Then if they do, how attractive are they to everyone who isn't building their own chips and for what purpose -- as a designer? A fab?

As long as their current board is in place, I don't see much changing for them since in terms of expertise Pat Gelsinger was the best shot they had.

The sad thing about this is if you look at most of the historical innovation in terms of processes, Intel led the way there and TSMC followed. So if Intel dies, I don't know who will pick up the torch. Intel was quite amazing, just a tragedy how they fell.; Not likely. Nvidia has >80% market share and nobody else is even close. Betting on anyone else would be diluting returns IMO.

However I’m looking and fundamentals and qualitative factors. The market is often based on other speculative factors, judging by the valuations of others so I’m not saying it won’t happen short term, just that I wouldn’t bet on it based on what I see.; >You could have achieved a similar return by levering a diversified index

Interesting. Which index achieved a \~70% annual rate of return during that period?

>Ride out a down market with those same stocks and let us know if you’re still outperforming.

Why? My goal is to buy low and sell high. I intentionally bought them at the bottom of the down market. Why would I buy stocks and ride out a down market?

I covered it in a previous update, but prior to the pandemic dip I was largely in cash beginning in late 2021 anticipating a drop. I did the same thing with the '08/'09 recession (in my 20's), though I was more heavily in depressed real estate in addition to stocks.

I go where the opportunities are and that's why I'm all in on AI now. I don't consider it gabling though, I have generally have deep knowledge about what I invest in (in addition to a MS in Finance and an MBA).

Will I always be right? No, but I share transparent updates here and enjoy the feedback and interaction. BTW I really would love to here about the index you're referring to with the \~70% annual return you mentioned.; In late 2021 there were rumblings of billionaire unloading assets, fed policy shifts and increasing inflation. Plus it just felt generally unsustainable since it wasn't clear anything sustainable was driving it. I also listen to a lot of VCs and other investors, who felt the same thing, but stayed in because they were still making money.

Timing the market is hard and I generally don't do it. Even in this case I didn't time it all that well:

1. I was first in indexes, then in cash before the drop so I definitely missed out on some upside.
2. It was 7 months of ups and down (mostly down) until I was consistently in the green. I'd be lying if I said I didn't question my decisions during that time, but I kept buying more companies as they bottomed out if they had good fundamentals (with a few exceptions, which were a mixed back, but up overall).

I think the hardest part of investing is understanding your own psychology enough to have the right discipline. If you can do that, then it's easier to take in a lot of data sources, ignore the noise (see most comments here and talking heads on TV), and make your own decisions.

It also helps that I learned lessons and built discipline, patience and instincts during the last recession. With this one I didn't invest more than I could afford to lose. And as my returns grew, I could invest more since I was just risking my returns.

Lastly, I also knew I was investing for the long-term, which allowed me to be patient and not worry about short-term movements. I still watch the market every day out of interest, but don't trade all that much because long-term trends changes and meaningful new information don't happen that often.

Lastly, the only way to outperform the market is to be contrarian and right. So by definition, you have to ignore what most people are saying, but also have enough judgement to know if you're informed enough to do that. There's also no doubt luck plays a big factor in many aspects.; 😆; Very nice. I know nothing about Microstrategy so for me it’d be gambling. I stick to what I know deeply for alpha.; I work at the #1 cloud provider in the AI industry with leading AI research firms and I think we are hitting the limits of the transformer architecture. New model benchmarks (e.g., Amazon Nova) are providing marginal improvements at best while pre-training and fine tuning costs remain very high (multiple millions for just fine-tuning). The underlying technical limitation of the architecture will limit the apps built on top (video gen, autonomous agents, etc.). If all the economy gets for this investment are copilots and customer service chatbots, then that is valuable but not a game-changer.; Have a look at the Gartner hype cycle. That's what tends to happen with new areas and often also the related stocks. You can see parallels in any number of industry leaps forward (smartphones, the internet, streaming services, electric cars); [deleted]; > For example, imagine coming home and wanting to watch a new sequel of <your favorite franchise here>, but on a different timeline/scenario and just asking AI to generate it. How much would you pay for that?


I'm not saying there _isn't_ a market for this, but I wouldn't pay anything for that.


Honestly, I'm kind of disappointed in your answer. It doesn't actually answer the question you were asked.


You provided no data points to suggest there are more than incremental updates remaining.


> Move to the world of atoms and imagine ...


This is literally the opposite of a data point.; > For example, imagine coming home and wanting to watch a new sequel of <your favorite franchise here>, but on a different timeline/scenario and just asking AI to generate it. How much would you pay for that?


I can't tell you how awful this sounds. The end of endings is a change in thinking I'm not sure people are ready for or need.


Like, the MCU multiverse arc is garbage. If anything is possible, nothing matters. Character is dead? They're alive again with zero effort. I am checked out of that series because there is no emotional investment. Why would I bother to watch something that has no ending? I am watching it to find out _how it ends_. I want satisfaction. Or dissatisfaction. Some finality. 


I guess it kind of works for soap operas? But like, you watch those to discuss them, to at least see some storylines end. And who wants to talk about what your individual machine hallucinated for you? Will anyone else care? ; You ever been playing a great video game, struggling your way thru it but having a good time. Then you find some cheat codes, have a BLAST one night trying everything you didn’t think was possible before, but after that have no desire to play the game because it’s lost all its original charm now that there’s no constraints in the game?  That’s like opening up your own world to using Ai for everything; I want to upvote the amazing satire of ""AI in the air"" but I don't think you're joking..; My friend said the same:

It’s a nothing burger; “This” while unable to read lol; Yes, indexes like QQQ and S&P 500 also had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024). But for an apples to apples comparison, the IRR of QQQ and S&P 500 respectively during this period were \~16% and \~24% compared to \~73% for mine.

I believe the error is u/rcbjfdhjjhfd states 'total rate of return' but confuses total return with rate of return (IRR).; > This. Bro is out here with a manifesto during/after a crazy bull run where you can pretty much buy anything and isn't even outperforming the index.

The fact that this comment has 159 upvotes makes this subreddit seem pretty idiotic and jealous; And what was yours annualized? 

This comparison seems like the most relevant data point to share; He made edits after my comment. I don’t have a Time Machine or the interest in editing my comment.; What are you buying today? 

What signal will change your mind on Nvda and Meta?; Taxes were relatively small, particularly because most of my sales qualified for long-term capital gains.

Maybe I misunderstand what you mean by 'relatively minimal additional benefit'. An annualized return of over 70% is 3X-5X what indexes like S&P 500 and Nasdaq earned during that same period.; Total… same period of time in question.

I only mention this because the figures being presented need a comparison to something with market risk.

Edit: Since it needs to be clarified… the reference is to express how buy and hold would have preformed. It’s not right or wrong, it’s a reference point.; I imagine that if he would've held on to S&P, he would've not paid all the taxes he did pay when he sold a bunch of stocks during the past years, and will have to pay again with the new realized gains, but someone smarter would have to confirm if this is accurate.; Thanks for your thoughtful response. I agree with your thinking and am considering selling some winners (including Reddit) myself right now. At this point I’m up so much in the past 2 or 3 months I almost feel like I’m cool with missing some upside to lock in my gains; Reddit is heavy on AI forward thinking. Not sure how you don't have expertise in it, if so. Then they have the meta advertising style revenue as one of if not their primary base.

Are you looking at any other individual names to open a long position?; Man all you smart people using llms to work efficiently and I'm an ai developer doing manual math like a chump; [deleted]; What is the underlying technical limitations? I don’t think anyone really knows how any of this works.  You could describe in terms matrix algebra/calculus description but that doesn’t really explain why it works. A new architecture or breakthrough will come along that speeds development, training, something else who knows, it consistently has.  It was the transformer with RLHF that had the biggest impact I thought. In ~5 years students may be training ChatGPT 4 level agents for college projects.  There will be a company that wraps a sora like model with another deep learning algorithm that optimizes videos pixel by pixel to grab users attention as strongly as possible.  ; All you’ve done is build the road to the gold mine and open the ground; AWS I assume? Still bigger than GCP and Azure I think, though I believe Azure might be seeing more AI demand due to OpenAI? Either way, you have an incredible vantage point on the industry.

This might be true, but o1 has shown us new opportunities for scaling. We still may also see improvements to pre-training with more scale, synthetic data, etc. but I'm not holding my breath for that. However, I do expect improvements with efficiency and optimization of models. Suffice to say that scaling compute isn't the only way to improve.

I'm also excited because I believe we've barely scratched the surface of where we can even implement the current state of AI into the existing economy. E.g. let's assume AI models don't improve at all, there's still 5+ years of progress we could make by efficiently implementing what we have today --  especially as more people get better at understanding how to use it. Though this would shift the focus to inference from training and have implications, but I'm still optimistic.

In a nutshell given that AI is effectively intelligence, my core assumption is that we're more likely to underestimate the impact than overestimate it -- especially given Nvidia's still reasonable P/E ratio (51 as of right now) with supply constraints.

We shall see. I'll continue to share periodic updates on the bets I've made.; Who do you see as the most competitive company in the cloud space? Is Google really making a dent?; If you truly believe that the transformer is only to be applied to customer service chatbots and coding copilots then you sincerely lack imagination.

Look at Waymo, look at Tesla, look at Recursion Pharmaceuticals, look at Palantir, look at BigBear, look at RedCat. There are hundreds of examples of *current* explorations of AI beyond just being a chatbot.

This is just the beginning. The real boon here will be the spilling over of AI into other domains and those unrealized gains are undetermined and difficult to predict, but it’s already begun and I expect it to continue. Very few people beyond research scientists give a shit about the benchmarks everyone harps over. The most important part IMO is how will AI be applied in non-technological domains.; I’m familiar with it, but AI isn’t a new area. What changed is that it finally ‘worked’ enough for people to care. AI has been worked on for decades.

I get your point though, just wanted to clarify where my bullishness comes from in part.; Not OP, but with a good baseline prompt, including telling it to ask clarifying and continuing questions to keep a back-and-forth going, it can be useful to essentially “think out loud” on some problems or ideas that you don’t have fully fleshed out but hit mental road blocks on, or need to find vocabulary for something you might not have. But I as well don’t use it nearly every day, more like a couple times a month.; I most often use it in place of Google for asking questions, looking things up, research, etc. I also take screenshots of things and ask for analysis. A random use case: I'm color blind, so I'll take a picture of clothes and ask if they match -- before buying clothes, matching clothes to wear, etc.

At my startup I'm the CEO and mostly do product, so I don't code much, but I have used it for code.

I also use it for translations (e.g. when doing customer support for non-english speakers).

Our startup uses it as part of our core technology, but we still have a long ways to go -- and so does AI in terms of quality, speed and cost, to be more useful.

I also use it with my kids when they occasionally ask things I don't know when we're driving.

For me it's insane how useful it is and I'd easily pay 10X what I pay for it now ($20/mo) for the same capabilities.

I've never used it to reply to an email.; Ok.; Some people like MCU, others like Duck Dynasty, others like the Housewives reality shows, others like documentaries, others love anything from Disney and Pixar, etc.

I love movies, but rarely discuss them with anyone as it seems you do, so that won't matter for me. And if I could, I'd be watching Sicario sequel #103 tonight, or maybe Iron Man #17 or John Wick #347 because I love the characters and that those kinds of films. Even better, instead of generating a movie to watch, I'd want to 'play' the storyline in a dynamically AI generated VR world, which is even a few steps behind full-length movies.

The point isn't really about what **you** like specifically, but rather anyone can have whatever they like, no matter what it is because the cost of creating it will be near zero -- just whatever compute cycles it takes to generate combined with whatever IP you decide to use (license), whether you want t own or rent it, share it with others (to maybe make a few bucks), etc.

Not everyone will want to create and that's fine, but those who do now can. Just like ever improving smartphone cameras made more people take pictures, how Garage Band, etc. helped more people make music, and how WordPress. made more people bloggers/amateur journalists/writers, etc. It's about democratization, and technology moves every upwards towards higher levels of abstraction. And you can choose to consume what they make or not.

Today the constraint is that tremendous investment has to be made in one thing from one director. But tomorrow, everyone can be a director. Yes, the average quality will go down, but it doesn't matter. It only matters that 1) it's possible and 2) some people will want it.; Definitely not.

To suggest that we are going to only incrementally improve the AI technology when all we really have now is large language models is silliness.

There is going to be so much more.; Not too be confused with TLDR; Yeah people are confusing your 73% rate of return with total return; Average redditor comprehension level.; Then also write your total return bro. Must be close to 200%; It is literally one of the headlines in the post.; I think you’re correct. I would go a step further and say risk adjusted returns are all that matter.; Mine annualized was 73.6%. I added an update to the bottom of the post with the benchmarks for the same period.; >What signal will change your mind on Nvda and Meta?

I doubt it'd be a specific signal since I developed conviction over a long period of time from many signals. But some examples of things that'd change my mind about the future (and would prompt an underwear change 💩😆):

* **Nvidia:** They are no longer supply constrained, particularly if it's due to something pointing to permanently reduced demand like significantly limited returns from GPU scaling.
* **Meta:** They stop seeing returns from implementing AI in ads and see an extended period of reduced or stagnant impression growth resulting in increasingly higher ad prices (counterintuitive, but points to limited future opportunities). Another one might be Apple launching a new wearable that's comparable to Meta's Orion, which points to Apple owning the next platform paradigm, like they did with the iPhone. Another might be some regulation around AI that outlaws their Llama model.

It could be a number of things, but more broadly anything that meaningfully points to AI not being the meaningful trend I think it is. That's not to say there won't be bubbles, busts or that Nvidia/Meta won't have meaningful short-term corrections, but that happens -- I've been investing long enough to be comfortable with those.

>What are you buying today?

Today I actually bought a small amount of SMCI again since they dropped due to the Nasdaq delisting and are still depressed from issues due to their reporting.

But it’s risky since things still seem fishy and it’s more akin to gambling than I’m typically comfortable with, so I only purchased small amount.

I decided to take a chance since their sales still seem strong, but doubt I’ll hold it long term since it’s not a high conviction bet for me, I'm just playing the short-term volatility after watching it for months.

I don't have any plans to buy anything else, but I rarely do. I mostly just trade based on whenever I get new information or valuations change enough to buy/sell, which is unpredictable. I generally don't trade very often, so buying SMCI to hold short-term is unusual for me.; Risk-adjusted (post-tax) returns are what you need to look at. ; Well if OPs figures are annual, then that's a great return.; For context, my IRR was \~73% compared to the S&P 500's \~16% during this period. Generally, taxes are a secondary concern with such strong outperformance. Further, the vast majority of my returns qualified for long-term capital gains.; Yes, but just about every major company is AI forward thinking right now. I haven't followed reddit's business for a long time, thus don't know it well.

Meta on the other hand I watched for a long time, including the bust following ATT (when I bought) through their reemergence as an I leader.

A lot goes into it, but I just don't invest in business I don't know well and I don't know reddit well. There's also not enough history as a public company to learn about it yet.; Yes, the news about Willow came out after I sold hah. I don't know if that would have changed my mind though since that's a ways from commercial application. I also stated 'relatively unexciting **near term** prospects' and I don't consider the commercial viability of their quantum computing long-term.

As I said in the original comment I am excited about their long-term prospects, just more excited about the others.; In this portfolio, yes for now. I’ll miss out on some upside, but things felt frothy so I wanted to capitalize on the post-election bump. META and NVDA seemed to have the most reasonable valuation given earnings growth x moats.

Today I bought a small amount of SMCI on the Nasdaq delisting news since they are depressed, but not a long-term thing, just holding until they recover a bit. More just having fun than anything since holding 2 stocks is a bit boring 😆

But I expect to buy others once I feel things are more reasonable.

As always, I could be completely wrong so…; Haha. It used to be awful at math but now it’s pretty good, especially if you tell it to double check it’s work. And man, o1 is just on a different level despite being pretty new. Excited to see where it’ll be in a couple years.; No, I'm specifically asking more about how you achieved a \~70% annual rate of return like I did with your index during that period. Show me as I've shown you.

I share these transparent updates for feedback, to learn and get better. But to value your criticism, I have to know if it's legit or no different than the other negative comments here 💩 That's why I want to know how you did it.

An observation: You seem to imply that I don't follow investing best practices or what most professional investors do. **And you're right.**

But if I did I'd have nothing interesting to share because alpha comes from being contrarian and right. And when I build strong conviction on something, I go all in as I've shown (I did the same in the last recession).

When I don't have strong conviction (which is most of the time), I'm in an index to at least match the market. If I shared these updates while in an index or in cash (as I was before these updates started in 2022), they wouldn't be worth sharing.; Also wondering this.; > given that AI is effectively intelligence

This seems like a strange viewpoint for someone in the industry as opposed to, well, marketing. What we're calling AI now is nothing more than autocomplete. A very powerful form of it, sure, but there's no intelligence there.

I do firmly believe that GPT-3 and ChatGPT were essentially both the beginning and the end of what's possible. If only because we're firmly running out of new suitable training data. Right now, we're all just waiting out the clock to see when the capital figures this out.

Staying with Nvidia is clever, though. They're profitable while the companies using their hardware are operating at a loss with no realistic path to profitability. They don't need AI to work, they just need people to think it will. I'd be concerned about Nvidia's pivot, though.

So far, the industry has managed to keep specialized GPUs relevant ever since that first started for hashing / blockchain mining. But if AI becomes less relevant and there's nothing to fill the gap, I'd be concerned whether Nvidia can retain its position next to AMD for more general purpose hardware.; People like to be cynical. Nothing ever happens!

Sora is bigger than video generation. LLMs gain an understanding of the semantic space through prediction, within which is encoded true and useful relationships.

eg X ""To get eggs I went to the _blank_"" Is semantically similar to Y ""You can get eggs at the store"", so an LLM that had Y in the training set can generalize to things like X.

Well Sora and other video prediction tools gain an understanding of the video space, which encodes physically useful relationships. If you go watch Sora, you'll see it understands some things, like lighting and shadows some physical processes, but then not others... Yet. Just like you can generate an agent from a powerful LLM, you will soon be able to do the same with video gen, but it will actually have a physical understanding of the world. 

We would then be ~2/3 of the way to a fully autonomous talking humanoid robot. The other third being integrating these 2 + physical control mechanism into one model.

I can't guarantee AI won't go down, but you can be sure it will go higher than it is now within the decade, barring bad black swan events.; Reasonable P/E ratio at 51!!

Hahahaha haha; I also worked for a major provider and deployed these models .. and talk to tip of the spear expert resources deploying these models at customer sites on a weekly basis at major household brands and firms. 

I'm sorry but you are repeating everything I hear from 'experts' with no actual understanding of how these tools are playing out in the enterprise space. OP who works at the cloud provider is dead on, and I know for a fact that many firms are not seeing the returns they were hoping for and panic is starting to set in. These firms pivoted so hard that major issues are popping up elsewhere in their already massive tech stacks 

Yes yes yes, people use them every day... But they have massive limitations and when you bring this up to people who are on the outside trying to look in, all you hear is ""yea but we are just scratching the surface""; Transformer architecture has been a thing since 2017. Some of the examples you give are in fact big data rebranded as AI.


This whole bubble is based on the _perception_ that AI is ""thinking"" because it mimics human speech pretty well. Behind the scenes, it's based on things discovered years ago and scaled up. And we're at the end of the scaling up part.


It's going to work 97% of the time but the last 3% is so critical that it can never be trusted to do a whole critical job, and once companies start charging enough to break even on their products the value may not be there. ; They have made one specifically for AI with different types of AI broken down to where they are on the cycle. It's worth a look even just for a balanced view, obviously can't predict the future.

By 'new' area I mean one that isn't mature / plateaud; GenAI is still garbage for any true SME material where accuracy matters. Garbage in, garbage out. The worst part is the people most tempted to use it or the ones who are typically least likely to catch the nuanced errors that are still pervasive.

It's nice for generating code, but we've actually banned it on any client related deliverable work at my consulting firm because the hallucinations are as bad as ever. Doesn't help that they've run out of public internet content to feed these models so now they are feeding them AI-generated content to learn, which is just ass backwards AF. I recall reading that chatgpt-5 is based on like 40% AI-generated synthetic content lol...and the accuracy is barely any better than 4.

I don't find tools that spit out routinely questionable content to be that useful personally. And I'm not alone, industry is still struggling to actually monetize these features and customers continue to not be impressed. Hell even isheep don't believe in it...

The predictive text argument is correct and wrong at the same time. There’s more juice to it than it may seem.

LLMs do learn to recognise and apply patterns and it’s what they do exclusively and by design, all correct. But a solution process is a pattern too. For example, when you see 11x12=? you either know the answer because you learned the pattern before or apply a step-by-step process to get to it. Both are patterns and LLMs can do both.

LLMs have been trained mostly with the first type of pattern because it’s the most available kind of data. RLHF has oppened the door to process-type patterns. but the data is much harder and expensive to curate. The introduction of agents will make it way easier to record processes and their outcomes, accelerating the improvement cycle.

That’s on the research side. On the market side there are tens of thousands of companies that will soon see a real value on moving to the cloud and have their piles of static data become actually usable. It is already STARTING to change every single industry; >But if AI becomes less relevant and there's nothing to fill the gap, I'd be concerned whether Nvidia can retain its position next to AMD for more general purpose hardware.

I'd be concerned about this too, but I fundamentally disagree. For example:

>What we're calling AI now is nothing more than autocomplete. A very powerful form of it, sure, but there's no intelligence there.

You could call it that, but human cognition also relies on recognizing patterns and applying them recursively. AI is different in that it does the same with language without understanding it, but it's pattern matching nonetheless -- not so different than humans.

>I do firmly believe that GPT-3 and ChatGPT were essentially both the beginning and the end of what's possible. If only because we're firmly running out of new suitable training data.

GPT 3.5 and 4 with significant improvements beyond 3, making new things possible. I experienced this directly as when they came out I was at a public company building their first AI products. ""ChatGPT"" is just a chatbot interface and the first application of AI that really brought it into public awareness, which is why it's immensely important. But the chatbot UI is just the beginning. It's kind of like how with the internet everything was 'internet enabled' and with mobile there was a mobile version of every website (remember the .mobi extension?), etc. But now the internet is just part of everything. The same will happen to AI.

I use AI multiple times a day and have built multiple products with it than generate strong revenues (people pay for it because they find it useful). Maybe you have different experiences. I don't expect to change your mind here, but I guess we'll see what happens.; Very well said.

That is another exciting aspect, will models like Sora help us create a model of reality?

That's also one of the key differences in how Tesla is now training its FSD (video) vs. Waymo (Lidar).

While it's fun to talk about what we're seeing today, there's no doubt there's a ton of latent discoveries and opportunities that we haven't scratched the surface of.; I think AI does what humans can do in those spaces being discussed here but without the efficiency/cost reduction of ""intuition."" That is, humans work more like quantum computers, meaning that current AI, limited by the traditional hardware paradigm, can do the same thing but requires much more cost.; >I know for a fact that many firms are not seeing the returns they were hoping for and panic is starting to set in. These firms pivoted so hard that major issues are popping up elsewhere...

I agree, and people said the same thing about the internet and electricity, e.g. when they just swapped steam engines for electric motors without redesigning factory workflows. They're called disruptive technologies for a reason.

I also saw the same thing at the public company I left a year ago trying to implement AI, so I 100% agree with you. Don't you remember last year when every public CEO was scrambling to come up with an 'AI strategy'? Of course most of them are garbage. Even outside of AI, how often do even basic refactors at large organizations end well? 😆

But there's a reason the opposite is true at newer companies standing up AI in new functions because when you start from zero you don't have to wrestle with the legacy assumptions and stacks (think building a new house vs. renovating an old one).

This is true for every new technology. In fact, has there ever been a groundbreaking new technology that just 'slid right in' to the existing paradigm without a hitch?

One way to help see around this is asking:

* Can the new technology do a meaningful number of things in a new and better way?
* Is it expected to continue to get better, cheaper and faster?
* Do we expect the advantages to outweigh the disruption, friction and growing pains of implementing it?
* Will companies who successfully implement the technology have a meaningful competitive advantage over those who don't?

Maybe you really believe the answer to those questions is no, and that's fine. But I believe the answer is yes with strong conviction.; Interesting find, thanks.

https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/hype-cycle-for-artificial-intelligence; I think he's arguing that we are starting the maturing stage, and that AI was initially worked on years ago.; Gotcha, thank you for clarifying. I agree, it's worth looking at for a balanced view, I will check it out.; I disagree with your sentiment, but I do agree there's some truth in some of your examples and I do agree that Apple Intelligence sucks.; It’s less about ‘religion’ and more about observation. Anyone paying attention can see the transformative impact AI already has across industries — from automating complex tasks to accelerating research and innovation. Calling it ‘religion’ dismisses the very real, tangible changes happening today.; I'm very new to all this - can you help me understand the two metrics in the context of this conversation? I tried asking Perplexity but it didn't help as much.; Yes i totally agree. But you can write total return with a time period. Somehow that makes it easier for laymen.; That's fair.

Getting lazy trying to respond to all comments.; Just strong short term conviction about the recovery, particularly since they are one of Nvidia's key partners, which is driving their strong revenue growth. So it really ties back to strong conviction in Nvidia.; > Both are patterns and LLMs can do both.

…no? It's a large *language* model. It doesn't know the meaning of 11 or 12. There is no way for it to understand in a general way that multiplying by 12 is one more than multiplying by 11. Sure, you can train it on lots of calculations and keep fine-tuning it until it gets most of them right. But what you're doing then is taking computers (which are really good at computing) and making them compute like a human (which are not). I… fail to see the benefit of this.

> It is already STARTING to change every single industry

I never denied this. I'm just pretty sure it's also *finishing*. The fact that a change happened is no guarantee that it will continue happening.; > AI is different in that it does the same with language without understanding it, but it's pattern matching nonetheless 

No it isn't. It's just statistically deciding the likelihood of one token following a sequence of tokens. That is all. There is absolutely nothing else going on than just that. The more tokens you can fit in your context and the more data you throw into your model, the more comprehensible the output becomes, yes. But that's still not pattern matching, it's just predictive text.

>  making new things possible

Like what? I still remember hearing the same arguments about Bitcoin. It was also going to be part of everything. That didn't exactly pan out.

> and have built multiple products with it than generate strong revenues

Did you train your own models? Do you run inference on your own hardware? If the answer to either or both of those questions is 'no', then your strong revenues depend on other companies operating at a loss to provide these things for you. How sustainable do you think that is?; Waymo is also different in the way the problem is approached IMO. They started with a ""simple version of the problem"" (Phoenix with flat grid-like layout), they geofence the autonomous area, there are operation centers (which I think will never go away) that monitor and can intervene remotely if required. It's rather unemotional and more pragmatic in the sense that they don't just seem to assume that the problem can be solved automagically in all its forms and variations, but providing the autonomous ride service is priority #1 and not general self-driving.

They can scale up the business city by city and capture the parts of the market that bring a lot of $$$ (vast urban areas with simple traffic environment), learn and fix/constraint the product, so it becomes viable and as efficient as possible without having the ambition/pressure to solve it for the entire (ever-changing) global system of roads all at once.; NP, it's closer to 300%.; Yeah, no worries. You should expect to get your balls busted after making a brag post about how much money you made on NVDA and Meta (not exactly sleeper picks there) with your reasoning being AI, trust me. Lots of us went heavy AI and made life changing money these past few years. Question is whether it will keep rolling or slow down in the mid term. Your posts so far don't inspire me that you've got much of an edge looking forward. But what do I know?; I disagree, but I appreciate your insight. We shall see.; Yep, that's a good point. Given it seems every Tesla is collecting data and Elon is building ever bigger clusters, maybe they'll break through with the AI getting good enough to allow fully autonomous driving like Waymo in some areas.

If that actually happens it seems they'd be hard to catch up with given the immense data advantage. But then again, there are other meaningful economic dynamics to make things really work. Like will people want their cars to be used as Robotaxis? If not, will Tesla really want that capital expense? Will there be Tesla 'roadlords' who own a stable of cars to get rented out? Will the layouts of cities change when car ownership drops, therefore reducing the need to even use cars on a daily basis long-term?

Exciting times.; Okay, *now* I believe you."
105,Investing in publicly-traded assets to benefit from AI automation,"What are the best strategies/channels to access investments that are hypothesized to benefit from advancements in AI and agentic workflow automation?

Are there funds focused on this? I'm specifically thinking about how some big public incumbent companies will be hurt by it (like Chegg) and others will greatly benefit from it. There must be a number of criteria that can be evaluated based on publicly available data and are hypothesized to correlate with positive financial outcomes in the age of AI automation. For example:

\-big white collar labor expenditures as a percentage of revenue and costs, indicating an outsized return on bottom line EBITDA from investing in AI automation

\-large audiences

\-large proprietary databases and content

\-large R&D budgets

\-defensible network effects. etc.

How can I easily and effectively invest to benefit from these kinds of hypotheses? For the sake of focus, fine to focus the conversation on publicly traded stocks and funds.

I know there are AI tools to analyze SEC filings, and I could build a list of hypotheses to evaluate, but this is a lot of work and others are better suited to do it than I (and I assume already have).

EDIT: I'm looking to identify companies that benefit from second order effects of AI rather than chip makers and LLM builders like META, MSFT, GOOG, AAPL, NVDA.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hfea7v/investing_in_publiclytraded_assets_to_benefit/,1,2024-12-16 08:57:33,"Generally speaking, all companies everywhere will benefit from AI.

You’ll reach 1M before 45 with your quality portfolio imo!

Well done again!; I'm 40. At 35 i had about 150k in market. Today it's worth 1.7m. My advice...

Put bulk of portfolio in things like VOO, QQQ, VTI etc. A little overlap is fine. At least 65%. Almost all if you don't know what you're doing. 

Dividend investing is overrated.

Keep a really nice emergency fund or some sort of quick liquidity for a downturn. Millions are made in the bear market. Run in when others are running away. You need the capital to do it tho.

I firmly believe bitcoin isn't going away. 1 to 5% ibit at least.

Take the other 20 to 30% and buy individual stocks but only after you paper traded and feel extremely confident. This requires more research and time. 

1m isn't nearly enough to retire.  Think 5m with inflation in 10 years. 

Cashflow is important so keep the business and just delegate to employees when the time comes?

High net worth in brokerage opens up doors to massive opportunities.  Think margin loans, covered calls, etc. You can make money on the shares you own. Just manage risk. You can loan yourself money to invest elsewhere for like 6% apr with only interest due. 

Manage those taxes well. Don't forget about ira, hsa, solo 401k etc.; Dude the good news is that youre a worker, you know how to work.

If I had your portfolio, I would sell 10k of my Tesla holdings now. That stock seems way too high and volatile. I’d put that money in a World Etf like VWRL.; One million won’t go a long way at 45. You don’t mention if you’re married or have children, which is a big unknown. You wouldn’t have to worry about insurance if the wife still works, otherwise insurance will chew up a good portion of what you’ll earn.

Unlikely your SS would be worth anything as you have not paid much in by age 45

It won’t last.; what app is that; Unrelated, but.. Which app do you use, OP?; 1 mil 10 years from now is not going to be enough, IMHO. Even in a low cost of living place, unless you are going to homestead, would you also plan to have 0 mortgage/rent? You can ""count"" on 55 - 65k/year off the million, so if you want to keep up with benchmark target inflation, half of that needs to stay in the fund. Also, you will be paying mostly short-term cap gains on those dividends. Also, being is dividend yielding stocks means you are less exposed to as much upside gains. Now, saying that you just want to take 24k/year in dividends and let any real growth in the portfolio roll means that it's up to your part time work to make up the rest and somehow either purchase or find an employeer that will offer you a health insurance plan.

If you own your own business, you should set up a solo 401k through Fidelity. Call them and they can walk you through it.

Thanks!; If you are planning to hold gains for another 20-25 years that would mean holding until after age 65+ which means you should definitely be making the max deposit of $7,000 into a Roth IRA each year to get capital gains free profits.

My other and more important  advice is to please invest in Bitcoin. It does have to be all your investments, but seriously consider it. $FBTC is a very easy way to buy into bitcoin in a Roth IRA and get 100% correlations to bitcoin’s price. Bitcoin is up 1300% over the last 5 years and has outperformed the S&P500 over any 5 year span you start at.

You will be far better off in the long run to buy now than wait.; Google is facing a gauntlet of anti trust lawsuits, depending on the outcome this could potentially result an a significant decrease in share value since investor confidence in the company is largely based on its perceived near monopoly in its spaces.

Maybe consider rebalancing away from that company.

NVIDIA currently has a near monopoly on semiconductor architecture that power the growing use of AI models. And while many think AI is the buzz word of the year like blockchain was a few years ago. And is probably in a bubble.

I’d start cashing out and buying up ETFs; So first off congratulations! But this has to be one of the highest volatility portfolios I’ve ever seen! You e done well but this is a ticking time bomb. You are almost 100% in Large cap tech sector only. Stop buying individual stocks and buy index funds. You already have a lot of the top S&P 500 stocks… so I wouldn’t do VOO, VTI would be better for you because it has a little mid and small cap as its a total market fund. Then get a little international exposure of like 5% with VXUS. You also need some bond allocation 10% to 20% I run 15% myself with 10% in BND and 5% in BNDX which is international bonds. 5% in a REIT like VNQ would also further diverse you into real estate. I’d also add some dividend funds… I like SCHD, VIG, and VYM I own all 3. With how heavy you are in tech I’d also say add some sector ETFs like VDE, VHT, VPU to get some exposure in healthcare, pharma, utilities, gas and oil. You could also add some consumer discretionary and consumer staples. Diversify and do it quickly. If a tech bubble hits you’re going to lose half your money overnight.

1.  If you qualify for a Roth IRA do that ASAP and max it out. This will also provide you a rainy day fund; meaning, all the money you put in there (7,500 per year) is after tax money. You can almost treat it like a saving account to an extent. At any point you can take out whatever money you put in anytime. You’re only penalized taking money out on interest earned. Also, if you have kids any money in your Roth can be used for college education without penalty. 

2. While it’s nice paying your home off leverage equity in your house when rates drop, assuming you have an interest rate when they were at all time lows during COVID. 2 a 3.5%. I personally took out equity in my home at a rate of 3.2% and invested in mutual funds that have provided returns the last 4 years above 26% (FXAIX and FDGRX).  I leveraged money to make money.

3. While smaller - make sure you’re in a money market account related to your checking account.  I am in a high yield account providing a 4.6% return on my money. 

4. Think about CDs right now. Rates are still above 5% percent which is guaranteed return. 

I listed a few basic options for growing your portfolio. There are many alternatives but figured I’d help you with a few basic items.

(I’m the same age as you); Think about starting to get some passive income by way of dividend yield and diversifying into some reit and energy opportunities with your future contributions. A good mix of growth and divs is great.; All in mstr and you will retire at 45; Sorry to be blunt but you're delusional if you think either of your target are achievable.

There doesn't appear to be enough context to make that judgement.

A common scenario I could come up with, they saved what they could each year, 18 to 25 like $2-4k/yr as a student going for their masters, 25-28 still the same because they paid student debt, and after that they're now saving $35k/yr.

It all depends on the distribution of their saving capacity, where they are in reference to the ceiling of their profession and then how close they are to the floor of their spending.

I've seen nurses in Canada be DINKs in their 30s, only live on their partners salary and plow $35-60k/yr into savings. Plus the RRSP refund for deferral income. Then factor in compound interest during that time and they're close to what OP said. Canadians for example also have TFSA which are accounts with base table contribution room of ~$100k and anything yielded within the account is non-taxed.

With inflation, not sure you have a comparable retirement at 65.

I would just work until you get the one million and then decide what to do. For me at least, it did not change much as our pension contribution did drop, but not to such a degree as to really feel the difference. ; A lot of good stable American companies pay 7%ish or even more. High quality dividend ETFs pay 5%. So you could definitely get more than 2k a month on a million. Just sayin.; I’m in a similar mindset. I’m 36 and have just over $200k.

2. 45k a year gives you 25 years not considering growth of investment. But 45k a year will eat into your principal fast (it will be higher than this due to inflation). 

3. Spy does not give consistent 10% every year. There are years it makes money and looses money. The years it looses money you have to sell more equities to cover expenses. 1m could fall to 800k in a year with spy. If I have to sell spy at a loss one year I’ve sold a lot more equites. 

$2.5-$3m is when you can really get by fine. House paid off. Money running in the market you don’t have to take out to build more wealth. And expenses covered. $1m at 45 is not enough for those and many other reasons; not at 45; The dividend strategy is long dead as a winner. It only still survives because people like it in theory. You'll end up with more money by keeping the money in VOO and selling when you need some.; Hahahahah; Don’t sell, buy more typically is better advice for index investing. Doubling down on an individual name after it loses 50%+ is not always great. Holding 25% of your net worth in NVDA is also a recipe for volatility; Vanguard S&P 500 ETF -> VOO; I buy Schwab ETFs. Just buy 50% SCHB (Broad market) and 50% SCHD (Dividend). You will see quarterly dividend income reinvested from both these ETFs and your portfolio will keep growing. When the markets are down, then these will be down too but not as much as the Mag 7 or any individual stock.; SCHD; SPY, QQQ, TLT (long term bonds), BIL (short term bonds); SCHD if you want dividends; If you like tech (which you seem to) consider QQQ.; its what I want to do as well.  bonds are a joke.  and if you are just a little short, a small position in a covered call ETF isn't bad.  especially if you choose one that doesn't hurt your principal over time.  don't let anyone beat you up, dividends are not bad.  they are important to all total returns.  People get caught up in hugh Growth sticks.  diversification is ok.  also check out Reits.  check out VICI and ADC.  I keep a small position in both so I can follow it and see how things go.; VOO is good for now durring accumulation.  He's talking SCHD for later, my guy; yes, there are 3 screen shots they uploaded.  you only seen the first one I think.  you got to swipe; Okay, partial retirement is completely different because you still have some money coming in.  

You didn’t answer the most important part of the question.  How much will you be contributing each year?  Even with a 10% average return, you are looking at 20 years before your $170,000 turns into a million.

With a more conservative interest rate of 7% you will need to contribute around $4,000 per month to reach 1 million in 10 years (ignoring inflation).; I think you’re really underestimating inflationary pressures. Get yourself out of the trenches and into a management position if at all possible; MA 200p dec20 got it. Yoloooo!; Lol most noob opinion I've seen recently. You know nothing yet. Hfsp.; Agree and I love RSI tracking as well; honestly 😂 earlier this month when it shot up was a W its timing it similar to stocks and the analysis from sources aswell as the charts, managed to sell when it dipped got a 150% return and gonna put some more back in soon just trying to pin point when, but even that shows, if you can spot patterns the returns are so much better, See bitcoin as Gold its the safe slow way(the store house) but also you need the other incomes (the shit coins that shits coins if done correctly) to increase how much you put into the store house if that analogy makes sense; That’s hard earned money to put all into something as volatile as crypto. Not saying you shouldn’t invest, but maybe allocate a reasonable percentage so you don’t end up with nothing. A lot of people make a fortune off of crypto trading but many others lose it as well.; Be careful of a tech market downturn, it would likely obliterate your portfolio, maybe move to broader index fund with more stocks in it from multiple markets. It’ll be slower gains but much more stable in long run; I had never heard of HCA today but it looks like it’s at the bottom of an ascending channel from a technical standpoint. A lot of people like SPY and QQQ because they contain a lot or all of these stocks listed above and many more. These ETFs will tend to outperform in both bull and bear markets. And the reason I would sell XRP is because it just rallied off the charts and with crypto being very technical responsive it seems like it has a lot of correcting to do. Amazon definitely hold for life and Tesla seems overvalued to me but speculation is high with trump in office. I like all the other picks though good value stocks; This should have been on the original post. Only other recommendation would be keep savings rate high, save 25% of income at a minimum.

 I’d also recommend take advantage of all the different tax advantage accounts you can have. Sounds like you could be 1099 or small business? Get an ira going and look into what options you might have for your income bracket.; What is mag7?; No one is even close to have a robot which can fold my laundry.; XRP actually looks very good I would hold it.

In general though yeah it is easier/safer to just buy Bitcoin and forget it.; Dont listen to some user named DICKPIXTHROWAWAY unless you want to lose all your money; Less risk, income producing.; Perfect! Are you working to transition from employee to owner? A million in the bank is wage slave think. Gross a million a year instead.

Disclaimer: Am dumbass who does not gross a million a year.... yet. Give me eight to ten more years at about 15% growth haha.; Do you own your own busines, or work for someone else?; Because you don't know what it is, how it works or why to hold it.; That why you buy some sector ETFs, some international exposure and you need bonds yesterday.; Ya I could easily at 4%/year. Even 3%; Not if the account is a Roth- you won’t get taxed; with the name aggressive gambler, it's probably not a great idea; Perhaps build your strategy using a market sim. First - 🤷‍♂️; Delegate and expand.; Personally I don't mind full time work, especially in my current job which I love. I'm just investing to get the cash together to buy a house outright so that I never have to pay for rent/mortgage ever again. From there, the next goal is have enough money from investments that my partner can pursue her goal as an artist full time too.

I think anyone looking at FIRE is how to make shelter as cheap as possible, or free if you can help it. Shelter seems to be the biggest investment youll ever make; It wont stay the same the stock market doesn’t just pause tf you talking about. He can take the dividends while the stocks continue to gain in value; he's assuming the market will keep rallying for the next 10 yrs. This is not very likely whatsoever.

like others here, i would just recommend saving what you can. try to live independently (be a handyman, farm a bit, be frugal).

don't aim for any set figure. instead aim to be frugal and have faith in your government. your government rewards frugality and hard work. whether benchmark outcome you arrive on, trust i your government to look after you. (ie: be careful who you vote for. dont vote for trump-types).; $500K in 7% tax free municipal bonds pays $35K/yr.  This leaves a large chunk of your $$$ available to grow. Even at a 10% S&P yield it'll double every 7.; With the potential to lose a lot of your principal. There's a reason people derisk as they grow older.; What good stocks pay 7%?; Exactly; For me at least, I realized that you can stop your contributions and use that money on other things, but you cannot actually take the cash out, not just yet if you have about 15 more years before you trigger a pension. 

So, I am 50, and I have reached my target and I plan to stop contribution to the pension fund, and  spend that cash elsewhere. From 55 to 60-ish, we might start to tap the pension fund a nice lifestyle, but really not stop working. from 60-ish, the idea is withdraw more and do part time until 67, then keep on going until we cannot go any more. 

The it be at home most of the time, and the pension will be used for better healthcare (helper, nurse, etc) until we die.  

Stopping work is not really an option yet, both for mental and frankly, 1M is not enough any more; 60% is an awesome figure well done!  I’m 34% to pension and 20% ISA.; In what century is the returns better with real estate then equities?  The only benefit to real estate is you can buy it on debt and have a tenant pay the note.  If you’re working with your own money (like OP is talking about) or don’t want to deal with renters then equities have outperformed by a wide margin.; wtf…; VOO's average returns are roughly 18% a year when split up on the 5 year chart -- this is 160k a year to do nothing. After taxes it's still like having a 160k a year job -- unless you're raising kids in your retirement this is more than enough. 

You don't need to sit and wait on it, you just have to work for one year while it compounds the first year and then you start paying yourself.

If this isn't enough to retire you might have different standards for retirement than the average person.; What am I missing?; Agreed. Buying individual stocks in general is not recommended.; why VOO and not SPY; I don’t see the appeal of SCHD tbh. Not good in taxable accounts due to higher tax rate on dividends and it underperforms VOO over time.; Thanks for those. I’ll save those to my watch list; Thoughts on QQQ?; Added to Roth; Added; Why would SCHD be better later?; Oh... I feel dumb now. I guess I didn't notice it. Thanks!; These % returns aren't relevant to him. He is picking individual stocks and might make it to that 1 million from it or very likely lose a lot of his current principle instead.; Right now I am investing around 1,000 a month sometimes 1,500 if I can but mostly saving as cash on the sideline for dip buying. 

I need to start setting it up more per month, but I’ve preferred saving ammo for dips and invest heavier on specific drops then spreading it out each month; 😂 yeah I guess; Yes, HCA is always been solid for me. It’s had a tough month or two just now but I do believe it’ll bounce back. I was just doing some portfolio management. I had too much percentage.; Correct.  I have a separate ROTH going with around 30,000 of this total in it.  My tax lady got me into that IRA about 5 years ago; MAG-7 is a pump-action shotgun manufactured by Techno Arms PTY of South Africa since 1995. Ask your wife’s boyfriend if he’ll take you to the range sometime.; https://www.investopedia.com/magnificent-seven-stocks-8402262

The Magnificent Seven stocks are a group of high-performing and influential companies in the U.S. stock market: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla.; Do you have a preference between Bitcoin and Bitcoin ETF?; No I started my landscaping business about 8 years ago. Everything is now paid off so I can start stacking back for my portfolio; Own my own business; Well then you won’t get better returns anyway; Doesn’t work. Sim trading never works becuase it not your money you are risky and mindset changes everything in trading. 

Now if you are already successful and have a build a solid capital trading. Sim trading can be a good way to test out new strategy

Sim trading for a beginner with zero experience will just give them a dangerous false sense of confidence; Then why would you wait until you have a $1M to buy a house outright?! If you have 20% down payment then do it right away bc like you said you still have to pay rent in the meantime so why not pay your own mortgage instead of someone else’s mortgage?! A property has 2 things working for you: 1 house values tend to go up over time by 5-10% a year on average and secondly your principle payments towards the mortgage brings that balance down. If your horizon is 10 to 20 years then the mortgage should be close to paid off in 25 years. If you have a basement or rent out a portion of the house then the rent will help pay down that mortgage faster. Later if you want to be more aggressive refinance the equity in the first home and use that as a down payment to buy a rental property and rent it out. As long as it’s cash flow positive you are making money and having someone else pay your mortgage for you! In the meantime keep investing in the market but definitely diversify your portfolio with real estate!; 24K from a 500K pot is 4.8%, and to get just that kind of dividend, (for example SPDR S&P Global Dividend Aristocrats UCITS ETF) you will be looking at stable blue chip stock where the stock price only grows at the rate of inflation.

Of course OP can try VOO, which pays out 1.18% in dividend, and he will have to sell some of his holding in VOO to make up the difference.

So, if OP wants to take out 4.8% and let say inflation is about 2.5% average, and  historically the S&P grows about 8 % per year, you can see that his pension pot does not grow that much after that.

Will the pension pot grow? Yes. Enough to retire on when he is 65? I dont really think so.

try this out, and you can see  

[https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/financial-goals#analysisResults](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/financial-goals#analysisResults); Fucking stock market subreddit telling people to farm smh; Energy transfer. 
You can get a ETF for diversity that’s 5%; Yeah, you answered your own question.  80/20 leverage on a fixed loan that can’t be called is what makes the returns much better. 

Dealing with renters and a property is a little work for sure, but not much; VOO 10 year average has been around 8-10%. Already a bad take. You’re in this for the long term, five year returns are not what you should be looking at.

You also have to take into account capital gains tax. You are not getting everything you take out. 

Down years in the market mean you will liquidate more equities. Liquidating between 2022 and 2023 would have set you back alot.

If you plan on living the activity level lifestyle of an 80 year old retiree as a healthy 45 year old, then maybe you can get by confining yourself to one million and never work again. But this is highly unrealistic. 

How about you retire at 45 on one million and document your life so we can watch you sit around and do nothing or watch you run out of money then have to go back to work at 60; Spy expense ratio is much higher; VOO better; Do you even understand what a dividend growth ETF (SCHD) is and what a S&P 500 tracking ETF (VOO) is? They are two totally different categories of ETFs. You are comparing apples to oranges.

SCHD pays you quarterly dividends with about 3.4% yield, so it will pay you $0.26/share at the end of each quarter. It only holds stocks of companies that pay consistent dividends. It's an income generating ETF, so the share price will never go up as much as something that tracks the S&P 500 which is made up of 34% tech companies and hence is doing good at the moment. SCHD dividends are also qualified dividends, so you pay less taxes compared to capital gains.

If you want growth and have high risk tolerance, then you should buy VOO, as when tech slumps VOO will slump bad, however, if you want consistent stable income that will keep increasing (irrespective of the share price) then invest in SCHD, as SCHD on average increased their dividend payout 8-10% per year.; I’ve done really well in SWPPX. I also have VOOG and SWPPX has outperformed it. To be fair I bought SWPPX during the bigger 2020 pandemic dip. I hadn’t chosen anything to stick my yearly retirement contribution into, so I picked SWPPX. I often wonder if I had chosen to split the money 50/50 which would be doing better? But I’m not wondering hard enough to run a simulation on it. 😂; most of my money is in SCHG. BKLC is another good one, QQQ of course. otherwise SCHB and SCHD along with SPY are all in rotation for me.; for stability.  the S&P 500 is very uneven and 30% is overweight to the magnificent 7 alone.  I think tech is gonna dominate for another 10 years, but it's not good risk for someone ready to retire.; Using $1,250 monthly you’d need to average 14% for 10 years, and using $1,000 you’d need to average 15%.  It’s not impossible, but pretty unlikely you will be able to achieve those return without taking some risks, which obviously comes with some downside.; That’s the sweet spot. Roth will make you a tax free millionaire if you pile money into it right.; Unless you plan to buy a ledger and hold the Bitcoin yourself probably best to just stick with IBIT or one of the other Bitcoin ETFs.

You pay a very small fee (I think 0.25%) for the ETF but it's worth it for most people to know they won't lose their Bitcoin to a hack.

There are also Ethereum ETFs now too. Long term Bitcoin will always be safer but maybe mix in 25% ETH ETF too for extra upside potential.; Fair enough, I know I'm not giving investment advice but you said open to anything so I thought I'd share. Do the math on adding a crew. Invest in a really aggressive marketing campaign and see if you can pull enough new properties to justify a crew. Invest in yourself was some of the best advice I was ever given. Just passing it along.

I'm an ETF guy anyway :); Sim. Trading helps you test your strategy with zero loss of capital … trading with out a strategy means you will be susceptible to emotions ..; It depends on where you live.  Where I live (Southern California) a mortgage is WAY more than rent.  I pay $3400 to rent a 4br/2ba.  Any decent (not sketchy neighborhood) condo in this area is $800k+ and then HOA on top ($250-350+).  With 20% down, the mortgage, HOA, prop taxes, and insurance you’re looking at $5k or more a month.  Even the mobile homes are going for $500k+ down here.  For a house—forget about it.  I’ve basically assumed I’ll never own a house down here unless someone dies and leaves us their house lol.; Because rent is still cheaper than a mortgage in 99% of cases. Also, it's easier to turn 100k into 200k than 1k into 100k. Why hit 100k and then have to start again?; Well you have taxes, insurance, and maintenance.  Those add up to be a lot.  Apartment landlords can distribute those costs across many tenants instead of one person being solely responsible for their house.  They can also skimp on maintenance altogether.

Having a single family home is a great lifestyle.  But as an investment one is lucky if they break even.  The only time you really come out ahead on a home is buying early in a hot market.; Why? 

If an 800k mortgage is $7k a month, why not invest money at 10% per year and rent a house for $3500?; This advice may not work in 2024 with a 6.5-7.5% mortgage rate; Why would you calculate that off 500k? I assume you handpicked that amount to fit your argument. This thread and OP in his comment above clearly assumes 1 million by the time he is 45. You pulled 500k out of your ass; Secret to retiring early is just to farm a bit.; I just took out a bunch of credit cards balance transfers check and then used the margin account to really load up.  That’s good leverage too.; You’re exposing yourself to lower growth over time, but you “understand” what you’re investing in, so all good.; Thoughts on SPYI?; I don't see it; A paid off house and 4,000 a month check in the mailbox/account sounds great to me at the age of 55-60 god willing; Agree. If I could push saving 2,000 a month that would help a lot in the long run; to be fair, investing in the S&P500 over the past 5 years would have been pretty close to matching that. A few fairly safe bets on companies with strong fundamentals would massively boost that.; That’s my goal is to try and max out my ROTH each year. I treat that as my personal 401k; Which etf’s are apart of your portfolio? I always stayed away from etf’s I guess because of the fees associated with them. Why I went with Warren buffet / BRKB since he has a basket of solid old man picks; You sure about that with 6.5-7.5% rates in 2025?; I agree it’s not easy but with some sacrifices when you’re young and if you can manage renting out a portion of your home such as a basement to help with the cost it will pay dividends in the long run. Landlords will make sure they are cash flow positive before buying a rental and include mortgage payments, taxes, maintenance and insurance in the rent and then some. Housing market is also hard to time because if prices are dropping then mortgage rates tend to be going up so the best time is to buy when you’re young and hold and build from the growing equity.; I got lucky and bought in the south before the great migration.  Up 100% from 2015; Which means it’s 24k annually from 1mil (which will continue to grow) so it’s actually 2.4%. Thanks for your contribution; You made another mistake in your calculation. You yourself assumed s&p growth of 8% a year so in 25 years 173 will actually become nearly 1.2mil …; No I did not. See the calculation. Where  are yours? 

[https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/financial-goals?s=y&sl=5ftqPp4swbiN86abXi05PQ](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/financial-goals?s=y&sl=5ftqPp4swbiN86abXi05PQ); lol; If you want growth, why stop at VOO. You are lowering YOUR growth by not investing in crypto. 

And VOO is not a growth stock anyways, the equivalent that you are looking for is VUG (Vanguard Growth) which will grow even faster than VOO. VUG is up 37% YTD and VOO is up 26% YTD.; It's actually really good for income. Pays around 11.5% dividend which is really good, and the dividends are also qualified so are taxed as normal capital gains and not as normal income. However, the share price does not appreciate much. Question is how long they can sustain this high dividend yield, since the estimated payout coming up on 12/22 is $0.4849/share compared to $0.5206 that it paid in November. So, it is already trending down.; Where are you getting $4,000 a month from?; Sure, as long as there are no years with huge pull backs.  Remember you need a 25% increase just to offset a 20% loss (like we had in 2022), so all it would take is one or two bad years to make a 14-15% average over 10 years unachievable.  The shorter the time frame, the more you are ""gambling"", hoping for good results with no bad results mixed in.; I'm Canadian, and my picks are specific to Canadian markets, but I split between 3. One tracks the S&P500, one tracks the NASDAQ, and one is globally diversified with a 20% Canadian bias. You can find American versions of all of these recommended all over Reddit.; Global X and Vanguard has solid ETF’s; Please share your calculation, as OP said, in 10 years he wants to take 2K per month. Using the Monte Carlo simulation, the 8% growth = 500K, and after 30% it is 750000

Using a contribution of 1K per month for the next 10 year, the taking out 2 k per month after (including inflation adjustment) 

[https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/financial-goals?s=y&sl=5ftqPp4swbiN86abXi05PQ](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/financial-goals?s=y&sl=5ftqPp4swbiN86abXi05PQ); The title says 20-25 years, but if he wants the mil in 10 years and retire early then he needs somewhere between 19-20% in annual gains, which is very doable; Hey there, relax.  I make one comment and you launch into some vitriol lol. Again, if you already understand all that, all good.; If I could flip my portfolio into a dividend paying portfolio in 15-20 years and live off the dividends each month would be my ultimate goal.; No the title says 

>My goal is to reach $1 million or retire by 45

the important bit is OR. So either the stock market needs to perform at 15% every single year for the next 10 years, which I do not find that do-able at all OR he hits 45 with a more conservative return of 8 to 10 percent, which means that the pot is between 500 to 700K. 

So where are you pulling the 20% S&P 500 returns from?; $4,000 a month might be a bit ambitious depending on your local/federal taxes.  You’d need about 5% dividends with no taxes.  You’ll also need to factor in inflation over your 40 - 60 year retirement.

Good luck brother, I hope you manage to do it.  As a fellow construction worker, it’s hard on your body, and an early retirement would be great; Thanks brother 👍🏻 4,000 is shooting for the moon.  I’ll take 2,000 and be very happy if it was a dividend"

For example, don't hold a 0dte for more than 2 hours, don't hold a weekly more than a day, and don't hold a monthly more than a week. Also, sell whenever the price of the stock reaches your initial breakeven price (strike price plus premium paid) and start a new position if you think it's going to keep going up.

That’s unsustainable in the long run. 4 of the 5 largest numbers on her trades were losses. It’s almost always better to have a lower win rate with small losses than it is to have a higher win rate but large losses. This feels like beginners luck. She’s not going to be able to maintain that kind of win rate on a consistent basis.

As for PLTR calls.  The 80C has good chance of hitting.  The 87C I'm guessing was just because that's how much purchasing power she had left to use.

110,LEAPS Golden cross/Death Cross strategy question,"I have an idea for a strategy that requires quite a bit of time to do. I’m not sure if this is already a strategy so my bad if it is.

it’s self explanatory but waiting for a golden cross (or death cross) and buying a LEAPS.

I was basically wondering what are some issues with this strategy if anyone’s tried something similar, apart from the obvious like the lagging affect because it’s an AVERAGE indicator…that’s obvious and is a very glaring issue but has anyone tried this strategy and found ways to get around the lag? or is this strategy just not viable if not paired with other indicators/TA

the reason i thought about this was growth stocks like meta, apple, google and most recently costco had golden crosses and have gone up so high. costcos last golden cross was at like $887 or so and it’s now trading at \~$980 to $1000.

Obviously the longer you let a LEAPS run solely based off an AVERAGE indicator, the more risk your taking on cause it could very well cause a late exit and loss in profit. but what about doing maybe a month of price movement, and exiting?

would a golden cross LEAPS strategy not be viable? why or why not? i’d love to hear everyone’s thoughts!",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1heib5t/leaps_golden_crossdeath_cross_strategy_question/,0,2024-12-15 02:56:17,"

[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse); my thoughts are:

1.) you used soooo many words it implies you not only expect us to read, you believe we can

2.) if this regarded idea is a way you can use to help you specifically overcome the buy high sell low strategy many in wsb implement then the chances of you contributing loss porn are much lower and that may be a personal win, but it’s a loss to this community; https://preview.redd.it/958ho7uwmx6e1.jpeg?width=200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9c2ac9fabbb50bcc07aff30c384adaddac392296; As no one explained it to me I had to look it up.


So a golden cross is literally just a recent increase in shareprice.


So what you try to say is: stock just went up so it will go up more thus I buy call.


Which is literally the most basic thing one could do in a stock market requiring 0 understanding of markets or business.


But you phrased in such a way to make it seem new.; It's easy to fool yourself into thinking golden crosses work because you're always looking at it in hindsight in stocks that have done well. I've fallen for this many times and I realised that's what I'm doing wrong. I look at successful stocks and thinking like oh there was a golden cross, that must work. But of course they had a golden cross, these are some of the best performing stocks.

I'd use it more as a clue to dig deeper into its price history and fundamentals and any other TA you understand. Use TA to convince yourself that it has growth left in it, but back it up with fundamentals to justify the movement.; Wtf is a golden cross?; I’ve thought of this before, it’s good to backtest extensively and see how many times it’s worked and how many times it hasn’t. I would probably go out a year on most of them, that way i can capture more of the move and give it time. Also only look for crosses on the daily timeframe or weekly even that’ll probably give you the best chance of having a successful trade; Indicators are often not as shallow as they seem. The golden cross is not just a recent change in price, it's a sustained medium term change in price, enough so to cross the long term price average. 200/50/20 day sma/ema changes with each day change, so the 50 day moving moving average is contained within the 200 day moving average as well. I.e. When the price changes both the 200 and 50 day average changes with it. 

But given that 50 day average is fairly medium term, this suggests it's not just accelerated growth, but sustained growth. If the 50 day averages approaches 200 day average and stays there it suggests the price is returning after a surge or slump to its previous ""stable"" price point. But if it crosses, it means there is underlying sentiment/fundamentals to suggest its value is higher/lower now than it was for a long time

Of course other factors matter. How much change it has had before and after crossing the 200 day has to be considered. Sometimes if most of the change  is already priced in it can just overshoot a bit and return, and conversely if it was already close to the 200 day and moves to cross, then it could just be a short term fluctuation 

In a way you are right but it's an important moment in a stocks history but must also be considered with other indicators and history to draw conclusions; well uh no. 

it’s an average over time. in this case the golden cross is something longer term investors pair with other indicators to signal bullish momentum. this is cause the average over the last 50 days has started increasing. this shows its bullish over an average time. 

if it crosses above the 200 that’s even better cause now it means that the 50 days prior has now beaten the last 200 days of price movement. showing that price is infact, going up. 

so yes. price go up so i must buy call cause price go up more. 

but the golden cross is a signal that price has started going up after 50 days of downward price action. and the current price is now beating the price 50 days ago and so on. 

something to keep in mind aswell u mentioned that golden crosses can be interpreted as bearish. and yes thats kind of true?

it depends cause if you let price come down and retest it, and it bounces back up, congrats cause u found a golden cross that’s providing support now. 

however if it breaks the cross, thennnnnn yea don’t touch it until it can support price. 

so yes it COULD be bearish…as could any AVERAGE indicator. the main thing is waiting for it to come down, retest, and prove its supporting. if it can’t…then no. don’t buy in. 

that’s the whole concept of indicators based on averages.; One of the schools of Hokuto Shinken; While you are right that it's not a 1 day moving average but a 50 day moving average and thus maybe midterm it still does not impact what I said.


A golden cross could also be interpreted as a bearish sign as something just having spikes recently means it might just go down to its 200 day moving average again.; 'providing support' 😂


I can't even with all that.


Ok have fun with your astrology I'll continue to focus on investing in good business models and using makroeconomics.; Wtf is a Hokuto Shinken?; You're using the term ""recently"" quite loosely. MA for one doesn't register the shortest term spikes. If the 50 day MA crosses the 200 day, the 20 day has already crossed much earlier. Which is why 20 crossing 200 doesn't mean as much as 50 crossing 200. That refers to speed or response speed of these indicators. A consistent price increase for 50 days shows its not responding to some hype, or news or crap like that, it indicates there's a substantial change in its intrinsic value

It's a bullish signal, but possibly a reason to be bearish. Indicators are meant to give you clues not conclusions. 50 crossing 200, with consistent volume, if price targets are above 200 day, if the stock is not overpurchased, and other oscillators give you confidence that growth rate isn't slowing down can all give you confidence that there is some growth still left in it.

Anyone can tell when a stock is going up, the golden cross tells you more than that; dude what 😂

it’s not astrology it’s literally an average indicator. 

how the fuck is something taking an AVERAGE a complete guess. 

fun fact ur macroeconomics (which u misspelled btw) mostly use AVERAGES cause taking single pieces of data doesn’t mean shit. Every balance sheet u look at has averages tied to it and percentages. every company you probably buy into, you most likely look into AVERAGE ROI. or you may look at a P/E ratio which is an AVERAGE. 

the MA 50 and MA200 is an AVERAGE. 

idk how this is going over ur head as much as it is lmao; Sounds like japanese ham; What are you talking about?


Yes they are averages. I never said they are not. They are recent trends compared to slightly less recent trends.


Them crossing means nothing other than it having increased more recently than before.; ""Them crossing means nothing other than it having increased more recently than before.""

yea................that's the point

they have increased more recently than before......meaning they are.......stay with me now.......becoming more bullish compared to previously. Isnt that exactly what a trend reversal is????

the crossing itself doesn't PROVE its becoming more bullish as it could also cross again and continue the trend. Its a signal that it COULD be.

the entire strategy banks and hedge funds use for MA is using it as support and resistance because if price CANT break above the MA then that means price ISNT doing better than the previous average.

once again the crossing doesn't prove anything. its a signal that ""oh shit it might be reversing"" and you wait for it to come touch down and if it holds then nice you found a good support line...this is the entire concept of every strategy reliant on price movement.

cool. it broke resistance. but will the resistance hold.

the golden cross and death cross is no different than support and resistance levels or supply and demand zones. you use them as a signal, then let them prove its stable, then enter a position."
111,Everyone's confused why NVDA didn't pump after AVGO earnings. Could the market realize that AVGO is actually a serious threat to NVDA?,"This post is meant to raise discussion. I'm hoping individuals knowledgeable on the semiconductor landscape can weigh in (specifically on NVDA's GPUs vs AVGO's XPUs/ASICs for AI workloads).

From CNBC, [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/12/broadcom-avgo-earnings-report-q4-2024-.html:](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/12/broadcom-avgo-earnings-report-q4-2024-.html:)

https://preview.redd.it/giaf186pav6e1.png?width=765&format=png&auto=webp&s=eab86a7885cfb8dca492184466962c3e46fa4b57

NVDA is currently able to charge astronomical prices for its GPUs due to lack of viable alternative chips (Blackwell margins are estimated to be \~70%). Based on my readings, companies have started seeking alternatives to NVDA's GPUs to avoid dumping hundreds of billions in capex into NVDA's pockets every year.

NVDA's customer base only consists of a handful of large tech companies, which means there is very likely overlap between AVGO's 3 'very large customers' and NVDA's (Apple is confirmed as one of those very large customers). Relative to NVDA GPUs, AVGO's ASICs are cheaper and more energy efficient but more difficult to deploy, so companies are turning to ASICs as a longer term solution for their AI data centers while continuing to rely on NVDA in the near term.

That being said, could this mean that AVGO poses a material threat to NVDA in the mid to long term? It seems like a natural conclusion if customers are actually turning to Broadcom for a long term solution to NVDA's exorbitant prices. Even after NVDA's slight dip, it's still a top 3 market cap company valued at $3.3T on \~$60B annual income, so it's still priced for perfection in terms of earnings growth. Which means if AVGO were to threaten NVDA's market share (and consequently its margins as NVDA will not be able to charge w/e it wants with viable competition) in \~3 years, that earnings growth needed to justify NVDA's massive valuation won't materialize. 

The counter point I've read is that NVDA and AVGO are not direct competitors. That NVDA GPUs will still be in high demand as they are flexible and can perform a variety of AI tasks, unlike ASICs. So NVDA's addressable market is not threatened. I've been unable to verify the validity of this claim and am hoping experts can weigh in.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hec4pn/everyones_confused_why_nvda_didnt_pump_after_avgo/,141,2024-12-14 21:48:39,"# **TLDR**

---

**Ticker:** NVDA, AVGO

**Direction:**  Uncertain, but potentially bearish for NVDA long-term.

**Prognosis:**  AVGO's XPUs might be a serious threat to NVDA's GPU dominance in the AI market, potentially impacting NVDA's future earnings growth and high valuation.  The market may be underestimating this risk.

**Bonus:**  AVGO's projected market opportunity for AI chips by 2027 is HUGE ($60B-$90B)!  That's a lot of potential market share for NVDA to lose.

**Meme Potential:** NVDA's 70% margins are looking less ""astronomical"" and more ""about to be significantly threatened"".; It is not pumping because I finally bought 100 NVDA shares few weeks ago. I even have another CSP open now. You NVDA buls are fuk.; Watch Jensen announce high-performance AI chips during CES Keynote next month.; Just buy both; Nvidia's Mellanox acquisition is the most goated move NVIDIA ever made. Nobody will be able to scale AI fabrics like Nvidia can without NVLinks superiority and interconnect.

GPU + NVLINK + CUDA + Libraries = vertically stacked business

Add in the Grace CPU on top where they can. 

Broadcom can supply chips it doesn't matter. Nvidia supplies the entire solution.; Because in the market nothing makes sense, that’s why you will lose money using logic; I bought Nvidia calls and it hasn’t gone up again since. My bad.; AVGO and NVDA really won’t be seen as competitors but more complimentary.  NVDA’s very long term play is the platform (CUDA) with the hardware as a means. So more GPUs out there isn’t a bad thing since the industry will need to consolidate a bit to avoid the specialization problems of COBOL and FORTRAN that exist in the mainframe market space still.

On the flip side though coming out of AWS re:invent, everyone has basically made their company an “AI company” but when VPs were queried in a round table, while everyone said they were working on AI solutions, very few said they were in production.  What we’re coming to find out is everyone is baking a lot currently, but the release cadence isn’t there.  There’s been a rush to get out solutions, but the efficacy isn’t being measured appropriately so garbage gets released more often than not that needs to get pulled back. 

Developing on cloud is expensive so solutions from AVGO are going to be great for long term on prem development - to control costs - while NVDA will still be the consumer cloud scale beast for those actual production workloads.

We’re in the early stages where we are past the introduction but where companies need to take a moment to get things under control before shooting for the real apex and gaining speed.  Once the cost story, quality control, and governance are really streamlined, this thing will take off even faster and further.; No one was confused, they aren't really competitors, AVGO doing good or bad isn't going to cause NVDA to rise or fall. The opposite can be true, NVDA is so big that when it's pumping, it tends to bring up the other chip stocks. Much like when BTC does well, it brings up the rest of crypto. NVDA is the long play, buy it and hold it for a few years.; Nvidia has CUDA; TSMC doing alright tho….; ITS A 3.5 TRILLION DOLLAR COMPANY ; 1 word:  CUDA; You’re completely right.

I see Nvidia in a correction phase right now, but I’m confident it will bounce back next week. As for Broadcom, I think it’s set to pump even further, especially after the positive expectations from the earnings call.

The funny part? People think the market is overheated and start shorting both stocks (and even Tesla) assuming market makers are doing the same. But here’s the twist—they try to “read” the market makers and end up losing money almost every time. On the other hand, those with access to order flow tools and some solid research make consistent gains, leaving everyone else wondering if they’re magicians.; Nvidia's lead will take years for AVGO to catch up to, and their bottleneck is currently based on supply, not demand. So just fundamentally, Nvidia's position isn't going to be threatened for a few years at least. Sure, AVGO's market share may grow, but it's virtually not going to have any impact on Nvidia's prices or growth rate.

Not even taking into account CUDA, which makes migrating existing codebases away from Nvidia cards harder, and in as tight of a race as AI is right now, I really doubt that any of the current big names are going to bounce and lose short term progress, even if it was beneficial in the long term. That basically locks in most current AI companies except for who? Amazon, Apple, 1 other?

The real winner here, unambiguously, is the Fabs. You can develop as many custom AI chips as you want, but if you can't produce enough of them to sell to your customers, it won't matter. Developing the facilities and workforce needed to produce the chips at scale takes billions.; I'm in at 85 avg cost.

Why? Seemed like a great opportunity to buy a couple years ago a company with massive potential that had not yet really taken off like many of its peers. Bought a similar amount of QCOM at the same time for same reason. And recently, a few months ago upped my position in AMZN wondering why they were lagging others. Those last 2 with really nice gains but no super pump yet. 

Will any pump like NVDA? Who knows. But once a stock is done sucking the oxygen from the room, others get to breathe. 

The next big with multibag potential play? Looking at HON and their quantum tech.; ASICs and CUDA GPUs involve separate languages and therefore separate environments.; Not really competitors from what I understand.  Whether the market understands that though remains to be seen.  You think the old greybeards even understand the internet let alone the intricacies of AI chips? ; Because MM wanted to make sure all NVDA calls expire worthless. It’ll pump next week.; Knowledgeable? The fuck is that ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276); Remind me in 2 years if Brodcom managed to DEVELOPS new AI chips. By then Nvidia, AMD, Intel or others might have even better AI chips then Broadcom.; Sector rotation? maybe a large nasdaq funding name? Was a weird move on Friday.; Except it’s not a threat and the money will flow from AVGO into NVDA very soon once that fantasy blows over. Don’t get me wrong, AVGO is a huge success and will continue to dominate. But bulls got carried away and priced in “NVDA is being dethroned” which is absolutely not going to happen. Wouldn’t be surprised to see AVGO cool off (not sink) in the coming weeks while NVDA pumps to 150 after all is digested.; Looking at ratio charts makes moves like this make more sense imo.

Layers of ratios…SMH all besides recently outperformed QQQ and then QQQ outperformed SPY.  Both NVDA and AVGO greatly outpaced SMH the leader of the 3 major indexes.

So if you want to look at a comparison of the leaders of those you can then look at NVDA/AVGO on TradingView instead of looking at both charts individually as dollar ratio.

I like to swing trade on 3day candle chart.  AVGO/NVDA chart hit it’s rsi low oversold pivot back in March 2020 on 3day chart and triple topped late 2022/early 2023 at around a 4/1 ratio 4NVDA shares per 1 NVDA.  This top also had confluence with 3day 200SMA after a 3day death cross confirmation down trend.

Using rsi on the ratio chart same as you would other usd ratio charts you can see as ratio fell in downtrend rsi has held higher low uptrend and bottomed right above a 1/1 ratio and now those traders that bought 1 AVGO for 4NVDA decided it is a good time to swap some back and reposition into the next leader in a sector.

But most would say TA doesn’t work so I am sure you fundamentallies makes sense of that price action.; It might not be pumping because of China's investigation into Nvidia.; Its like comparing cars and locomotives. They both move stuff on wheels, but that’s kinda where the similarities end.

NVDA is overpriced IMO, but the competition is going to come from cloud providers: Anthropic is starting using Amazon AI chips, Google has TPUs (Apple used TPU as well), and Microsoft is not far behind with their own chips.; People confused about why NVDA not pumping while MM are selling calls and puts in an even amount.

NVDA got too popular. Optimistic bulls and hopeful bears both get slaughtered.; **Long-term: AVGO**

If the application of large language models (LLMs) continues to grow and major players shift focus from improving their models to running inference, it will signify that the promise of AI is being realized. In such a scenario, these companies will aim to minimize inference costs. To achieve this, they will collaborate with AVGO to design custom chips. The cost of programming custom chips to support deep learning frameworks like PyTorch is not prohibitive. For example, Google’s TPUs are already supported by multiple ML frameworks. Similarly, companies like Meta, OpenAI, and Amazon will not face significant hurdles in developing their own software to support their custom chips.

**Short-term: NVDA**

We are still in the early stages of AI development. Most major AI organizations are focused on improving their models, conducting experiments, and pursuing research. Currently, none of these companies have established a profitable AI product offering. Furthermore, many new companies are likely to emerge, focusing on innovative AI products. In the near future (within the next 2 to 3 years), NVIDIA will remain the preferred choice for these entities. Indie developers and smaller companies developing custom ML solutions will continue to use CUDA/ NVIDIA’s hardware ecosystem.; What is xpu?; [removed]; I mean one of the stocks is up basically 100% this year and the other was up as high as 200%. So there's that; That’s why I like smh the whole sector is red hot the next decade nvidia won’t be the only winner; Buddy been pumping for 2 years. He’s taking a break; Sell sell sell; I’m bagholding nvda here… next earnings is probably not great because of the platform transition but afterwards the magnitudes of beats should be.

It is not the only company offering specialized/ASIC solutions, either.

OK, I've read a bit more about the Broadcom XPU and it seems it expects the customer to supply the logic, i.e. a completely different business model from nVidia/INTC/AMD (though AMD does offer some customization, such as the Playstation/XBox chips). This seems to be aimed at companies deploying finalized AI products.

I see so many people posting about the next Nvidia because of some new chip a company is making. They entirely miss the point that the chip is just one piece! People don't understand the importance of CUDA and how support for Nvidia GPUs via CUDA is baked into so all ML/AI libraries at this point. Even if someone magically created a new chip that beat Nvidia's best, all of these libraries will need to be updated to support this new chip and that is not just some quick task. There will not be a new Nvidia that magically shows up. It will take years of development and community support before anyone can even come close.

You summed it up perfectly. Nvidia supplies the entire solution.; NVLink is in the node only, for large scale-out you want infiniband. Until a few months ago Infiniband couldnt scale well past 65000 gpus so AWS and Meta used Ethernet, as do most large of customers. So they buy Arista/Cisco switches instead. UEC is a superset of Infiniband features with the scalability/efficiency and cost advantage that nvidia can't provide. Additionally AVGO will have available optical on package platform years ahead of nvidia. Custom ASICs don't need CUDA so, evidently 3 ""large"" customers do not care for it. Probably because writing your own custom kernels for custom asic is better. GPU still provides flexibility, buts that's about it at this point.; IYKYK 👍; For training that's important. For inference not so much, you don't split a single inference request that costs a few cents across multiple racks.; And that's why antitrust issues be popping; U; Logically AVGO should have a short term pullback after pumping 24% in a single day, but that makes too much sense. So I should buy puts. But this market is irrational so calls would be an obvious inverse play, but since I just mentioned that on this subreddit and inverse WSB is the strongest force in the universe, I think puts is definitely the move.; Visualizing the win for you! Good luck!; Same here; Good idea to buy AVGO puts ?; Glad to see not everyone here is a regard. CUDA is by far NVIDIA’s biggest moat; IBM has Linux.  ORCL has Java.  Both not utilized.; I think we’re going to see a major shift here and CUDA is going to become less and less important for most workloads. The market is flooded with both small and large companies going after specialized inference chips. 95% of use cases in AI are or will be inference. Inference is the “how do I actually use AI” part of the equation.

I think we will continue to see NVDA dominate in training workloads where their stack will shine - computer, networking and software.

But imagine you want to simply consume models in the enterprise. Meaning you want the chat bot, document summarization, or whatever else your use case is for GenAI with models like llama. Maybe not real time video just yet. You ideally want the best bang for your buck. That might mean most energy efficient or without the bells and whistles. Inference is that use case.

So there coukd be better timing to get in.; Aye, AI; Going heavy in anything is a mistake, unless it's an index like VTI, S&P500 and/or Nasdaq100.; Nvidia and apple are good long term holds. Not a fan of a bunch of individual stocks - dangerous game. Been said a million times but a good index fund will out perform your portfolio picks all day.; I strongly believe that what we are seeing now is just the beginning of AI. Around 15 years ago, when I was in the college I used to study mnemonic web and all this stuff. I remember one of the coolest things by that time was akinator…it’s quite impressive where we are now, but there’s a lot more to come. I’d recommend some readings on Moore’s Law and the law of accelerating returns from Ray Kurzweil. I’m heavily invested in technology, mainly AI related. This thing is the future; Just saw AMD in there …. R.I.P. portfolio 😝; Say it with me - “Quantum is the New AI”; Definitely not a mistake! One of them will boom & be the new Bill Gates — just diversify so you catch the right one and recoup your losses 😅; yes unless you have an
exit strategy and understand it wont always go up. Not all the companies in it now will make it to 10 years from
 now.; Depends on what you are really asking, no one here can see the future so, could go either way. Fundementals tell you to not be too exposed to stocks in general, and certainly not Growth only, and certainly not one industry. So fundementals would say diversify with some gold, bonds, value stocks, CDs, treasuries, crypto, art, collectables, etc.; I don't think so 🤷‍♂️ it's the way of the future. You have good picks 👌; Im in the same boat and I got this advice from a friend recently. Investing heavily in one sector is dangerous for a few reasons, the most obvious one is that is could be a bubble that will pop at any time and you lose everything, or it isn’t a bubble and continues to grow exponentially but with that you likely have the scenario of a few certain stocks far outperforming the rest and with you being so far spread out, it somewhat makes it closer to a net zero in the end, with some stocks being exponential gains and others, losses. 

With that advice I’ve chosen just to focus on the big players, IONQ, RGTI etc. Whether or not that will pay off, no body knows, just as likely a small player will have some breakthrough and end up dominating. I don’t see it being a bubble though. Guess we’ll see 😃; The AI sector is strong, and Nasdaq also looks good. It’s reasonable to aim for the best possible returns. However, we should seperate our risks because we’re not bigger than the market, and the future is uncertain. You can add other sectors or ETFs to your portfolio for balance. We don't want to make a bet, our is to be investor 😀; Depends on your risk tolerance; Missed avgo; Personally, yeah. Good job but imo way too many to keep track of.; No. It's great. Everyone should have this exact same portfolio. Because everyone says so so it's good.; What does AMD have on the road map for AI? They named their new CPUs ryzen xx “ai” but they don’t have anything special for AI that other CPUs are missing. Their GPUs are not ML friendly and they already threw in the towel there. AWS just announced that AMDs server ai processors are lacking any demand so they aren’t going to buy any right now. 

AI is GPU heavy and AMD gave up there. Sure you can use the EPYCs for AI, but they’re extremely inefficient compared to NVIDIAs server GPUs; You will so regr	et this, keep all your eggs in one basket. It makes them easier to count.; I think AI will be huge in 2025.

Every customer service role is about to be replaced by AI. 

Call centres will go the way of the DoDo.

See this video and you will be shocked. A realtor meets her AI agent that clones her voice.

Industries have ups and downs, and banking on one thing never going down is just silly.; Benny that portfolio is a Nuclear Bomb.

It's time to move on to the next best thing.. quantum chips via Google; ADSK if another one I would follow, just appointed a new CFO after record returns, the dudes apparently great at his job. Excited to see what he can do.; Tesla is heavy in the S&P and already splited twice in the last few years. Overrated.; I’m overweight on the same type of stocks so I’m riding with you man; Any suggestion for an index/etf for ai?; I don’t think you’ve ever seen a bubble pop before; Bubble of what exactly? Humans using computers?

I am sure stocks will plummet eventually, no shit. But to think that AI as an industry could pop like a bubble in 2024, you must really have outdated tech knowledge. We might not have AGI, but everyone in tech and not just tech relies on it now, and the trend will only deepen.; fed keeps pumping money into the economy, haven't seen shit pop yet; People said the same thing about the internet in 1999, and they said Warren Buffett was a dinosaur who didn’t understand the new economy when he called out nosebleed valuations and said he didn’t know how to invest in those companies.  We all know how that turned out.

Now we have Warren Buffet stockpiling cash in a clear statement that he can’t find places to invest it and folks like you think we’re in a new economy.  History doesn’t always repeat, but it does rhyme and I for one am going to treat very carefully.; Well the “this time it’s different” crowd is getting louder and louder which makes me think we’re getting closer to the top.  That crowd never sees it coming and are the people that lose the most money because they won’t sell their overpriced assets on the way down.; There's more movers than that. Stock apps have allowed everyday investors to move markets, and that money adds up. There's also more locations to get financial info from. Finally, the raw amount of money in the global economy is just genuinely insane. 

15 years ago I couldn't transfer my AUD to yen and purchase a stock by just pressing ""buy"". We are in a time where people are sick and tired of everyone else fucking with their money, and many are taking investing into their own hands.; probably, every year sp500 going up like 20-30% which is just insane lmao"

Broadcom has a decrease in operating income for 2024 compared to TTM. This appears to be attributable to increased operating expenses, likely due to its acquisition of VMWare last year, although I'd appreciate if someone with more experience can confirm this.

Really useful for my rebalancing move next year.; I don’t have any input other than these numbers show how ridiculous TSLA is. Completely decoupled from reality. 

PE that is literally 4x all the others despite having the least operating income and the smallest margins. It won’t be today, and it won’t be tomorrow, but it will crash eventually.; GOOGL seems cheap; It's a remarkable feat to see 8 US companies have broken the $1 trillion barrier. This should give other regions like Europe and China pause for thought, although for Tesla and Broadcom the valuation multiple seems quite optimistic to say the least.; In my opinion, the day people stop shorting TSLA and accept that it's impossible to beat his cult is when TSLA tanks. Don't give them free money with your puts.; Kinda weird seeing AVGO valued at a higher multiple than Nvidia; $1T for $15B in operating income and $52B in revenue HAHA.; Thank you this is v helpful!; Just keep stacking them.  
I don't like TSLA but no point fighting Elon.; Macrotrends has incorrect information for Google’s operating margin. CNBC and Gurufocus have it at ~30%.  It’s definitely over 30% just from looking at the Alphabet investor relations ERs. It was 27% in Q2 2022 to Q1 2023 but not anymore. 

For some reason the operating margin numbers for Meta and Microsoft and Apple are consistent. But they are not consistent across websites for Nvidia and AVGO and Google. Maybe it’s just outdated numbers? 

Google had 32.2% operating margin in Q3 2024. They also report that they expect continued margin expansion. I believe that AVGO and NVDA stated they expect stable margins. 

I see Google margins in 2025 surpassing 35%. Mostly due to severance and relegated office space from 2023-2024 falling off the balance sheet completely.; Table updated to reflect new Macrotrends data, mostly for AVGO Q3 earning report calculations.; AVGO versus Nvidia is wild.; Remember folks, valuation doesn’t matter. Growth matters; Can you add Amd Walmart Costco Xom Lly?; The PE from AVGO and NVDA is not showing the whole picture. They are profiting from insanely high margins and hype (imo). They face much much much higher risk than Apple or Microsoft or Google; One thing really stands out for me regarding this list. Each of the companies listed produces something of value, with the exception of Broadcom.

Broadcom buys companies, leeches off customers and money, and ultimately lets the product die. They have a horrible reputation among their clients but keep them as it is frequently too difficult to move off. Definitely not a company i would ever invest into.; TSLA P/E standing out like an ugly step-sister LOL; [deleted]; > Completely decoupled from reality.

The ""momentum factor"" is strong with this one. Everyone can be a gangster in a raging bull market, but at some point (hopefully not for a while), the market will enter a correction or worse, and fundamentals will matter. I wouldn't want to be left holding the bag then.

> PE that is literally 4x all the others despite having the least operating income and the smallest margins.

Not only that, but it's also got the worst growth curve.; it crashed many times before.... but it always comes back up higher lol; Literally my first thought was that based on these numbers TSLA is so out of place.; >PE that is literally 4x all the others despite having the least operating income and the smallest margins.

Add to that it being the ""most at risk"" company. In a few years, Chinese EVs will wipe the floor with Tesla outside of the US.; Lol people have been saying this about Tesla for years. It is a major meme stock of the bets shills; The PE here is Presidency Entitlement. It is a infinite multiplier; “TSLA is a tech company” 

oh wait so are the rest of them.; My thinking is, it will either crash... Or eventually it's earnings will grow enough for it to make sense at the current level. 

They'd have to get their robotics to work first.; I keep saying it, TSLA is the perfect example of a company worth exactly how much people are willing to pay. I personally think their software is dogshit, but it's a solid platform. I'd never own one personally. The only thing that will bring that shit down is changing people's mind that Elon is some sort of genius at EVERYTHING. It's like peak Apple hype but worse. It didn't start loosing some of its shine until Steve Jobs died. I'm hoping Elon forgets Trump doesn't usually like not being the center of attention it seems and gets curb stomped for trying to over play in the political space.; Orange guy will take care of other stocks so that TSLA can’t crash.; Couldn’t agree more, recently sold out of my position at 40% profits, selling point at 425 and I couldn’t be happier. Idc if it goes up another 200% , it feels good to be able to say my portfolio is based off of fundamentals and not mass hysteria.; They’ve been saying that for 10 years bro; I agree. Willow got all the recent hype and some backlash because quantum computing won’t necessarily be coming in the next year, but Google will continue to print money for the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, I don’t think most people realize how talented their researchers and engineers are. Multiple Nobel Laureates in Physics and Chemistry this year had affiliations with Google.; What’s cheap about it is that the forward earnings estimates assume a constant operating margin when in reality Google’s operating margin will spike above 35% in 2025 due to severance and relegated office costs all falling off the balance sheet.

The analysts typically use trailing operating margin since it’s difficult to forecast margin growth. They think Google will spike CapEx for datacenters significantly again, while I don’t think it’ll be as much. 

You can see this in the 2025 estimate of $105b income even with revenue growing at 14%. Trailing $340b revenue multiplied by 1.14 = $388b in 2025. 

$388b times 0.27 margin = $105b 

However, margin in Q3 2024 was 32%. Now let’s assume that you get just 32% in 2025, $130b income. 35% margin? $140b.; Very.   They are set up really well for what is coming in the next decade.

Google is a screaming buy, IMHO.; Probably the risk of the company getting broken up in the various antitrust lawsuits; The Willow announcement and the Gemini 2.0 announcement pushed it up recently. 

It was around 20 or under 20 not long ago.; * number wise agree. 
* quick glance wise agree. Lots of thing going for them, cloud, self-driving, quantum chips, chrome, adnroid etc. 

However 2 looming risk. 1) short term monopoly law suit. This is the least of the 2 concerns, 2) bigger risk is that their bread and butter despite everything that is going on is search.  And with LLM there is finally since their IPO some real competition and threat, not saying that they will lose in terms of search but that its a real threat despite years of ""google killers"" non has come even remotely close.  Anecdotally my google search has probably drop at least 50%.; It is, buy now before Trump reverses everything Lina Kahn ever touched. It will pop when it's out of the crosshairs.; GOOG is cheaper for good reasons/risks. Their legacy search engine business is at risk long term because only old people Google. Then you have regulatory and antitrust risk. 

I realize that yes it prints money currently. But their smaller business segments will need to become much more meaningful long term.; China is too authoritarian, Europe is too regulated and lacks a combination of cheap energy, high end talent, and population growth. It's tough to see a path where those other regions ever catch the US.; China has numerous companies which make more net income than everyone on this list. 

They just are State Owned.; I remember similar thing said in first half of 2023 about nvidia.

I believe is not about current revenue , but about the future. Once the revenue realized, all valuation comes down; If you have a suggested source that I can use to obtain operating margins for all eight stocks for TTM, I can switch to that when I make my edit.; Growth doesn't matter either

Tesla isn't growing; RemindMe! 6 months; Do it yourself with chatgpt; Broadcom has surged due to their custom silicon business booming. Google is paying more money, Broadcom just added several other major customers, and has said these customers might increase their spending up to 8x in the next 3 years. 

Despite the VMware negativity they’re already making money 3 years ahead of schedule. Seems like vendor lock in is a thing and they probably get most of the revenue from a few big customers. I don’t think Redditors complaining about VMware is reflective of the success Broadcom is having.

Hock Tan is a killer. He’s a ruthless business man that might not care much about customer satisfaction but he knows how to make money and Broadcom will continue to run as long as he’s at the wheel (at least until 2027).; I think you’re conflating value in the subjective sense to the consumer and value in the capitalistic sense.

For instance, I think Meta Platforms is the poster child for terminal enshittification with pretty much all their products and acquisitions having gotten worse for the end user since they went public. I’ve personally moved away from all their products except WhatsApp, and only LLaMa seems the slightest bit appealing. That being said, I can’t deny that their balance sheet looks fantastic and that the stock is probably a solid investment.; How?; It's the corruption trade. The only reason for Tesla to be going up right now is if investors are expecting completely rampant corruption within the Trump admin, with Musk given free reign to use the government to benefit Tesla and attack his opponents. 

Which is of course what everyone with two functioning brain cells expects.; Musk is the greatest manipulator. His 44b Twitter buy turned into a brilliant investment for him which returned ten fold with the election.; Growth scoliosis; It's also embedded with the next administration, who will coddle it the next 4 yrs and keep the game going.; They're the stock embodiment of that Chumbawumba song.; You're just looking at the PE against its peers what you need to be looking at is it's PE over historical

Yes it trades rich but it pretty much always trades rich; Their dependence on Chinese sales itself is an issue. They are increasingly becoming a brand with quality issues in an industry that does require a great deal of word of mouth marketing.; If Trump raises China tariffs, China says hippityhoppity Tesla Shanghai is now my property; What US president is going to remove the tariffs on Chinese EVS and when is china going to make USA-compliant cars?; >  It's like peak Apple hype but worse.

Look how that worked out...?; I remember the Apple hype. Whatever happened to that overhyped shit company, it must have finally crashed after it lost its shine ; Meanwhile TSLA at 141. Ooof.; Worth mentioning, Google also has access to data on a scope that few companies can rival; It will be super stupid for the US government to break up Google and lose one of the most important AI innovation hub of US; I’ll lever back up when it dips below $180 in a few weeks as is typical; Only old people use Google? Completely untrue/outlandish statement.; these normie takes are why the average stock picker underperforms the market; > Their legacy search engine business is at risk long term because only old people Google. 

Is there some sort of AI bot network and/or confederacy of ""puts-holders"" that have unified to push this absolutely nonsensical viewpoint?; Chinese companies make lots of money, but their valuations are shit because no one wants to invest in them, because they can get banhammered by poohbear anytime.; Except NVDA has a higher profit margin, lower debt to capital ratio, and a PEG ratio half of AVGO. Could keep going but... lots of people don't care about these sort of things on here.; Cars would never have the same demand as GPUs like in 2023-24 and still has insane demand.
Nvda is a monopoly. More than 90% of the marketshare, the only competitor is AMD which is miles away from nvda.

And also I would always trust Jensen's promises over Elon's promises any day.; If you have $1T sitting in the bank and put it into a company that will give you $15B a year with the hopes of high growth, then I’m not sure what to tell you. 

A HYSA would give you $50B a year.; But that was right after Chatgpt was released and it was clear what a big deal LLMs would be in the future. And it was powered by Nvidia GPUs.; Nvidia was a great company in 2022.; Nah it’s okay. I just wanted to point out that the source you use seems to have different timelines for different companies. Seems like AVGO is outdated for example, but it only just released earnings.; yeah only vibes matter these days; The growth story of these eight stocks falls into four groups:

* **Insane growth**: This is NVDA with triple digit growth in revenue and operating income, even if it's starting to diminish. If you believe if we're in the earning innings of AI and that this will be profitable (*even above the already ridiculously high valuations*), which I do, then continue to hold your positions.
* **Very strong growth**:
  * GOOG, MSFT, and META: Balance sheets speak for themselves
  * AMZN: The balance sheet here reflects that AMZN has a huge retail component that operates on low margins but a growing high-margin tech component compared to GOOG, META, and MSFT. This is shown by the much higher revenue with low YoY % change, but the lower operating income with the high YoY % change.
  * AVGO: I would classify this as strong growth based on the growth in revenue despite the decreased operating income, because this is accounted for by the operating expenses. I'm pretty sure this is all attributable to their acquisition costs from VMWare (which is also why their trailing PE is in the 100s).
* **Minimal growth**: AAPL is a very mature company with a robust revenue stream but basically no revenue or income growth for 3 years. I view it more of a ""value"" stock despite a P/E in the 30s (in fact, so does Avantis). I'm enthusiastically buying new Apple devices for this current upgrade cycle, but I suspect I'm in the minority among consumers.
* **Flat to negative growth**: TSLA has had flat revenues but negative income growth for the past several years as margins have shrunk, partly due to decreased EV demand and increased competition both domestically and abroad. This trend may have begun to slightly reverse itself on a quarterly basis, largely driven by energy credits, although not nearly back to its 2022 heights. To really have any meaningful growth (let alone spectacular growth implied by these valuations), TSLA bulls would have to hope for one of three things:  (1) actual meaningful progress on robotaxi after 10 years, (2) significantly increased EV sales, or (3) Elon Musk's political connections positively impacting the balance sheet by diverting revenue and income into company shareholders.; I will be messaging you in 6 months on [**2025-06-14 17:55:23 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2025-06-14%2017:55:23%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hdxxw6/broadcom_avgo_broke_the_1t_barrier_heres_how_it/m21nvbn/?context=3)

|-|-|-|-|; Not confusing it at all. I think broadcom is a ticking time bomb for customers to bail on them.

For the people I work with, as soon as they hear that broadcom buys a product they use they immediately start finding replacements.

My company started replacing VMware the day after broadcom bought them. 

They are horrible at managing products and product lines and that is not a company I'd ever invest in.; Until they have a falling out; Meh, you overestimate the impact Twitter has. Not so many people use it.; You think that was musk? he's the puppet, not the puppeteer, lol; Still wasn’t super cheap. He could’ve gotten Twitter for cheaper according to Dorsey. 

Elon gained $150b from Trump win but that could easily flip if Congress cuts EV and Battery tax credits. That would kill Tesla; Oh, Danny Boy

Danny Boy; > If Trump raises China tariffs, China says hippityhoppity Tesla Shanghai is now my property

I mean, very few people trust the Chinese government to respect private ownership rights, so they might as well just shred whatever reputation they have left.; Polestar and Volvo are Chinese owned, Swedish originally, but geely bought it during the financial recession.

Polestar makes one car here and Volvo makes others, but they’re looking at bringing more models in.; All that is irrelevant if Chinese companies dominate the rest of the world. The American market may be large, but a fraction of the entire world. And EVs are not even particularly popular in the US, compared to places like Norway.; > What US president is going to remove the tariffs on Chinese EVS and when is china going to make USA-compliant cars?

A U.S. President would have to be a complete moron to gut our automotive industry (which represents a national security interest) by allowing illegally subsidized, quasi-governmental Chinese car companies to predatory-dump vehicles into our market.

Maybe Trump will remove the tariffs.; Go look at their sales. They pretty much haven't had an original idea in a while except some insignificant update. They are black berry before apple knocked their teeth out.; Google and Amazon know so much about us that it's frightening.

Facebook is, too, but everybody should have seen that coming.; I'd be thrilled but I think it shoots past $200. The sentiment has completely shifted; I could comment but:

https://www.wsj.com/tech/googling-is-for-old-people-thats-a-problem-for-google-5188a6ed; Great, you should be all set to load up on Goog then and prove me wrong. Best of luck,; Broadcom is trading on the TAM growth potential for ASICs. There are only two players: Broadcom and Marvell; no, keep going. Dont stop cooking now; What’s hilarious is that global auto demand is relatively flat. The USA sells and produces fewer vehicles than it did in 2000. Same for 2015.; Time to short TSLA; Most big VMW customers have a big problem on their hands. Very big investments needed to get off VMW platform - which are not in their operational plans. If you make these, you take away from something else more strategic. 

I feel, many big customers will whine and then get in line.; How so; That kills everyone but Tesla.

Tesla has positive returns without rebates. It would hurt but it would not threaten its existence. Meanwhile, The other American EV makers go from bad to BK.; Chinese-owned but not Chinese market. Tesla won't have problems competing in the Western market. It's the inexpensive China standard evs are the threat. We are never opening the market to those.; Can’t read the article (paywall) but based on metrics that are available, looks like an opinion piece as the vast majority still use Google. 
Certainly not only old people. I mean you could ask people yourself and verify that’s not the case so if the author is making that point, that’s a bad hill to die on.; The [author of that article](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DLPHWe9UMAAtnUX.jpg) looks exactly like what I expected him to be ... a San Francisco tech-hipster.; What are your short positions on GOOG?; I think its completely detached from reality. It seems like the only key advantage to ASICs is for the person who ONLY wants to mine one thing ever, and the fact that said person doesn't have to compete with the rest of the world for the normal GPUs. Or perhaps its pure speculation that a lot of the cons to ASICs will go away in the future.

Completely unpopular opinion, and in the short term  AVGO may make some good money for share holders, but long term, I feel better with NVDA based on financials, and those same financials show AMD is undervalued. Eventually fundamentals come back to reality.; Surely the sensible play is TSMC?; Nvidia also is an ASIC player. 

They just have GPUs which do the job better; Manufacturers saw what people paid during Covid and raised the price, a lot of people are priced out.; Thanks for the premium.; Oh, so you think bes manipulating saudi and putin etcetcetc, not the other way around? Thats laughable; This is false. 

“Everyone else” among Big Auto makes ~3% of the EVs in the USA. They lose on each EV produced. They make all their profit on non-EVs. Why would not producing another EV be bad for them? 

Tesla makes 100% of its money from EVs. Losing $7.5k of incentive per vehicle will hurt them 95% of the time.; Ok? They’re based in Silicon Valley and it’s still the world’s tech hub.; Asic does compete with GPU in AI sector and that's why amd and nvda went down post AVGO earning l. Asic is much cheaper both in price and A LOT cheaper in power consumption.; Yes TSMC is a big winner and is a stock you hold forever. However it will always trade at a lower PE because of geopolitical risk.; When has he interacted with them; I must have outdated information because the article I read said ASIC was higher. At any rate, the dip for nvda, and amd should only be temporary. NVDA is sold out and still ramping up. Curious yo see how the fundamentals change for AVGO because at the moment, they're absolutely garbage.; ASICs cannot compete with Nvidia because the Nvidia ecosystem is CUDA. AMD technically also competes in the CUDA ecosystem. The ASICs like TPUs and Microsoft’s MAIA don’t. 

If you care about future Nvidia growth, you care about the CUDA market.; Pretty widely reported he has frequent calls with Putin. He didn't deny it either. The Saudis were big investors in Tesla at first and they own a stake in Twitter. He was also hanging with them and Murdoch in Qatar at the FIFA cup. He's pretty involved with quite a few dictators and terrible people.

Edit: Not saying I agree with the guy just that he isn't wrong on that specific point.; Yes; Damn bruh mad emotional while ain't knowing nuttin; Triton, openXLA, already tons of alternatives. Cuda is a pile of shits , it’s only advantages by now is that it’s the early player, but technical wise, the code is just shit; Bot tier comment; Tell that to literally every AI engineer outside Google; I’m a ML engineer in Meta. I can confirm and many of my colleagues can confirm. And I have a friend working in distributed system in nvidia. We all agree that cuda isn’t good. Its monopoly status doesn’t imply it’s good. Others are catching up. Yea, it’s true that we still use it as first choice. But It just matter of time. Even PyTorch is going through a re-wire right now to become more agnostic to the compiler."
114,AAPL taking a breather,"# 📊 AAPL Technical Breakdown and Small Account Challenge

I’ve been analyzing **Apple's (AAPL)** charts, and here’s what I’m seeing:

1. **Technical Indicators:**
   * Upward trend **broke below and retested** before showing signs of heading lower.
   * **Bearish death candle** on the daily chart.
   * A **Head and Shoulders** pattern on the 1-hour chart.
2. **Indicators:**
   * **RSI** is signaling **overbought** conditions.
3. **Fundamentals:**
   * The **PE ratio** is significantly **above its 10-year average**.

It needs a breather after the recent rocket run it's had from $219 to $250 in 25 days. That's a **12% increase** in **market cap in 25 days?!** How does that make sense?

Given this, I’m predicting a pullback to **$244** before a bounce or further direction. Current price: **$248**.

# 📝 How I’m Trading This:

I’m in a **spread trade** to maximize safety and minimize cost:

* **Sell $245 strike** and **buy $247.50 strike** as insurance.

This spread costs **$86** in risk for a potential **$164 profit** if AAPL dips below $245 by expiration. With these indicators lining up, it’s a **solid risk/reward** play.  
  
I’m documenting this in my **Small Account Challenge**: taking my account from **$500 to $1,000,000**. 📈

116,$YY - The Chinese Social Media App That’s Already Banned,"TLDR: The Bigo Live app has been taken down by Apple and Google for **allowing sales of child porn.** The Bigo Live app is about 80% of $YY’s revenue - and this hasn’t been reported widely - the stock has barely moved

**Overview**

On December 5th, Bigo Live was removed from both the iOS and Android app stores [following reports in the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/07/us/child-abuse-apple-google-apps.html?unlocked_article_code=1.hE4.IjV3.IUb4nn1olfoc&smid=url-share.) of the app allowing users to pay to watch livestreams of child sexual abuse. The app is still gone (search in your app store)

Joyy ($YY) is a Chinese social media company that gets most of its revenue from the Bigo Live app.

This doesn't seem to be covered anywhere related to $YY - for example [on Marketwatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/yy). Presumably because this is a small-cap Chinese stock no one cares about. The stock is down about 3.5% since the news was reported.

**$YY Revenue Breakdown**

Looking at their [Q3 Earnings](https://ir.joyy.com/news-releases/news-release-details/joyy-reports-third-quarter-2024-unaudited-financial-results) \- **BIGO apps are about 90% of their profit and revenue.**

https://preview.redd.it/brtjouauun6e1.png?width=2470&format=png&auto=webp&s=acbab4e2f3d59058a5122617570cd816c282991e

Two other apps, IMO and Likee are under BIGO here - but are about 10% of the total revenue

https://preview.redd.it/nqwbr0ftun6e1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5d7825599fc604c48519989febd05ba84e07877

So Bigo Live alone should be around 80% of $YY’s revenue and profit.

It’s worth noting that average revenue per paying user over the quarter was **$231** \- their content clearly monetized well.

They do have a website - [bigo.tv](http://bigo.tv) \- but I suspect it’s a small portion of their revenue. They don’t break out the data in their last [annual report](https://ir.joyy.com/static-files/de629d35-c15e-4046-82d7-856fddbd1d41) but they do say

>We primarily rely on thirdparty application distribution channels, such as the iOS App Store and the Google Play Store, to allow users to download and access our applications and games.

[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse); have to get this news picked up more over the weekend it seems; # **TLDR**

---

**Ticker:** YY

**Direction:** Down

**Prognosis:** Short

**Reason:** Bigo Live, which accounts for ~90% of YY's revenue, was removed from app stores for facilitating child sexual abuse.  Stock price barely reacted, presenting a short opportunity.  Author is already short 1000 shares.

**Additional Note:**  The author believes the company's actions are morally reprehensible and the stock should be worthless.; Just loaded on $35p 12/20; Now how do we get news papers to report on this to help it get to its lower deserved price point…..; Super weird it hasn't reacted. P72 is largest holder in 13Fs. They've been selling down the position (as of 9/30, so maybe they're out). But if some pod shops are involved they're definitely getting very frequent updates on app usage and downloads. This would have been flagged by now. 

They only owned like $80mm in shares, however. So could be only a few small positions across groups that have already been dumped. Not something they can trade in size. Still interesting though.

Edit: Great flag and DD OP. Checked Sensortower data. It's definitely inactive everywhere.; bought some 01/17 puts too; shorting low float Chinese stocks is recipe for disaster. at least use options; Cases like this show why shorting isn't always bad; My sister works in the financial media. She is going to reach out to her connects at Bloomberg; Deplorable.; Bought puts, fuck em!; The company's name is literally Joyy... ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260); Fascinating wonder how the broader market did not pick up on this, anyway I'm short 100 shares.; Option chain today is alllll puts at the ask; Jesus christ that's awful.; Already down 2% after hours; Thanks for the dd. Bought puts.; fuck that company, why aren’t the execs in prison?; I’m in on Monday.; Down almost 10% today. Good find op; its back on the playstore\*; Goodness gracious. This is horrible and so sad. How does this company continue to operate and trade on the public markets? 

I bought puts. 

Thanks for sharing this. First, we hope this company goes down. Second, we will make money when it does.; im in. f this company.; Why not puts OP?; I’m in too 25p 1/17; **12-11-2024(mm/dd/year) UGPIX dumped 20.51% of ownership**  
**11-29-2024 Tiff Investment opened short positions. ironically dec 2 2024** there was a **minishort squeeze** that happened with a **600k+ volume, today(12-13-2024)** has the same **volume but in a sell majorit**y. looking at the daily chart seems to be forming a bull flag but if in the next coming days this comes to break that then a flush to **35.22** is imminent considering theres also a gap left open there.; It seems shit is finally started hitting the fan.

[https://x.com/WolfpackReports/status/1869390477918863848](https://x.com/WolfpackReports/status/1869390477918863848); Up 1000% today; The stock is up 10.54% today. Such is humanity I guess.; holy shit I read the article and they only took down this app. The other FOUR apps they mentioned are all still up. No surprise the FBl doesn't care when American corporations get to profit off this; Great find OP

I'm gonna play Devil's Advocate here because we need to look at this trade objectively

The app getting banned from play store and app store makes getting new users difficult but existing users can still use the app. Their competitors have been banned too. So, these new users aren't completely lost to them. They can still be captured if the app gets re-instated.

I doubt these bans are permanent. They'll probably come with new moderation policies and procedures in a few weeks and claim they've addressed the issue. Unless there's political pressure on Apple and Google, I dont see why the app won't get reinstated once they clean up.; Im too dumb for options and only approved for covered. Guess i cant participate in the put party; https://preview.redd.it/ch13zd0wfo6e1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1f7d6e454ddfcc23864ba67e94558936ec0eb459

I have no idea what I'm doing. Can I go negative with this? Or is what I put in the max I can lose?; !remindme 2d; Kinda odd how the stock hasn't been affected by such a horrible news; [https://x.com/search?q=%24YY&src=cashtag\_click&f=live](https://x.com/search?q=%24YY&src=cashtag_click&f=live)

I'm still holding my puts; Ayyy, let's go boys. Good shit OP. Let this m'fer burn.; Apparently not the first time it has happened. You can find cases of it before and it being removed. Hopefully it does momentarily drop for the puts to print but based on what's happened before they will probably be back; This also just plays into the ""China bad"" narrative, which is nice.; And my axe! 75 x Feb21 30P; !remindme 2d; Just bought 40 DEC / Jan puts. Hope this gets picked up in time. Anyone have connects to the media?; Oh well. Here's to hoping something shitty happens to them by May.; I had to sell today, sadly. Anyway, I secured a 25% profit somehow. Thank you, OP!; I think there is still a possibility that Apple rejects to restore Bigo Live. That would be quite a big blow. Especially when prices are back to $40-ish it couldn't go higher than that basically, so there's no downside to short the stock.; This honestly should be pinned on the front page of WSB. Insane that this stock isn't in the ground.; [deleted]; They can be strangely resilient these companies. This is not enough to bring them down. They will just offer the app APK download via their website. Active users who crave their content will just update using APK.; Price action is anemic. Without media coverage it won’t budge; Funnily, it seems it was me whose complaint got Big Live removed from Microsoft Store. They send me an email about that. I'll that with Google tomorrow just for fun. The thesis stands -- they are still not restored in Apple Store.; Solid DD op. In with $30 puts 5/16; good DD op. I agree with you here. I entered a position on Friday and just exit’d at $39.00. 

I did more research over the weekend and this has happened multiple times in the past. I am afraid this won’t impact them much long term, perhaps a re-listing within 2-3 weeks is already weighed into the market price.; Huh apparently this does not affect the existing users, the app is only taken down to prevent new users from signing up. Could affect earning and guidance but a big drop is unlikely.; Wait but this news is super old??? It was removed 3 or 4 years ago.; Party pooper

There are 60 million shares overall. As of 30 sept 2024 they announced $3,302.1 million in cash, or $55/share in cash.

As long as they break even... the shares are undervalued.; Someone just needs to mail this to a Trump staffer and it’ll blow up on Fox; Good bot; Copied that; Did the same. Puts...70; I bought 6x $35p 12/20 as well, it’s strange that even though the stock is down to 38.xx the puts haven’t been gaining and are stuck at .28 ; Same; why so soon?; Can you share more?; Nice! I hope the pick it up quickly.; Thanks! Doing God's work; Any updates on this? should be pretty huge news imo; Chinese company with ""HQ in Singapore"" but really its still in China; And back again to $38. A very resilient stock.; Yes it's back but video reels no longer work ; The spreads are pretty awful ngl ; Spreads aren't great for puts, also wasn't sure how long this would take to spread.; Squeeze deez nuts you fuckin nerd.

It reminds me of Roblox. Hindenburg Research dropped a hit piece about them. The price? It's up 25% since then.; Damn bro… they got relisted on play store; Baidu paid them $1.9 billion for the YY.com (chinese social media) acquisition that baidu has since pulled out of - they'll have to pay that back - you can see it under liabilities on their balance sheet. See their financials https://ir.joyy.com/news-releases/news-release-details/joyy-reports-third-quarter-2024-unaudited-financial-results; Came here to say this; That's definitely possible - but 65% of their app revenue is from iOS which mostly doesn't allow third party downloads. 



https://app.sensortower.com/ios/publisher/publisher/940017134 ($9 Million in revenue last month)

https://app.sensortower.com/android/publisher/publisher/Bigo%2BTechnology%2BPte.%2BLtd. ($5 million in revenue last month); I was also thinking this.  I want to get puts and ride this fucker to zero.  But if there's a website and an apk I don't know if revenue will take a significant hit, growth and public perspective yes but the money will still roll in.; Agree here - know anyone who might be interested in covering it?; Yes, ntm with their share buybacks they can keep this up forever; I believe existing users transactions won't work. Not sure if this is true for ios but it is true for android. Would be curious if you knew; No? Read the article it was removed like a week ago now; Baidu paid them $1.9 billion for the YY.com (chinese social media) acquisition that baidu has since pulled out of - they'll have to pay that back - you can see it under liabilities on their balance sheet. See their financials https://ir.joyy.com/news-releases/news-release-details/joyy-reports-third-quarter-2024-unaudited-financial-results; This! Trump will destroy any CHINA apps; Can someone screenshot and post to X or Truth Social to get broader attention on this?; Me too; Short squeeze i wld guess; In the green now....; Honestly, there were some good ones. I picked up May 17 '25 $30 puts for $1.40.; Yeah i was looking at the spreads had a bit of hope they were mispriced like achr. But them puts are pricy.; pun intended?; There's a need for us to start talking about it. Any company profiting off the sexual exploitation of kids should not even exist in the first place!; You are forgetting about Likee. Bigo is not their only app. They earn much advert revenue from Likee. And it is still growing. They are not going under with loss of Bigo. What they will likely do is to get themselves reinstated or create another similar app.; I reposted an abridged version on twitrer, stockwits and after hours app (social network for traders). Am going to try to mention YY on SeekingAlpha.

Will try to reach out to project Hindenburg and such, maybe they get interested.

I wonder if Joyy violates some Nasdaq listing requirements by… you know… enabling CP distribution. A super long shot, but hey it won’t hurt to lodge a complaint to Nasdaq or even SEC.

No guarantee we'll find a good fill on the way out though. it's a super illiquid chain. Realizing ITM would have been the way to go. If it doesn't move it would at least ensure you can recover on the intrinsic value.; We can actually break this revenue down 

From their Q3 earnings

https://ir.joyy.com/news-releases/news-release-details/joyy-reports-third-quarter-2024-unaudited-financial-results

Total revenue for their BIGO segment (Bigo, Likee, and IMO) was 496 million. 

Of that, 418 million was ""livestreaming."" 

So 85% of BIGO segement revenue last quarter was livestreaming - short form video is a very small part of their business.; Reddit (the company, not r/WallStreetBets, the subreddit) has banned Seeking Alpha articles everywhere on Reddit.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*; Gj seems like you did something, or the timing aligned xD; UPD:  
I sent emails to Hindenburg Research, Culper Research. Ofc, it would take a time even they GET interested, but still. Also lodged a complaint to fucking NASDAQ urging them to investigate $YY if it's in compliance with the listing requirements. Lol. Probably it's all in vain, but at least I did something.

Any ideas are appreciated; Same here. Someone - this is your time to be a hero! Spread this far and wide. 

OP walked so you can run.; And if it does play before earnings, then I will exit prior to earnings because the speculation and uncertainty will likely have already done enough damage to be profitable. IV leading into earnings will increase if this hits before then.; True, but I think the premium is decent given if it doesn't hit the news cycle until after earnings. An investigation report or other news cycle prior to then will offer a haircut, but this has to impact earnings I would think. I don't know, I just think the put protection is more time in case this takes a while to play out.; Lol; Email the compliance departments and boards of owners like FMR.; Need to see more people talking about this than us! Quiet weekend on the update front. No pickup.; When is the next earnings? ; It definitely will impact earnings. Just looked through the most recent [presentation](https://ir.joyy.com/static-files/f4a7ccbb-07e6-412b-952b-1ace063940dd).

Live streaming is indeed 80% of revenues (which MAU and spend are already trending downward).

I'm plugged in with a few small cap L/S funds. I'll be floating this around in January if price doesn't seem to be reacting. Might help get the narrative out there.; An interesting idea! However, I cannot seem to find their compliance email address. I found a post on Reddit with the same request basically. As was suggested in that post, I sent to r/fidelityinvestments's mods lol.

I'm thinking Martin Shkreli might be interested in this opportunity.; Mar. 24, '25.; You're the GOAT. There is a seeking alpha piece touting growth posted on the 10th I was thinking about commenting on. I'm just a simpleton though. Haha.; There's growth in the short-form video segment. But the core business is in decline and new platform aims to compete with TikTok... Good luck. It's a dumpster fire with a pile of cash to burn at this point.; The stock is still trading below its cash value though. Even in the event that the news cycle blows up, how much can we realistically expect this to decrease in a short time frame? (Say for an options play); Tough to say really. Baidu also broke off the acquisition of their Chinese TikTok clone they bought in 2021, that's a huge piece of the cash balance. Short report that came out today mentions this. They say they might need to return $1.4B, but I read through the merger docs last week and wasn't able to find what the break up fee would be.

I wouldn't be optimistic of $YY getting the upper hand in a legal battle. But I also don't know anything about M&A law in China.



But even if it's $2B pile of cash. I highly doubt they maintain profitability following this. Advertisers won't want to work with them going forward if the app is re-instated. Their SG&A expenses are ~$200M/quarter, so they won't be around long. Key risk to short thesis would be they get the short-form video app back and it's actually highly profitable. I have my doubts here though about long-term viability of it, however."
117,"TSMC 2024 results solid, 2nm tech progressing well, AI business outlook closed","In November 2024, TSMC sales reached $8.834 billion, up 34 per cent year-on-year

This year-on-year decline has sparked market concerns about data centre build-outs, although overall demand for AI chips remains strong

The cumulative total for January to November 2024 was $83.717 billion, up 31.8 per cent year-on-year

With Bloomberg analyst Charles Shum noting that TSMC dominance in pricing power has further solidified its market

Although November sales were slightly below my forecast (up 36.3% y/y)

TSMC technological progress on the 2nm process has been impressive. The company has been working on the 2nm process at its Hsinchu Baoshan plant and expects to reach a monthly capacity of 20,000 wafers completed by the end of 2025 for the N2 process. Although the current yield of 2nm chips is 60%, which is lower than the 70% standard required for large-scale mass production, TSMC plans to formally enter the mass production stage in 2025, which is expected to be the future of high-end chips

With the recent surge in Apple's stock price, Apple is one of TSMC important customers, a media revealed that Apple products with 2nm chips 2026 iPhone 19 series is expected to be equipped with 2nm memory

Apple's iPhone 17 series will continue to use TSMC 3nm process based A19/Pro processor

However, TSMC future remains full of potential thanks to its leading position in 2nm process technology and its close cooperation with large customers such as Apple. The continued growth of its AI business and the mass production of high-end chips are expected to bring strong revenue growth to the company, and the stock is expected to have significant upside in the future.

Compared to Samsung, TSMC is leading the way in terms of 2nm process yields and technological advances. Samsung's 2nm chips currently have yields of around 10-20 per cent, while TSMC is expected to start mass production of its 2nm chips in 2025 and become a key technology supplier for Apple products. This has led TSMC to receive increasing attention in the global semiconductor market

As a long-term investor, TSMC AI business revenue is expected to grow by 30-40 per cent in 2025. As demand for AI chips expands, TSMC will continue to benefit from technological advances and growing market demand. I personally expect TSMC shares to reach $240 by March 2025, mainly due to its strong market position and future growth potential",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hditzk/tsmc_2024_results_solid_2nm_tech_progressing_well/,33,2024-12-13 19:31:03,"

[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse); If Intel had a hope of catching up to TSMC with 18A, they just killed it by firing Gelsinger and promoting board members that want to scrap the new fabs. TSMC stands alone atop the semi manufacturing mountain.

We're talking about a company where fat-margin monopolists like Apple, NVidia, Google, and Qualcomm are going to have to stand in line and try to outbid each other for wafers. It's an uber-bullish situation for $TSM.

I'm a doombear who thinks that stocks are grossly overvalued, bonds are grossly overvalued, real estate is grossly overvalued, crypto is worthless, continued economic growth is impossible, every G7 government will financially collapse by 2050, and capitalism as we know it will soon end. But god damn it, TSMC is my conviction play.; I am confident that TSMC will reach new heights; [removed]; And then, enter Trump, the guy who says we need to scrap the CHIPS act and just put tariffs on the companies making chips to get them to build here, and even singling out Taiwan by name, and then you have a pretty convincing argument that the top is in.; Written by bad AI.

""up 34 per cent year on year.""

""this year in year decline""; Orange or not.  ASML - 2 nm wouldn’t happen.

Also it’s a safer play for anyone who’s afraid of invasion from china. This year was a bit disappointing, but has to do with everything non-ai, which will start going up again in 2025 and 2026.; I agree with you that if tsmc wants to climb higher then he has to work with the right people; Why would Trump increase Taiwan tariffs? ; Why does Trump do anything? 


He's been ranting for years about how Taiwan ""stole"" chip manufacturing from the US, and how they don't pay the US for military protection from China.  "

May I introduce you to AMD?; Probably make more money buying 500 shares wmt pre earnings; This is triggering.  I am triggered.; This just shows that everything is massively overbought, for something to rise other has to fall. This doesn't happe in a normal market where all semis would have been up today, instead you see maximized movements where there are things exploding up and other tanking hard.; NVDA employees say otherwise![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260); Nvidia is the pussiest stock I ever met; Sold 45k of AVGO at 179 and I’m about to go postal; [deleted]; Broadcomm is a bloody terrible company.

Long the stock, short the management.; The market is cleaning out all the naive 0DTE NVDA option gamblers. You should feel good about being long on NVDA - the market will eventually reward you as long as you don't sell early.

All the whining now about NVDA is primarily from those that gambled their dead grand-mother's money on short term options.  The big funds are all taking advantage of that pain by loading up on cheap, salty tear-soaked shares.; Well you are buying Nvidia at the top, what do you expect?; Sounds like someone is late to the NVDA party.

The market already knows NVDA is gonna crush it. The key thing is beyond 2026 numbers.; Great meme.

The Apple-AVGO deal, which was announced a day prior to AVGO’s earnings, clearly signaled increased competition for NVIDIA. This was a foreseeable development, and the outcome reflects insufficient research on your part.

It's wild that NVDA earns in a quarter what AVGO earns in a year and NVDA is down but AVGO up 20%. 🙃; AMD hasn't held a green day for at least two months lol, there's no comparison; I used to think NVDA would be the first company to 4 trillion, but it seems like AAPL is right there almost. So AAPL probably has that.

I still think NVDA will be the first to 5 trillion; Yeah, it’s rough man. It’s a blip and I wouldn’t have sold it, but I get it. We can now see gain porn here for all the degens who gambled on an ER play; NVDA is worth more than 3x what AVGO is. NVDA is going down because investors see higher growth stocks to invest in because how much can NVDA grow when it's almost the most valuable company in the world already.; You really just gotta throw up your hands sometimes 😂 I mean besides Nancy pelosi idk many who expected moves like this from AVGO right now; Were all regarded; One is a rollercoaster, the other a slide?; Just tell me it’ll hit 146 again 😢; Stock just formed a head & shoulders pattern on the 5d chart… so I think 146 not going to happen any time soon"

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Iron ore spot price is not great but it's a lot higher than in the mid 2010s when it was crashing and burning (e.g. $40 per ton vs today's $100). VALE has a marginal cost in the low $20s per ton. There are many producers that quickly get priced out / bankrupted if iron ore keeps falling.

They are at 3.8x forward EV/EBITDA, lower than their peers. They did somewhere around $7-8B in FCF last 12 months. 10.8% dividend yield.

With AVGO being up 32% in my account would yall recommend I sell? My current account is sort of learning, but also somewhat of a savings in case I need it, so I’m not planning to hold anything long term.; Was the 2% inflation goal transitory?; I’m 70% cash with GOOG being my largest single holding at this point. 

Buffett might have been early cashing out this year but I doubt he’ll end up being wrong.; [deleted]; ""Mexico's antitrust watchdog Cofece ruled that Walmex, the local unit of U.S.-based retail giant Walmart , engaged in a monopolistic practice related to its suppliers, the company said in a statement on Friday.

People who realize it’s not “a retailer”?; Sold the rest of my PSIX holdings for 80% gain. I kinda wish I had sold off more at the top, but I didn't anticipate investor confidence collapsing so quickly.

Hoping for a nice flush, I'll buy at 80.; How long did it take you to reach that first 100k in your brokerage?; The Bloomberg article that Elon is worth $400B is likely false. This likely stems from when he had 25% equity in Tesla back in 2021, but he's since sold a lot to pay for Twitter.

His latest [form 4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000089924322038522/xslF345X03/doc4.xml) shows he has 423.6M TSLA shares, and [Tesla's 2023 10-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828024002390/tsla-20231231.htm) shows an outstanding share count of 3184.8M. Thus, Elon has only 423.6/3184.8 = 13.3% equity in Tesla, which at it's current $1.34T market cap, means his position is valued around $178B.

He certainly has some equity in other notable companies, particularly SpaceX, but he doesn't like have more than $25B. Therefore, his net worth is more like $200B. A far cry from $400B.; There are Michael Burrys everywhere lately. Best to ignore them, keep looking for opportunities.; They gained AMD's entire market cap in one day.

Advanced Money Destroyer indeed (I don't believe AMD is a bad company, but the slander name is too good to pass up).; Well one of the stocks is up 25%; Rotation into Tesla continues 🤷; I'd say it's time to invest in ex-US. 

When you have AVGO missing on revenue and going up 25% you know things are frothy.; I am not sure I exactly understand what I'm supposed to be seeing in this chart. But I thought maybe it would be useful to compare this take to my position on global diversification as a Canadian. Most of my global diversity is from the XEF etf, which ""tracks a market-cap-weighted index of developed-market stocks in Europe, Australasia, and Far East, and excludes the US and Canada."" 

I invest separately in Canada and America, and include a ~20% share in this non-NA. It's YTD is 15% (and only 6.36% over 3 years), which seems noticeably better than this Non-US equities chart. Even though it has not performed anywhere near US, it still seems a lot better than what this chart is showing. 

So is the poor performance of this above Non-US ETF about including Canada? Or is it that my fund is only ""Developed"" markets and not all-global? (I also have a separate smaller ~6% share in ""Emerging"" markets, and ~1.25% ""Frontier"" markets.)

Ultimately, I think there might be value in blaming particular sections of ""Global"" ETFs rather than as a whole.

**(TLDR: Why is my Global allocation doing a lot better? Summary below)**

* Canada (XIC) - 24.55% YTD
* Developed (XEF) - 14.35% YTD
* Emerging (ZEM) - 18.03% YTD
* Frontier (FM) - 9.34% YTD; Honestly, out of a select few individual picks it's nigh-impossible to invest outside the U.S.; Why would you bother?? Honestly.

China hates their own stock market.

Europeans hate their own economy with passion. 

Only game in the town right now is US, frankly ... there's nothing else.; Lots of single stocks are performing well (games workshop, swissquote, siemens energy, ...) though the ex-US basket is doing terribly atm.; There's definitely some good names out there, but broad markets are in the dumpster right now.; Yeah I feel the same way on a daily basis. Conventional wisdom says someday, things will revert to the mean, but man has it been awful run since 2008 for ex-US.; Tsmc and bti are my ex us. Both doing well over the past year; Why bother? Because diversification. Nobody should be buying global to beat the US market.; Her AVGO call options are enough to pay the bills.; Me no like this company. Gives me an eerie vibe.; I was really hoping for it to fall under $400 again so I could pick up more. I was too late for the flash dip on Tuesday; What an awful chart.  I like it!  These are the stocks that are going to kick ass in 2025 if they can deliver.  

In my watch list, thank you.  :); I'm heavy here. Dieing for a run back to 200; I really have no idea what it’s about but lots of people are talking if it’s risks. What are those risks what is the debt burden what other relevant info you got to share?; lol no it’s not. 

So many risks for QCOM; Go for it. I don't think there is anything wrong with speculation or going risk on, especially if you are basically using house money. 

Plus it seems like you have success with beaten down names and just waiting.; How is inflation bearish on gold? I thought people would buy it as a hedge against inflation.; Movement down or up ?; weird as this sounds, I actually like it. I am not a crypto bull (though I've \*always\* liked it's potential), and I tend to see it happening in cycles

if it truly is just a flash in the pan, then the NASDAQ will benefit from it, then discard after a year or two

I like the idea of having a small stake in a high risk asset decoupled from the S&P (even if it sometimes seems to track it)

edit: I only keep NASDAQ in my Roth atm; I'm sure everything will be fine if there's a downturn given that amount of bull leverage in the market.; SE  or  NVCR  I bought more of both today; If I had dry powder, I'd be buying more AMD; AVGO, PLTR; Wanted to short that one since a while.. my broker doesn't allow it 😱  guess, I should thank him?; Especially when their main selling point is lower prices when they usually aren’t the cheapest. And you have to buy so much. 

More and more people are single. The Costco model of forcing people to buy so much and waste most of it is outdated. And bad for the environment. ; They'll probably due well in early part of next year with all the tax loss harvesting at the end of this year.; Likewise. But for years for me.  I finally cut bait when they announced spinning off the biz they acquired 3 years ago and crowed about all the efficiencies….  Thanks for the tax help, fellas; a brutal sell off; I’d say so. Any winning trades above 20% I tend to sell off, reevaluate and look at new trades. Typically take the profit and put into VOO or SCHD, go back to the research.; You do you man, but personally I don't think it makes sense for people just to follow Buffet all the time. Birk has like 1T worth of assets. 

Even Buffet himself talks about Cash not being great. 

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-once-called-investment-124400339.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-once-called-investment-124400339.html)

>In a 2008 op-ed for The New York Times, Buffett warned, “Today people who hold cash equivalents feel comfortable. They shouldn’t. They have opted for a terrible long-term asset, one that pays virtually nothing and is certain to depreciate in value.”

...

>“I don't think anybody sitting at this table has any idea of how to use it effectively, and therefore we don't use it,” he stated, emphasizing that “we only swing at pitches we like.”

>Buffett has also voiced concerns about future complexities, noting, “As the world gets more sophisticated, complicated and intertwined, more can go wrong.” He added that the company aims to be prepared to “act when that happens.”

More than likely we will probably see a correction at some point.; Buffett is only at what...30% cash?

You're currently doing a leveraged Buffett play lol....; You must be either 80 year old or Swiss.; To be clear, Buffett - and BRK - did not “cash out.”   They trimmed some of their largest holdings.  The bots love a good headline like “Buffett sells AAPL at the top” but dig deeper - they still own 5% of the company.  And still own millions of shares in dozens of other public companies; Is Buffet even still trustable? He’s 94. The only other people his age that are still working are politicians and they’re all a senile joke so why are we still listening to Warren?; Uber losing market share to waymo

https://x.com/aleximm/status/1867257473671082356?t=OdywiSdl9Ik95NKxro47zg&s=19; These things are more like a media stunt. Govs pretending to regulate.; they made it to 1 trillion. Pretty big day for AVGO. How many total companies are in the 1 trillion club?

AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOG, AMZN, META...

is TSM at a trillion now? I suppose crazy ass TSLA is 1 trillion, that's nuts, lol; Buy the dip; AVGO up, rest down; No meaningful revenue growth from AI investment by any company.; Rotation.. i.e. finally, people are starting to look at PE; It's kind of a few things from what I gather. Semi's are really broad, so if you are asking about the whole sector, a lot of has been in bear markets for a while now. 

Companies that deal with auto and industrial chips have seen a slowdown, probably due to a super cycle and order pull through during the pandemic. These markets where expected to rebound this year, but they still haven't. 

The only thing that has seen some solid growth is really just the AI chips, which a lot of those companies have already seen a ton of gains. 

Something like NVDA is up now 176% for the year. So there is probably also some profit taking right now. 

Then there is some fear still probably of the China exports, which a lot of companies due business in China.; Currency exchange risk. Any company doing more than 50% of its business outside the US is in the dog house and will be for a while longer. Everything about the coming administration will lead to an overly strong dollar.  (Worth looking for comments from Match CEO from this past week - they’re only about 40% non-US but were clear that the exchange is gonna kill em next quarter); Same, meli is doing nicely albeit a bit stagnant at current price. I just bought into STNe and sold some CSPs on it at $9 since it's around the 52 week low. Business seems to be executing fine and mostly the risk in Brazil seems to be the big concern from what I can find. Iirc they had a bad EPS at one point but it's back up and they even did some buybacks.; Volume is extremely low.; MACD just hit a bullish cross over and the flow is mostly all positive. Call support at $170-$171, just broke out of the weekly..looks like it may just keep going. Now that I am saying all of this I may jump in for a swing trade. Risk/reward seems decent; Higher; Avgo and walmex keeping me green somehow; Doing ok with Teredyne.  Otherwise, yes, all took a big poo poo.; S&P down 0.12%?; I try to avoid my bear impulse because at best it's only right short term and at worst it pulls me off my positions and costs me money- but when semiconductors struggle, big tech and the S&P almost always follow suit on a delay. Semi equipment is the canary for chips generally and they've been pulling back pretty hard, so I'd expect the S&P and Nasdaq to get rangebound at least. We're seeing lots of companies pulling back on capex as well, including most of big tech. So my logical brain is saying ""bear time coming"" but the market is not logical over short timeframes, it's emotional.; You've consistently gotten several of your predictions wrong. Also, as Morgan Housel says, it's easier to be a pessimist than an optimist. It makes you sound smarter, while being optimistic makes one sound like a sales man; Hopefully the mom is an AMZN shareholder.; Wait, are you that guy with Dec $200 Calls?; Market cap too small; I’ve been a longterm bagholder with a similar thesis.  It’s been frustrating at times - the macro tailwinds are huge but they’re not a great executor and I question the mgmt at times.  But I’m still in there; Mind explaining that pls? Is it related to grip upgrades?; For all the want that solar be a thing, it has been heavily impacted by rates for a few years (and we're likely not going back to ultra low rates for a very long time) and even though commercial doesn't have quite the headwinds that residential does, it (see NXT) often seems to trade with it. 

You have something like ENPH lose 75% off the high in 2022, bounce moderately and then start eroding again - lost about 33% off the peak this year going into the election then proceeded to lose about another 33% in literally about a week over policy concerns before bouncing.

It will be a thing, but without the tailwind of low rates maybe not as much of a thing as people want and it's such a ""best of times"" followed by ""holy shit worst of times"" sector because of significant impact of rates and worries over policy among other things that it feels like there's easier growth themes.

I own a little bit of solar that I bought about a month ago trying to play a bounce and am already thinking about selling. I'd like to like solar more as a long-term investment than I do.; I do worry a little that this move is coming from 2027 guidance estimates, which to me feels quite heady... Then again, if Hock's numbers are right, and he wasn't even counting Apple and OpenAI ramps in the estimates; Nike is dying in the US and Europe. I would avoid, so much competition in today's world and not currently fashionable.; I do think it's concerning, but probably winds up being nothing (or something that we never hear the actual reasoning behind.) I've added some shorts in recent days but very minor and unrelated to the drone story. 

Did buy a very small position in ONDS as a lotto ticket play that might benefit.; They say theyre seeing them over US bases in Germany now too.

I have to say I think its us.; What is it then?; Costco should give you a discount if you buy shares in bulk; Will you be buying back in at some point?; Don’t feel bad I got in at $200. The worst performer in my portfolio; I wouldn't say a big mistake yet. It's only down $5 from that.; trash; Advanced Money Destroyers; Which ones you looking at?; It’s also heavily influenced by UNH, its largest holding.; I’m an idiot- what’s ym; Generally I don't like investing in middlemen that don't provide justifiable value to either side of a transaction (patients and health systems). Eventually that arrangement erodes. Either by alternatives gaining favor or the government regulating it.; I can’t divorce a healthcare investment from politics, they are too entwined; I bought UNH shares; NVDA isn't going down to 80; All my life up to that point.; That's nice, honey. 

Completely healthy for one human being to have a net worth of $178B.; Wow you know more than Bloomberg.; I thought he didn't end up getting margin called and still has the shares he used as leverage. Also Spacex has been doing private share offerings with a presumed marketcap of something like $350 billion which may be part of why they're saying he's at 400B along with TSLA holdings.; value investors have been just destroyed. value investing is dead. its been 16+ years where value investing has been dead.

I think a new paradigm is upon us.

investing now is about instituations making money as fast as possible from momentum trades vs actual fundementals; Amd has indeed been very disappointing.  How did they let avgo eat their lunch? Why can't amd work with Amazon to design chips?; SEC fraud charges..  all publicity is good publicity!; Guessing it is a combination of:

- Different weights into Canada, developed, emerging, frontier. (I am pretty sure MSCI All Country does not invest in frontier at all). VXUS, for example, is only 7.5% Canada, so if I'm 30% in VXUS (like the global stock market is), I'm only 2.3% allocated to Canada. 
- Currency effects with the Canadian dollar versus USD/Euro/Pound/Yen.
- Possibly different dividend treatment
- Weighting of small/mid caps within all of these regions

My international exposure is basically just VXUS + AVDV (ex-US developed small cap value).

Also, I think you realize this, but the above charts are about valuation, not the actual price performance. It is showing that the discount on the P/E multiple on ex-US stocks relative to US stocks is 2 standard deviations below its historical norm. This could therefore be caused both by earnings / price.; Tons for sure;  

Im watching it nothing more  There are early signs of bottoming and a possible upswing or continuation happening.; My biggest losses and wins definitely come from similiar setups. It has worked for me in the past, usually buying into massive fear sell offs is a decent idea unless the bad news just keeps rolling in...; The cutting cycle on interest rates will be shortened if inflation remains sticky. Gold tracks the depreciation of currency but tighter lending standards reinforce a bullish dollar.; Unknown, it's simply returned to where it was three days ago.; MACD shows it ended the session bearish; People did not learn anything from three years ago.; Against my better judgement I have bought more today. There were buy out rumors in March. It’s clear Callaway acquiring TopGolf was a mistake, but maybe splitting can benefit both. I’m probably making a mistake lol; Why thank you; I mean, when he published that article, the S&P had fallen 40%. CAPE stood at 15. Today, we are in a relentless bull market that has spanned a decade and a half. Valuations are basically the highest in history. In terms of valuation, the dot com bubble is the only possible comparison. Slightly different context, don’t you think?; I’m not going cash just because of WB - it’s due to FOMO that reminds me a lot of the peak in 2021. Cryptos like “FARTCOIN” are pumping (it’s an actual coin), meme stocks are pumping, any bearish opinion is frantically downvoted probably by people who just bought the top in some tech companies with absurd 70x p/s ratios, etc.

The fact I had to explain to several redditors on this sub that ETFs and individual stocks are not the same thing leads me to believe that “dumb money” has entered the market which is usually when larger, smarter money pulls the rug.; Uber's earnings per share and free cash flow are growing rapidly, very quickly. Will this pose a threat soon?; Yep, nice to have it no longer looming for sure though. Sentiment is already terrible; I did lol; I genuinely cant tell if you are referring to the AI semi names or the beaten up equipment, auto, power names.; Same thing must have happened to PAGS that stock is also down heavily this year. It getting to point I wonder if MELI/NU or someone else acquires them.; There are a lot of growth/spec stocks down 4-7% right now.; That capex has not led to any meaningful revenue growth, so it's understandable.; Lol she is ;); No I have 1/10/25 $185 calls. I'm safe for now but theta is going to start hitting and reducing any extrinsic value. I had a target of $200 to sell before Christmas.; Thanks.; Yeah I’ve looked at them in the past. Should probably look deeper into management and the financials; Not OP but my two cents as a shareholder:  not just total grid upgrades but also on a house-by-house level. I have a small home in Northern California where, when the wind blows, our utility shuts off power to literally thousands of homes. Incredibly frustrating and then I got a backup system with a small solar array AND gas-powered generator, anything and everything I need to ride out a 72-hour period.  I don’t have any medical needs where power is life-or-death but i wonder about those who do and how they make it - probly upgraded before me; For me it’s related to people needing power when natural disasters take down power for days on end; Enph has had that happen but they also had cratered revenues to go along with it. FSLR has lost 33% while continuing to grow and make profits. Also ENPH is still trading at a ridiculous multiple even after crashing. 

I’m not super convinced by the interest rate argument, every industry has to eat those rates. Also they’ve been up for a while now and the slowdown that you would expect to come with it has already happened. Definitely a longer term play with possible near term upside as well; They're us military drones being tested; Subscription business with 93% renewal rate and 94% employee retention.

The products at Costco are all cost-plus.; Does AMC still give out free popcorn?; Depends on the price point. If it retraces below the 200-day EMA all the way back to $10-15, then yes. It would be criminally undervalued considering the YoY improvements. The macro tailwinds that powered its initial rise haven't disappeared either.; STNE and DKNG are a couple. Want to see them go lower though. STNE would just be a 1% of portfolio YOLO to see what happens over the next 1-2 years.; Dow Jones futures.; Fair comment; You don't know how healthcare works.; RemindMe! 1 year; lmao; [removed]; not likely, they probably just want to maximize clicks; he sold a metric ton of shares in 2022 to fund the purchase of Twitter... just straight up sold hundred million+ shares on the open market; I don't think value investing is dead or ever will be, but I think the short term meme and hype rallies are something that isn't going away anytime soon. Most of these names are fairly small fish and rally hard and then fall hard. There will be times when these kind of stocks are dead again and times when they rally harder than they are now. I think a lot of people are reading too much into them. Better to just make a decision whether play that game or stay out of that side of the market, no need to have a tantrum over it.; Can you define what you mean by “value investing” and why you think its dead?; “New paradigm” okay, this is the top. Everytime that someone says it, be it 1999 or 2021 we crash hard; Thanks for the response. You make some good points. I just find it weird that everyone seems to be complaining so much about their VXUS, and while my global allocation is very much under-performing US, it's still performing better than expectations. But like you said, there are a lot of factors, and we're not comparing 1 to 1.; I just think that sometimes speculating gets a bad wrap. If you are young and you are being responsible with your money, like in this case playing with just money you made, I don't see anything wrong with. 

To add to it, everyone has different approaches and being constant with your approach I do think helps over time. I've come to learn that you won't always be right, but as long as your more right than wrong, your gains should outweigh those losses.; Maybe when I'm an old fogey I'll grow to hate downturns instead of seeing them as opportunities.; You may be right that someone may acquire one piece or the other where they’d never want the combined entity.; I saw someone (on the BBAI or Penny subs) ask what price to earnings meant. I know there are TSLA buyers that don't know the practical difference and meaning of what Ford earns per share and what TSLA makes per share and what that means relative to their current price.


I've seen people again start talking about BTC as a ""business"" entity. Doge popped again. I've seen multiple people that don't know the stock they are buying and pumping is actively selling shares openly. People are reposting fabricated ""leaked"" earnings to pump stocks. 


I've seen people honest to God pump with all sincerity absolute garbage companies and when you push them they will admit they are ""just looking for a short term pop"". It's all one big  rug pull. 


I'm mostly cash and scaling into an inverse ETF.; Makes total sense and I never try to critique people around what they want to do. To me, at the end of the day, it's your money. Make your own decisions. 

I just think sometimes people will just follow what Buffet does, but not listen to what Buffet says lol. 

Like buffet is a big time just buy a low cost index. Basically a VTI and chill bro. 

I personally don't do ""cash"" positions, but I have liquidity to move over to take advantage of any opportunities. I screen to find things to invest in and for the past like 3 months or longer, there really isn't anything even interesting to buy right now. 

The only moves I made was buying some semi equipment names because they have moved into great value territory for a long term position, but I'm buying knowing that the short to mid term is probably going to be really rocky.; Not soon but market sees it coming and that'll bottle up the share price if they think disruption is on the horizon.; Both. Within semi space, TSM, ASML are getting the attention, finally. Personally, I'm sick or hearing about NVDA all the time. ""Demand is insane"" but so are the valuations.; Would prob come at a nice premium since they're profitable and growing profits still, just slower growth. 

Anyway if you're interested in STNE I got like 3% for selling CSPs one week out and plan to wheel those or keep selling more until they executed. $9 stroke for 12/20, .30 to sit on the money a week; They will correct further.; NVDA and to a lesser extent AVGO and MRVL are the big winners of the AI gold rush-not software like big tech yet. We're at the point in the dotcom-like cycle where companies like Cisco were shooting up due to hardware sales but microsoft was still poking around looking for ways to grow revenue in software. I also think AMD will get in on things after people are through tax loss harvesting them.

I'm looking for acquisition targets rather than buying big tech here, as I think M&A will be hot the next 4 years. The FTC has caused a backlog in what bigtech has been wanting to snap up and when given the chance by the new admin's laissez faire approach they're going to consolidate for marketpower where they can.; Sell Sell.. ; Hopefully RCAT product!; Groceries as a service; Can I politely ask, what % of revenue is subscription?; It's an interesting take on it at least.; So subscriptions are worth a 60x multiple??

How’s that make sense; Seems like a pretty good recovery today since the morning? I'm still holding but might exit soon as well; Would you care to explain?; I will be messaging you in 1 year on [**2025-12-13 20:36:42 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2025-12-13%2020:36:42%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hd9ewq/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_dec/m1wykhw/?context=3)

Sorry my opinion upsets you bro; Trolling, insults, or harassment, especially in posts requesting advice, is not tolerated.  Please try to keep discussions on /r/stocks civil by providing straightforward responses without including any insults or harassment.

Continual abuse of /r/stocks rule #5 regarding trolling, insulting and harassment will result in your account being banned.

A full explanation of all /r/stocks rules can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/rules

Keep the political stuff off the sub; Love that last paragraph, very true for me over last 5 years. I have scores of losers, but mostly small and contained losses with say 15 really great winners I let run hard and long; Agreed. I like AMAT and KLAC but both have ugly charts but excellent long term setups.; I am in TSM and 4 of the fab 5. TSM has been good, the rest not so much. I am not trying to be edgy by leaving out the NVDA, MRVL, AVGO but just genuinely more interested in equipment makers.; They sell Gas and GaaS; Looks like 1.8% at a glance; I don’t think % of revenue is a very good lens to view that from since it’s probably 98c of profit for every dollar brought in; It has made sense for Netflix shareholders.  And Amazon Prime.  And 135x has made sense for Spotify shareholders.  

I’ll redirect you to my original point which is that actually knowing what a business is and does should be the first key to understanding it.; It's recovered back to the 100-day EMA. Probably should watch volume though: the deciding factor for me to exit my position is the rising selling pressure over the past week. For the last month volume has been slightly bearish, but it's turned up viciously in the last 3 sessions.; They're corporations like anything other. If you don't like that, fine, and i agree, but that's the system. That shouldn't guide investment decisions. I buy coca cola stock, but i tell people not to drink their products (I'm in healthcare). In fact i even tell people that their soda consumption is literally putting money into my checking account. Also, an insurance company denying claims can have beneficial effects too, like countering price gouging by pharmaceutical companies.  They don't deny claims for simple, cheap, lifesaving interventions like basic antibiotics, etc. Most denials are for complex or expensive procedures, tests, and drugs that really aren't necessary, but would be lucrative businesses if insurance were to cover them.; Idk what you said but I'm not easily offended, couldn't even read it lol; I wrote a like post, not a daily thing, on the sub about a year ago about the lessons I've learned over the years being a more active investor. 

That's a big one for me. Just realizing you won't always be right. Just need to be more right than wrong lol. 

>**Lesson 4: Be patient and you still can be wrong**

>If you done your due dillegence when investing, it at least gives you confidence around your investment. You can be right, but have the timing wrong. The market can also disagree with you at any point. At least being confident in your investments will help in any down turns. Especially if the company is growing revenues and expanding margins.

>Biggest thing is that even after all this, you can still get it wrong. The goal for me is have my winners outperform my losers. Realizing that you will still pick some losers is ok, but at least you have followed a process that should have an end result with more winning picks than losing picks.; This is really not that bad of a pick. I think investors are scared about the capex needed but at least they are offering a real life saving service and is massively difficult to build from the ground up. The moat is large and unlikely other players will enter this space.; 100% 

I mean these companies are cyclical anyways, so buying into weakness tends to be the move. That's the thing I try to express to anyone here that are looking into them, that these need to be viewed as long term, since auto and industrial markets in the semi space have not bottomed and there was a super cycle over the last few years. 

However, long term wise, you will probably be happy buying these names now.; I believe it's a huge percentage of their profit though. I don't have the number off hand.; If you look at those companies they are still growing top line double+ that of COST and their profit margins are up similarly or more as well. 

PLUS they are STILL trading at lower multiples.; Thanks for the information. I just sold it. I'll continue to watch it for an opportunity to re-enter. It offsets my loss from TMDX which I just realized, so it works out.; I don’t see what that has to do with my comment or why you think I don’t know how healthcare works. Every corporation performance is tied to policy. Tariffs, subsidies, taxes, regulations… all impact company performance; I agree about capex, and also TAM concerns... If growth comes back strong next Q narrative will flip again I think; Both are majorly shareholder friendly as well. Sadly, in a correction these will get hit too despite already being well off their highs for the year.; Not correct.  But you’re also now teleporting the goalposts to suddenly care about other metrics.  Your original beef was literally “How’s it make sense” for subscription companies to have a 60x multiple.  I showed how it made incredible sense and gains for investors to own 60x or even 135x subscription names.

I don’t own COST or care if anyone does or doesn’t.  I’m just correcting the misinformation.; Right, I forget my second reason: when it dropped below its accumulation line on Thursday, investors didn't choose to buy more below fair value. Instead, they sold off hard - that portends a slow decline in the next few weeks and months.; [removed]"

121,AAPL The Buyback machine,"[AAPL Shares Outstanding 2015-2024](https://preview.redd.it/x8mz301v4j6e1.png?width=2379&format=png&auto=webp&s=5465bd515fa9d34f24efc5049a92eee43db7e71c)

[AAPL EPS 2015-2024](https://preview.redd.it/zqnduwj26j6e1.png?width=2380&format=png&auto=webp&s=f29e81e783d13afdf411c3b4a6876520f4c22193)

I kinda got this idea in my head that AAPL is a company without much growth left and have been thinking about lightening up my position on it.

So I decided to make some graphs to figure out what to think and because pictures easy raw data hard. 

First off I was curious what apple's shares outstanding looked like. I know their buy back program is massive and I also know they're not growing top line revenue but are spending a ton on buybacks so this was a good place to start. Considering the share price has also been going up a lot and their market cap is massive so I thought buybacks might have a negligible effect. Wow was I wrong. The shares outstanding are down like 36% in ten years! I couldn't ask for a better looking chart. At this rate it'll all be bought back in like 18.9 more years.

Then I was obviously curious about the EPS and decided to graph that. I was less surprised about how this turned out but it did still offer some insights. I hadn't seen before that they had multiple recent periods of EPS decline that they managed to turn around in big ways. And their EPS since covid is surprisingly down less than I thought so that's not so bad.

It doesn't change my opinion that their product lines are basically stagnant and not exactly innovative on a level that would spur a ton of growth, who tf needs another slimmer iPhone, iPad etc and I think that's a pretty widely held belief given the charts.

However, it's pretty crazy to see that they've bought back a 3rd of their shares in the past 9 years. Also pretty wild to see how its EPS has grown despite not a lot of innovation.

Lastly I was curious how their wearables revenue was doing because I heard recently about the FDA approving AirPods to be hearing devices which is probably a huge market? IDK but what I do know is hearing aids are stupid expensive compared to $200 air pods so this could be big. So far it looks like wearables is doing about $9B a quarter so if growth in that picked up it could be meaningful

All in all I think I keep my position the same, especially considering most of it is through SPYG which has AAPL and NVDA nearly the same weights which kinda strikes me as a yin and yang sorta situation.

Position: long \~$21,000 in shares",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hd3xw8/aapl_the_buyback_machine/,108,2024-12-13 05:05:07,"Been holding apple since 08. I might skim some profit here and there but I don't over analyze companies like Apple. They are a company that makes its investors money over and over and over. ; APPL is a ""stay rich"" equity, the shares won't tank over long period. 

This company can acquire innovation by buying the companies off. So doesn't matter if said company is stagnant, it has enough war chest to last a long long time (long means next 40 years or thereabouts).; I have a firm belief that apples next move is wearable health care. They are consolidating so much health care data on the masses with the Apple Watch to completely change healthcare. 

I think people are missing this. Long holder here.; I've held APPL since 2006.  Buy and never sell, honestly.; I love this:

>It doesn't change my opinion that their product lines are basically stagnant and not exactly innovative 

So how do you frame the watch and airpods who were introduced as products in 2015 and 2016 respectively and now totally dominate their respective markets? 

Another way to look at it is to think about other companies trying to compete with Apple on wearables. There are effectively none that can wield Apple's combination of the ecosystem and logistics. Anyone inventing anything useful will have to face that juggernaut if Apple chooses to make a version of it.; Well obviously their earnings per share will grow if they're buying back shares. With less shares you lower the denominator while flat earnings, the nominator, can remain flat and still grow the bottom line. So.. imagine rather than dividing 1/3, you're now dividing 1/2. I'm not sure why this is a revelation in your post?; In theory I will be the only shareholder in 18.9 years. I never knew the path to trillionaire was so easy.; Buybacks directly increase earnings per share; No growth 30+ pe lol

Must be too much money floating around still; Love how AAPL keeps buying back its own shares! 🍏💰; Overall Apple just needs to keep up with the buybacks while improving their margins with their service revenue. If they keep doing that they will be fine.; [deleted]; Stupid general question: How is it determined which shares are bought back when buybacks occur?  And how does it impact someone who may only hold a stock indirectly, like through an ETF?; I have been slowing selling as price marches higher in my Roth. I will continue to do so. It’s a company with owning but there are better names out there with more compelling risk/reward.; Apple is a Cha-Ching, cha-ching machine !!!; When a company pays dividends and buys back stock, it hasn’t got anything left in it.

Apple has become the Coca-Cola of tech. Their products stagnate and their development is minuscule, incremental and will be overtaken.

The most obvious indicator to me is how iOS has lost its cutting edge to Android. Only the security perspective remains and Google really started doing something about it this year: https://security.googleblog.com/2024/05/io-2024-whats-new-in-android-security.html

Apple is still very good at designing hardware. Especially expensive, good looking hardware. However the software side is lagging behind competitors.; How is it that you think you’re supposed to have an idea how the growth and prospectus of one of the largest companies in the world is supposed to go? Stop tying to outsmart the markets. ; When’s the last time you added ?  I haven’t bought in over a year aside from dividends; And over and over and over .... Plant that apple tree don't ever cut it down. Just take a look outside sometimes see how it's grown. Enjoy the ones that fell off the tree(dividends) 
Sorry for the dumb metaphor but it's waaaaay past my bedtime lol.

P.s 
When I do agree with a chunk of the assessment I think the near cult following apple has in its base consumers. Is being undervalued. They bitch a moan about what ever they don't like on there current iPhone and yet...It's not even a thought to them, they need new phone,watch, computer,etc... they had right for apple.; When Buffett sold like half his stake, it was the first time I ever really wondered about his age.; look at it in the AI race, not quite at the top

there have been apple like companies before, like GE in the 70s, IBM in the 2000s, nobody could imagine a world without them, but times do change and it might be that other industries / companies just outgrow todays champions.

if you do understand the business, the moat, leadership etc do pick stocks.

 Just bear in mind the closer you get to the 10y mark, you hit Buffets wager of not beating 'the market'. Are you in the 10th percentile and can you stand there in the next 10 or more years ?; I agree, seems like big growth to be had undercutting the current overpriced and shitty health devices; I mean you'll have to sell one day, why buy when you'll never sell; They did innovate with the Vision Pro as well. Even though it wasn't as popular as expected, they're going in the right direction. 

I hope they don't give up on it and instead, try to make a cheaper version of glasses.; Plus the m1 MacBooks in 2020 brought an insane boost in performance compared to the intel chips. 
 
Their year to year upgrades aren’t always going to be worthwhile, but to say they aren’t innovating is absurd.; Also their products have a finite life expectancy.  The constant security and tech innovation of online existence forces their products to become paperweights in 5-7 years.  In which case the user usually says “hey it works but it aged out, I’ll give up my IPhone 6 for the 16”.; ... *fewer* shares; You can’t possibly be the only shareholder when I’ll be right there with you. I hope not to touch my shares for the next 20 years.; honestly fair enough, a 30 PE with mostly flat EPS growth is kinda scary. EPS is up like 100% in 5 years but it all happened in 2021; That would cause mass exodus of employees, either by finding another employer or retiring.; They buy shares on the open market just like you and me; who's overtaken Coke in that world?; I've kept it steady since 2019. 450 shares the dividend isn't great but covers a few date nights a year or the occasional stripper 😂; No company in history had their moats. Every single teen wants an iPhone, that means apple services, applecare, wearables, macbooks and iPad. All locked in.

Once theyre a little bit older , siri speakers, homekit everything. 

Locked in for life. Im looking for better returns right now but I would wager apple growing nice and steady every year for 20 years plus.

If my bets materialize you can bet im jumping back for 
Apple safety shortly.; That’s how the billionaires transfer their wealth tax free.. 

They buy, then never sell, and when they die the shares transfer with cost basis. They take loans against their portfolios for living expenses; Retire and sell little by little; could sell CCs on it when you're ready to generate some income off the shares but not sell them outright; borrow from myself with interest-only loans from my portfolio and allow my stocks to continue growing.; AAPL Vision Pro is a $5K trinket targeting the wrong demographic with the wrong price tag; Vision pro innovate? Lol; I’m fine splitting the $20 trillion with you.; Huh, for some reason I assumed it was some sort of special action separate from market purchases.; *will is the keyword.; I swear I go to nightclubs because of the stripper index! Just trying to get a feel of the economy.; I have been buying in a “double” dividend for many years and it makes pretty green numbers on a screen. Those “small” dividends in 2013 are not small now.; Include their revolutionary apple silicon in their hardware like laptops etc that everyone is trying to catch up with ARM architecture. Apple will keep on living for a long time.; i agree with you that it's a good business today, exactly for the reasons you mention. though some investors would complain their growth completely stopped.

but for the next 20 years.. i am not so sure. 20y ago apple did not have the iphone at all, amazon was just a online bookstore, netflix was a video renting store. could anyone have guessed how they would evolve 20y later ? not me at least; Very Americanistic view, and utterly wrong. Apple isn't hip with the kids anymore, it's your technofobic old mom or grandma's phone. Sibce elder use it kids and youths want to avoid it.



Also they're so far behind in AI and features it feels you're using yesteryears tech. All at a price point where you got to pay a lot for a former great brand, all while inflation went haywire. Nah, Apple got 50% of USA by the balls but the rest of the work isn't smoking it. Certainly not the echo system, don't know any iPhone user that owns a mac/pad...; How do they pay interest on the loan? Other income?; Sadly agreed. 

But, they can update it and improve on it for the right demographic at the right price tag.; Did you try it? It is insane.; There is enough volume for them to just buy shares that are being sold anyway.; I quit smoking about 20 years ago when my pack of Marlboro Reds were around $3.60/pack.

From time to time I'll ask how much they are now when I stop into a place that sells them. Current price: more than $10/pack now.; Stock picking is a game of educated guessing. I just see whats around me when I travel and almost everyone who ‘made it’ seems to be stuck in that ecosystem. 

So you know my guess; You dont know a single person with both an iphone and an ipad/macbook?

You must not know many people.; Your right even if the Americans can't understand how much more popular Android is everywhere else.; yes, of course i tried it.; Same"
122,Duplicated ACAT transfer question.,"Hey guys, 

I initiated an ACAT transfer to brokerage A and it failed a few times due to random errors like unsettled funds so I told my brokerage to cancel any attempts to transfer to brokerage A.  I also told brokerage A to not initiate any more requests on my behalf.  Both my bank and brokerage A agreed and all was settled.

I think submit an ACAT to brokerage B and everything goes off without a hitch.  The shares arrive in brokerage B at the scheduled time, but then I receive an email from brokerage B stating that my transfer is complete as well.  I now have duplicate shares in two different brokerages.

I called all 3 banks and they said that everything looks good and is finalized on their end.  I told them about the duplicate funds and my bank only sees the transfer to brokerage A (which I cancelled) and nothing to brokerage B.  We together opened a ticket with APEX clearing house and got them on the phone.  They too stated that everything looked great from their end and they can see nothing wrong.  

Now I am sitting here with shares I did not purchase.  What do I do now to remedy this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hd25kt/duplicated_acat_transfer_question/,2,2024-12-13 03:28:34,

yeah last 5 is UNDERVALUED ! LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); What a regard 8 yo me was, coulda been a billionaire by now.; No way does the entire wealth of the nation being tied to seven tickers end poorly for any of us.

🤡; Now do it for the biggest 7 in 2010.; Lmao these gains are actually insane. Tesla's [revenue jumped to $96.77B](https://beyondspx.com/article/tesla-inc-tsla-driving-the-future-of-sustainable-transportation) in 2023 but Elon just hit [$400B net worth](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musks-net-worth-tops-143636735.html) today. Dude's literally swimming in tendies while we're all here eating ramen. 

NVDA though... that's the real money printer. Those sweet sweet AI gains got everyone drooling. Their revenue straight up [exploded 122% YoY](https://beyondspx.com/article/nvidia-the-ai-powerhouse-dominating-the-semiconductor-landscape) last quarter. Jensen's cooking up something special in that kitchen wearing his leather jacket.

Meanwhile boomers are celebrating their 15% S&P gains like it's something special. Sir this is a casino.; Dumbest chart I’ve seen in a long time and that’s saying something. Why would you show the return starting with TSLA ipo date? You’re missing the massive growth that already occurred for the other companies following ipo.

This reminds me on one of those misleading pay gap charts people post on LinkedIn - hoping that stops eventually; MANGA: Meta Apple Nvdia Google Amazon. Manga is tagalog for mengoes; Why is meta since it’s 2012 IPO lol

Edit： nvm im regarded; Is there an ETF for just the mag 7?; ETF cucks in shambles; Why doesn’t everybody just buy $MAGS ? Feels like a no brainer; Gotta love our dystopian future with big tech ruling the world ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); I am waiting for the day Tsla crash back :D this is not the first time guys.; Where is bitcoin; So don’t buy ETFs?; which will be the new magnificent 7  in 2040 ?

Looks like a glorified chat bot; MAGS; SPY; Qqq; Why is a car company with all those tech companies ; Incase you’re being serious because I’m sure some other people actually are wondering. 

They’re MAG7 BECAUSE of their returns rather than their returns being because they’re MAG7.; Because u can just buy the mag7 stocks on your own without paying management fees to the ETF manager…

How hard can it be to buy 7 stocks?

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); It rebalances quarterly with an equal weight exposure. In the graph we see the majority of the gain came from two tickers.

If one ticker rises significantly, they will sell that and rebalance. This is good in a risk management way but its also cutting its winners.; That's exactly what I did. Don't tell the gards's our secret.; narrator: and it keeps on happening; 1900:

Etc; Highly doubt that. Capitalism is naturally moving towards monopoly without government intervention, and so is technological advancement. The biggest companies will naturally make up a larger portion of the economy over time.

US government doesn’t mind though. Global monopoly of US businesses outweigh the drawbacks brought to the local economy.; Or when Dump gets into office. He tanks anything he touches. He did it once and left unscathed( not really). He lost daddy’s money and MeeMaw the Intel Baller is rolling in her grave!; Bruh you're missing the entire point. NVDA isn't making money from chatbots - they're selling the [hardware that powers literally every major AI model](https://beyondspx.com/article/nvidia-the-ai-powerhouse-dominating-the-semiconductor-landscape) out there. Their GPUs are the backbone of every data center running AI workloads. That's why their revenue jumped 122% YoY.

Look at all these [modular data centers being built](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mizuho-modular-data-centers-power-171105497.html) just to handle AI computing. Every single one needs NVDA chips. Microsoft, Google, Meta - they're all Jensen's customers now.

This isn't some startup burning cash on a chatbot. This is industrial-grade computing infrastructure that companies are fighting to get their hands on. The AI hype might be real but NVDA's profits are even more real.; it would first be important to distinguish between ""AI"" and LLM's. LLM have efficiency benefits for sure. I know people including myself in a variety of professions that use them. They can probably replace 10% - 15% of the office workforce no problem. 

AI is used in an incredible amount of fields right now and doing amazing things.; Think about like this, you can either replace or enhance the productivity of your white collar workforce. That’s immediate money right there just from organizational efficiency.; Are you mag7 because your returns are the highest? Or are your returns the highest because you are mag7?; He's serious and so am I, bought these 5-10 years ago, every year they were ""too high""; The U.S. government has always been in favor of monopolies, especially those that are favored by government. That's how the economy was built. It was built off the profits made by select few men who had political ties that the government favored. 

This is just the modern tech version. I mean there is a common philosophical take that we are not living in capitalism, but in technofeudalism.

I've said for years it's a corptocracy, but it certainly is more tech driven than my take on it was.; And where does the AI make money for these companies? What happens if these companies figure out they are losing money and stop buying the chips? Or if they copy them and make their own?; Wouldn’t it be a technoligarchy; It's going to take a while for people to realize these gpts don't really do much work.; I work at a large international bank and we already replaced hundreds of people with AI...

You guys have no idea how low level office and even it work can be  replaced with AI already.; AI is definitely going to replace outsourcing menial tasks to Indian contracting companies like Cognizant, which is what most large companies are doing on the back end for sorting through emails, handling simple requests, etc. 

You might not ever even deal with one of these workers as a customer but they do a ton of grunt work. Most of this stuff is super easy, it’s stuff that needs a human to read and process (email requests etc) but 90% of them are black and white simple stuff. Think changing a mailing address on file, updating contact info, adding a vehicle to an auto insurance policy, things like that. Anything more complex gets kicked onshore to the actual customer service team.

At least at my company (large Fortune 500 insurance company - not health insurance) we contract with Cognizant and have been trying to get rid of them for years due to the cost of their contract and the frequent QA errors. This is one of many, many jobs that AI could easily replace with higher average quality and lower costs. 

It’s going to be huge.; Most of the tools needed to create futuristic job stealing robots are there. We currently have Ai that can talk to you in a video chat responding to what it sees on camera, Ai that can created plans for tasks, and neural nets/Nvidia software that can pilot robot bodies. 

The main issue is finalizing the robot bodies, fine tuning the Ai/controls, mass production, etc. All things that’ll happen with some struggling and effort in the next 1-3 years.; You're completely missing how the AI industry actually works. These companies aren't ""losing money"" on AI - they're rushing to build massive infrastructure because AI is transforming their entire business models. Look at [Meta and Microsoft's soaring profits](https://finance.yahoo.com/m/151e1d00-6dbe-3a50-9943-588cd97b8c0d/can-palantir-stock-become-the.html) from AI deployment.

Making their own chips? That's not happening anytime soon. NVIDIA's tech lead is massive - they've spent decades perfecting their GPU architecture and CUDA ecosystem. The [revenue numbers don't lie](https://beyondspx.com/article/nvidia-the-ai-powerhouse-dominating-the-semiconductor-landscape) - $60.92B annual revenue with $29.76B net income. They're absolutely crushing it.

You think companies spending billions on AI infrastructure are just gonna suddenly stop? The [AI chip market is growing 38% annually](https://finance.yahoo.com/m/45543e0d-b676-36ac-97cd-159c873dd859/prediction%3A-amd-stock-will.html). This isn't some temporary trend - it's a fundamental shift in computing. NVDA isn't selling picks and shovels during a gold rush, they're selling the entire mining operation.; It won’t be as big as you think. Also it will take years to implement if not decades. As this happens they don’t have unlimited money. This stinks of dotcom bubble tbh; Replacing some outsourcing to India for low-skill jobs is not a disruptive technology. I get that it may be impactful for your company, but it's just not that big a deal. The ""big deal"" or ""disruptive"" technologies are ones like the internet, or cars. This doesn't look like ""company XYZ is able to cut ABC department""; it looks like ""company XYZ and its 10 competitors are all gone in 5 years and replaced by two radical new companies that make 10x more than those previous companies put together.""

A perfect example of this right now is robo taxies. They exist, and no one cares. And why should they care? Why did \*anyone\* ever care about self-driving? We can all already drive or take buses. Self-driving is a convenience, it's filed under ""great to have"" but it isn't disruptive. It isn't faster. It isn't cheaper. Let alone much faster or much cheaper. LLMs fall into this category, and they still haven't even paid the piper on training and inference costs.; Replacing menial tasks is really not a big cost improvement since contract low quality outsourced work is… low cost.; I think you don't realize how clueless most people are...

Low skilled white collar workers and creative people will have their jobs change heavily in the coming 10y.; I think we're in agreement that it's going to be a big industry and that it will continue to see growth. All I'm saying is that everyone is treating it like a disruptive technology, and it's not. It's just a new tool. To draw an analogy, so-called AI is more like Excel than personal computing in general. But everyone wants to believe it's the latter so that they can make a giant pile of money."
124,Apple’s New Moves and Updates On $490M Investor Settlement,"Hey everyone, if you missed it, they seem to be diving into something straight out of a Steve Jobs dream—developing smart home devices (like a TV or similar) powered by its new Apple Intelligence. It’s still early days, but this could be a real development next year.



About the settlement over Tim Cook’s 2018 comments on China’s sales— you might already know about it, but there’s been an update, so here’s a quick recap for anyone who missed it. 

  


Back in 2018, Cook mentioned during an earnings call that while Apple faced sales issues in countries with high inflation (like Brazil and Russia), there were “no issues in China.” But just days later, Apple cut production orders from suppliers, so I think it was obviously otherwise.



And just two months later, Apple shocked everyone with its first announcement about the revenue cut since the iPhone establishment in 2007, causing AAPL to drop by 10% and resulting in 70B losses.



This led to multiple lawsuits accusing Apple of misleading investors. While Apple has consistently denied any wrongdoing, the company recently agreed to a $490M settlement, even before a court hearing.



But here’s the update, I just found out that even though the deadline already passed, they are taking late claims on this. So if you were hit by this, you can check it out and [file for it](https://11thestate.com/cases/apple-investor-settlement).

  


However, do you think it’s a good idea to start developing new products like this? And does that half a billion even come close to covering the $70 billion loss?

125,Missed NVIDIA Surge? Three AI potential stocks are waiting for your chance!,"This year, stocks of the “Big 7,” including Amazon, Meta Platforms, Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft, Nvidia, and Apple, have soared, including a nearly 3% gain on Wednesday. Tech ETFs have hit 29 new highs this year.



Oracle: strong growth, attractive valuation



Oracle shares fell 6% to $178 after reporting fiscal second-quarter earnings on Monday. Nonetheless, its shares have doubled since the end of 2022. This share price decline is a natural market reaction to high expectations.



The earnings report showed good prospects for Oracle future growth. Quarterly revenue rose 8.6% year-on-year to $14.1 billion, with cloud revenue up 24% to $5.9 billion and cloud infrastructure revenue reaching a further $2.4 billion. Oracle is migrating customers from traditional data storage to its efficient AI-enabled services. Future third-quarter revenue is expected to grow 8%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate growth of up to 10%



Oracle cloud infrastructure business is growing faster than the industry average, and overall annual revenue growth is expected to remain above 10% going forward. Although AI-related investments will put pressure on margins in the short term, analysts expect its average annual earnings per share growth rate to reach 18% over the next four years. Its current price-to-earnings ratio of 27 times expected earnings over the next 12 months is significantly lower than the average for the U.S. software industry, but its growth outlook is much stronger and the stock has room for further upside



Teradyne: Robotics and Chip Testing



Shares of Teradyne, a $19 billion robotics and chip-testing equipment maker, are down about 27% from their summer high of $163.21, and currently stand at $120. A recent slowdown in capital spending by industrial customers has led to a deceleration in growth in its industrial business, but the long-term outlook remains positive



Sales in this segment are expected to recover as industrial customers resume investment in automation equipment. Meanwhile, growing demand for AI chips is driving increased demand for chip test equipment. Total revenue for the third quarter increased 5% to $737 million. The analysis predicts that the market in which Teradyne is located could reach $19 billion by the end of the century, with its industry position strong and only Tokyo-based Advantest as its main competitor



Analysts expect Teradyne revenue and earnings per share to grow to $4.1 billion and $5.99, respectively, by 2026. If the company proves to be on a good trajectory, shares are expected to rally. Its price-to-earnings ratio is currently 28 times, down from a yearly high of 37 times



AMD: The AI chip chaser



AMD shares fell 39% to $127 from a high of $227.30 in March as AI chip sales missed expectations. However, the company recently raised its full-year revenue guidance to $5 billion from $4.5 billion



AMD CEO Zifeng Su said the long-term size of the AI chip market could exceed $500 billion. NVIDIA currently occupies a $100 billion market, but customers still need to diversify their supply chains, and AMD is the second-biggest option after NVIDIA



Analysts expect AMD annual sales of data center chips, including AI chips, to grow 36% to $31 billion by 2027. A lower price-to-earnings ratio (26x vs. Nvidia 33x) also provides upside to its stock price



These three companies are uniquely positioned for long-term growth potential in the AI wave, and may be worth considering as a “second tier” for investors who missed Nvidia surge

126,How come AAPL isn’t affected by the rise of the AI market?,"One might wonder how AAPL has managed to remain largely unaffected by the rapid rise of AI technology. Unlike the competitors, Apple doesn’t seem to be actively showing as of today any developed LLM yet, just announcements. Meanwhile,  besides OpenAI, Google every other day is improvindg their Gemini, Microsoft has firmly planted its foot in the door with its heavy involvement in OpenAI. Third parties like Meta and Elon Musk have already into the LLM market as competitors. All in all, most released systems are already at the 2nd or 3rd generation, at least. Yet, nothing of the sort appears to be happening within Apple. Despite this, AAPL hasn’t suffered any major setbacks; in fact, it has been steadily growing in recent years. What’s keeping Apple from losing ground? What’s your take on this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hchkfs/how_come_aapl_isnt_affected_by_the_rise_of_the_ai/,53,2024-12-12 10:40:06,"Its the same reason BMW doesn’t own an oil refinery; I think AAPL has decoupled itself from the AI game. And it could be a smart move. AI in these relatively early stages is still an expensive game. AAPL seems content to focus on the consumer product/software aspects of their business which are cash cows, and they can monetise AI in the future by integrating other developers' apps onto their platform anyway.; Apple is up 30% this year by the way; Probably because it is just not an area that has been a strength for Apple.

I suspect what we will ultimate see is on Agent win majority of the market.  I believe that will come from Google.

The agent will ultimately be offered on Apple products with Google sharing in the huge profits generated.

It will be very, very profitable for both companies.; [deleted]; This is a strange post OP.  Simply put do you make money when you train an LLM or when you deploy an LLM.  Today the money to be made in the former is cornered by nvidia.  What about the latter -- it's strongly in the hands of those who own the hardware or the entire ecosystem. That's apple.  You can see the whispers today, a significant portion of die area going to neural processing units (intel, apple ... you name it).  Only question is where will the giant share of money be made in training or the deployment.  Your guess is probably as good as anybody else.; Does Apple announcing AI as “Apple Intelligence” and the stock price rising after they made the announcement not count?; Apple makes phones. And everyone on the planet wants one of their phones.; Apple is the Gatekeeper.

Why spend billions on development when you can spend 100s of billions on buying a company instead?; They have their own ecosystem; Because Apple is not a tech company it is a consumer luxury company.; All the big LLM offerings you mention are massively unprofitable and it's unclear when or if they will provide enough utility to users that users want to actually pay enough money to fund the cost of the queries they run plus the ongoing R&D costs of improving the models.  Apple mostly avoids that kind of game, which is why they are trying to run on-device AI models for as many use cases as they can.  The results won't be as good as the cloud based alternatives, but those alternatives operate at a net loss which Apple is not interested in.  Apple will partner with them to feed them users so they can keep burning cash attempting to monetize.  OpenAI is the first partner Apple is integrating such that users can opt in to querying ChatGPT, and there will likely be others.  Perhaps eventually those partners will be profitable, it really doesn't matter to Apple unless they start building consumer electronics.; Don’t ask questions.

Apple has been in the AI game for sometime now and IMO ahead of the curve. AI model, they might be behind.  

They got edge device AI. Watch, Phone, MacBook, etc. now they launched their own AI data center.

Look at hardware design and planning. Not coincidental. 

They are more measured in launching software solutions.; Just like blockbuster detached itself from digital media ; Unless AI makes a paradigm shift occur in the device application market… say to headsets and neural links?; Bro still hasn't found out about monthly charts; And announced Apple intelligence with OpenAI as a partner and have released many ai features over the past few months.

The local processing will at most allow for some limited machine learning more traditional function, possibly to be applied to image or sound processing, I think. So no, this is not enough of a response on the part of  Apple to the rise of larg AI systems.; Need to define if we are talking consumer or enterprise?

In the Enterprise AI is already very profitable for Google and Microsoft.     Realize they are the shovel providers and the companies using the AI might or might not be profitable but that does not change the fact it is very profitable for Google and Microsoft.   More for Google as they have the TPUs and so much fatter margins as Microsoft has to pay the huge Nvidia tax.

Take a look at GCP and Azure numbers over the last couple of quarters.   AI has enabled Google to have accelerated growth rates for GCP.  Last quarter it was 35%.

The place it is yet profitable is on the consumer side.  But that is where there will ultimately be the biggest profits.

We will all interact with an Agent at some point and this will be very, very profitable for the company that provides.

I expect Google to win this space.  They are just well positioned and had the vision to do the things needed like the TPUs.

I would then expect the Google agent to be offered on Apple products and Google sharing in the profits generated with Apple.; Latest trailing PE of 40 is due the one time EU tax penalty payment. Forward PE is around 33-34. Which is definitely high, but comparable to other mag7s.; What they have done with Apple Silicon is absolutely astounding.  They’re running rings around everyone in the SoC space.; Not a tech company? They supply the planet with tech devices lol; Worry not. It's just a matter of time when Apple comes up with touchscreen subscriptions or some shit like that.; Nvidia GPU + CUDA gave them a massive headstart.; Juries out on GenAI But the need for high performance computing is inescapable and NVDA are all over that. ; Quite typical of Apple to sit back while the entire market rushes into a new sector, and come into that sector in a much more strategic/calculated way. It's always been Apple's MO; Blockbuster never adapted and that led to their demise, but the jury is still out on how Apple can become the consumer touchpoint for most of these AI use cases. In a gold rush, they're not selling the shovels nor are they digging through the earth. They're the ones creating jewelry out of the gold and selling that to the consumer.; Have you tried those features? It’s trash which is very weird as Apple usually releases polished features compared to their counterparts.; Apple Intelligence has made zero improvement on my life. I’m still hoping for some practical use cases when apple fully unleashes it.

I have never gotten a useful reply from Siri, not once.; Haven’t seen a single one of the features; zoom out; So, in its very early stages, something like Vision Pro…  

Never bet against Apple.; Honestly though, a phone is less intrusive than glasses.; google just released AI glasses; > We will all interact with an Agent at some point and this will be very, very profitable for the company that provides.

Maybe. Maybe not. It's not at all clear that this will happen, because for it to happen the technology has to improve massively and it's not at all certain that things will go that way.; Sure, good point, APPL was trading a long time in early 20s, would say forward PE of 33-34 is still reflecting AI hype

Companies are either growing, paying dividends or out of business. ; 1) You’re missing the impact of factors such as withdrawals, fees, taxes, etc. Look up “Sequence of Returns Risk” as an example of what withdrawals can do to a portfolio. You’re also assuming that everyone who inherits money will do the same as you, as well as you, and with the same goals.

2) Owning individual stocks within the S&P [or any other index] isn’t the same as holding the index. Individual stocks potentially carry a lot of risk. Many of the top performers of “yesterday” are no longer around. That doesn’t determine the fate of top performers today, but history often repeats itself [or at least rhymes].; 10% yearly in average over decades is many times over even the worst possible inflation scenario.; Buy , Borrow , Die; Hence, “takes money to make money.”; My 2 cents..

If you invested in individual stocks and they are part of the considered big 7, enjoy your luck or calculated risk assumption that paid off. I guarantee you that these stocks will not perform with that rate when your kids and their kids take over your stocks. Some will even be at the same or lower price level at that time compared to presents time.. fun fact, if marc cuban didn't sell his yahoo shares the day after the agreed due date, he would be worth  50 m a year later, not a billionaire who used part of that money to buy Maverick. We are talking about Yahoo which was considered an internet tech innovator at the time..consider Nvidia, not many predicted this chipmaker will be worth 3.5 trillion while intel is 88 b..many more examples..so you really wouldn't know how it will work out next decade, decade after..

If you invested in sp500 consistently, you are still lucky enough cause that is where the phrase comes into effect. Time in the market beats timing the market.

It covers every topic you just mentioned.; Health insurance lobbyists would like a word.; Next couple centuries right; This means nothing in the realm of profit and loss. Tech always advances but the problem with tech is it cannibalizes itself. In other words, tech companies burn bright at times, but also have short lifespans with very few exceptions.; They say every 3rd generation squanders wealth; Heyyy spoiler alert! Hehe :-); If QC can crack SHA-256 encryption the entire global financial system is gone, not just Bitcoin.; At some point and it’s a ways off quantum computing will bust crypto which means that crypto will have to employ quantum computing as well.

I'm a pretty conservative investor so I put my money mostly in ETFs...

But i bought some Google shares since I wanted to invest in QC and with Google, you can do that almost without the risk of your company going bankrupt. You would also invest in cloud computing and AI at the same time + Google's P/E ratio is very low compared to other tech stocks so it was the perfect pick for me.; Scares me and makes me want to make an exit from Tech; An index will hedge you but you still take your knocks when a stock drops.

132,Apple launches its ChatGPT integration with Siri,"Apple released updates for its iPhone, iPad and Mac software on Wednesday that include a long-awaited ChatGPT integration with Siri.

The ChatGPT integration triggers when users ask Siri complicated questions. When Siri is asked a question that Apple’s software identities as better suited for ChatGPT, it asks the user permission to access the OpenAI service. Apple says that it has built in privacy protections into the feature, and that OpenAI won’t store requests. The integration uses OpenAI’s GPT-4o model.

Apple users don’t need an OpenAI account to make use of the ChatGPT integration, but users can pay for upgraded versions of ChatGPT through Apple. Users can also access ChatGPT through some text menus.

The iOS 18.2 release is a critical milestone for Apple, which is relying on Apple Intelligence to lead the iPhone 16 lineup’s marketing campaign. Apple Intelligence is the company’s suite of artificial intelligence features. Apple first announced the ChatGPT integration back in June.

Apple released the first part of Apple Intelligence in October. Those features included writing tools that can proofread or rewrite text, a new design for Siri that makes the whole phone screen glow and notification summaries.

The company says it will release another update to Apple Intelligence next year that includes significant improvements to Siri, including the ability for it to take actions inside of apps.

Many investors believe that as Apple Intelligence adds features, it will boost iPhone sales, drive an upgrade cycle and potentially cement Apple as a leader in consumer-oriented AI.

The integration is also a major victory for OpenAI as it puts its most important product in front of millions of iPhone users. Neither Apple nor OpenAI have disclosed financial terms for the arrangement.

Users need an iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Pro or any iPhone 16 model to install and use Apple Intelligence, even though the ChatGPT integration primarily uses cloud servers. Owners of iPhones can turn on software updates in the General section of the Settings app.

After updating to the latest Apple software, users who have not yet activated Apple Intelligence can sign up for a waitlist inside the settings app. Users typically receive access to the software within the same day. Their phones will need to download large files, including Apple’s AI models, that the service needs to operate.

The Wednesday updates also include Apple’s image generating app, called Playground, which can create images based on people or prompts, and Image Wand, a feature that allows users to remove objects or flaws from photographs.

That should have been done 6 months ago...; Honestly, its ok, at best. I have used it for a little and although it is better than previous Siri. It is not what it still should be. I think even if ChatGPT completely replaced Siri, it wouldn’t be as good as you would think. Only time will tell; Yawn; Google has completely taken the thunder today with their Gemini release.

Gemini 2.0 Flash is just amazing.  But at the same time going to cost a small fraction to run compared to the other models.  Not just because of the TPUs but because it is a Flash model.; Okay, why can’t I have it on a 13 pro again? It’s not running on the phone, it’s chat gpt; Apple is so far behind in the AI game. Almost embarrassing for a company its size.; it was up and now it's down while everything is still up.; siri sucks.; And still can’t tell you the weather or do simple math the like it could in version 16 and before. 17 and 18 are a disaster. ; Don’t see it on mine; I’ve been waiting so long for this; Excited for this; Fascinating move by Apple! This ChatGPT integration could be a game-changer for how we interact with our devices. As someone deep in the AI space, I'm excited to see how this impacts user experience and app development. It's interesting that they're limiting it to newer iPhones - probably for processing power. I wonder how this will stack up against other AI assistants. Speaking of AI tools, I've been working on Opencord AI for social media engagement, and it's wild to see how quickly this tech is evolving across platforms. Curious to hear others' thoughts on how this might change your daily iPhone use!; ugh; Was planning on buying an iPhone 16 but the delayed and underwhelming reviews on Apple Intelligence have really killed it for me. I’ll likely upgrade to the 17. Hopefully we’ll see a new design and Apple Intelligence will be more figured out by then. ; 6 years ago; It's like that average looking, B-grade celebrity couple that entered a marriage of convenience (e.g. Harry and Meghan), and we're supposed to clap 👏 ; Glad to see Flash is back to being supported; Does Google's proprietary TPUs actually run LLMs better than nVidia GPUs? Have they been benchmarked for the same tasks?; cause they want you to buy a new phone.; Because Tim has leap calls and he wants you to buy his new phone?; ChatGPT is the fall back when the on phone AI is not enough.; You’re mistaken. The majority of the new features  run on your phone except for one optional integration into ChatGPT and web summaries. 

It still requires the new Siri (which runs locally) to try and do things locally before it’ll request ChatGPT for anything.; Same reason that perfectly good devices were falsely software crippled, and then the cover up story was about perfectly good batteries being no good.

The crooks who orchestrated this massive fraud were caught and now serving time in federal prison.  Just kidding.  No justice of any kind happened and those responsible live with insane wealth and blissfully fearless of any consequences.

Edit - because someone will try and saw there were consequences, well yes, they did have to run a time limited promotion offering $60 off the $250 charge to change a $20 battery, a process which drove more profits and profitable upgrades and more e-waste.  So yeah, no actual consequences.; Why being surprised. Isnt this how Apple has always been?; So who's ahead? I'm yet to see a lot of useful AI features, no matter who's making them.; Almost?; Apple has effectively been using AI in their devices for like 5-10 years. It just isn’t called AI and the features have names. 

Please use your brain next time; Hopefully it will be upgraded; The ChatGPT integration looks so bare minimum thrown together.; It is speculated that they are a lot more efficient.  Which would make sense as Google is who invented transformers and they control the entire stack.

The TPUs are also why Google can offer a much larger context window than everyone else.; What new features? They did not show anything.; No, five to six years has been the standard. Starting with the 15 five years is a [formal commitment](https://www.androidauthority.com/iphone-software-support-commitment-3449135/). 

(And unlike Android phones it’s rare that one’s carrier will restrict Apple updates. That’s the upside of homogeneity.); Yup and some of them are just worse versions of the original, like Microsoft’s copilot runs on ChatGPT but it’s a dumber version.; https://aistudio.google.com/live; You don't think ChatGPT is usefull?; Like they did with 17 that broke most Siri features besides timers? The company fired their best engineers for being too expensive. They can no long fix things. They can’t even get Siri working again with basic math and weather. 

Cook claiming breaking math and weather were broken on purpose because of privacy is just lame.  ; You are talking about OS Update and security updates. Not necessarily features.; https://aistudio.google.com/live; That's not a feature, it's just a playground. Where are the actually useful features and tools other than ChatGPT?; That's a product, not a feature. ChatGPT is about the only AI tool I use and it can be quite useful.; Use your camera and talk to it on the live stream part"
133,Is a trillion dollar valuation possible for Spotify?,"In all the investing subs I am surprised that more people are not mentioning Spotifys 2030 ambition. In 2022 they presented their target for 100 billion in revenue by 2030. They claim they are ahead on their plans so far.

At 4 billion euros in revenue last quarter they obviously have a ways to go. But surprisingly, ads made up just 472€ million of their revenue, while subscribers made up just over 3.5€ billion. What’s more, they have 2.5x as many ad supported users as premium subscribers, meaning they have a ton of room for improving ad revenue. I imagine they are planning on ad revenue growing rapidly in the next 6 years. It seems they could easily double revenue without adding any new users just by growing ad revenue.


I know it’s very speculative, but what is their potential market cap in 2030 if they hit their target? Is it possible that they get above 1 trillion one day? Or is this overly ambitions given the market they are in?

FWIW they have YouTube in their cross hairs. I have been seeing more and more songs that have the „video“ option, and only within the last week I saw that „super simple songs“ recently added a video to their latest song (they are of baby shark fame and one of the biggest creators on YouTube). With podcasts having video and being able to easily monetize that with targeted ads from Spotify, it seems that the line between Spotify and YouTube is becoming blurred. 

It seems to me like Spotify is a good long term play and can be anywhere from 5x to 10x 6 years from now.

The biggest risk is competition. But Apple Music is really just for Apple users, and even then Apple users seem to prefer Spotify. Globally it seems like there is a lot of room for consolidation. For example, Siri is really just USA, and other countries also have their own audio apps. But globally Spotify seems to be the clear winner, and I would imagine that consolidation happens.

What are your thoughts? Is Spotify a good long term investment?

Edit: also AI is a huge risk. I’ve been using Suno and it is pretty great. But Spotify is also known as a leading tech company. Google „agile the Spotify way“. Many European companies are trying to emulate their approach to the agile process. Meaning that I also have some faith in their ability to innovate and execute on the software end

Edit 2: luckily, with stocks, we can put our money where our mouth is. I think they’ll 5x-10x in 6 years. Also: the projected global ad revenue is projected to reach 1 trillion in 2030. Due to ai, I see Google search ad revenue decreasing. In addition to premium subscribers, there is an absolutely massive opportunity in ad revenue which they have yet to tap into",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hbsm2a/is_a_trillion_dollar_valuation_possible_for/,0,2024-12-11 13:43:05,"No; Absolutely not

I was debating it for a couple weeks, and that's what pushed me over the edge.

Hard no.; No; When you put it like this it all sounds reasonable but checking on that stock I get mixed positive reports and opinions...proceed with caution I also read.; In the scenario of spotify at $1trillion, what’s the value of $1? Money printing could make anything worth anything in USD.; I don’t think you know the huge difference/distance between 4billion, 100billion and 1 trillion. You might want to start there.; It seems about 4 years behind Netflix’s growth, and I think will follow along. So Netflix is currently at 390 billion market cap, and I think SPOT will be there in 2028. I would argue that Netflix has more competition. Personally i don’t really use Netflix anymore and only find things I’m interested in on HBO, Hulu, and Disney.

But Spotify to me looks like in a better position to have control over the audio media (music, podcasts, audiobooks) and now they are adding video.


Let’s see. 

RemindMe! 1000 days Spotify at 400 billion; That is true. I also see suno as a concern and potential competitor. But at the same time, I’ve seen people use suno to create songs and Spotify to publish and monetize. It could be an advantage to have a platform that has AI music while also allowing a user to filter out all AI generated content.

I saw that Spotify was also doing some integrations with notebook lm for AI generated podcasts. 

One thing is for sure: Spotify is embracing AI meaning they are unlikely to be left behind. Hopefully they can navigate it correctly; But this is anecdotal. They’ve actually increased premium users faster than projected after the priced hike.

Also, does YouTube premium have audiobooks? This is the killer service IMO; I don’t even know why I respond, but anyway: 
- 4 billion is in euros and their last quarterly revenue
- 100 billion is their yearly target 6 years from now (so 25 billion a quarter)
- 1 trillion is the market cap they could reach one day, considering that in just 6 years they target 100 billion revenue.; I will be messaging you in 2 years on [**2027-09-07 13:14:43 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2027-09-07%2013:14:43%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hbsm2a/is_a_trillion_dollar_valuation_possible_for/m1ipah3/?context=3)

I invested in 2020 due to exposure to their software before they went public.

Here is a solid ""DD"" from someone else that hits on some key points I believe in:

""$PLTR valuation makes ZERO sense But then why do institutions keep buying it? What do they know that you don't? I work in BIG DATA analytics and let me share the secrets of Palantir in the most basic way Palantir has monopoly on Automated Governance, serving as the ultimate Operating System for Data and Global Decision-Making. The world is starting to see the massive benefits of AI agents developed on the Palantir platform, which boost efficiency, drive higher earnings, and outpace the competition. 

Over time, Palantir will reign supreme among AI agents, with all other AI entities eventually integrating into the powerful Palantir Ecosystem. This is just the beginning. Think of $MSFT Windows. Before Windows, people relied of MS-DOS (which is another OS) and before that it was CP/M which were really bad Operating Systems. The Tools didn't talk to each other. You couldn't multitask. You couldn't perform Technical Analysis while at the same time executing the trades. You couldn't stream your games on Youtube while playing it. It was limited and fragmented into separate sessions and executable files (.exe). You were LIMITED, much less efficient. It is exactly the same for all Governments and Corporations and right now. They've grown so big, beyond scalability. Tons of data are being generated by too many programs, locations and departments. Each source of data have different expertise of people with totally separated ownerships and power over the data (e.g. Business Dept. vs Manufacturing Dept). Just like it was inefficient or impossible for MS-DOS to transfer data from one application to another in real time. It is inefficient to transfer the data from one department to another for a simple decision-making. It takes so much time, resources and too many meetings. It could take days if not weeks to get it done. Why? Because of ownership and qualifications over the data. If you don't work in the Business department then you don't qualify to play with that data. 

If you don't work in manufacturing department, you can't own the data. So in order to unify the two data sources. You are reliant to different groups. That's only one small example. Think of your responsibilities in your own household. One partner is probably more accurate on handling the grocery list and school events while the other is more reliable in fixing cars and backyards. As a 3rd person (perhaps an accountant), you would be reliant on each of them to provide the receipts for their own spendings. This is where Palantir's Ontology kicks in. Voila, it unifies every single data source and specialties within the company. Think of Palantir's Ontology as a digital map for a company's data. It organizes all the information in a way that makes sense, connecting different pieces of data to each other and to real-world things, like products, equipment, or customer orders. Imagine you have a messy room with all your stuff scattered around. 

The Ontology is like a system that helps you organize everything neatly, so you can find what you need quickly and easily. It's a way to make sense of a lot of data and use it effectively. Palantir solves scalability and reduces big corporations and governments down to its core principles, to make a good decision. With Palantir, it is much easier to grow, digitally. “There were 5 exabytes of information created between the dawn of civilization through 2003, but that much information is now created every two days.” — Eric Schmidt “Information is the oil of the 21st century, and analytics is the combustion engine.” — Peter Sondergaard “Without big data, you are blind and deaf and in the middle of a freeway.” — Geoffrey Moore Companies don't like to be blind and deaf in the middle of a freeway nor to be underperforming to be punished by the stock market. 

Eventually, all the data we generate will be more complex and too much for humans to digest them all. We will eventually need a AI to do that job for us but more importantly we need a stable platform for AI agents to stand on, you can't throw an AI agent in the water and expect to swim. AIs need.. ONTOLOGY. Think of AI agents as Culinary Chefs. The Palantir AI chefs will have all the ingredients and tools in ONE COMMON PLACE to make magic happen, enabling on-the-fly decision-making without the hindrances of bureaucracy or data ownership issues. 

This unity is the game-changer. Palantir is... A Super Integration Company And that is vastly more superior and transformative than the hype of 'AI' You can hire the best Chef in the world but without fresh ingredients and tools, he will never be effective. So that's why it's not just about AI agents, it's more about what's available to them, a unified kitchen full of many ingredients, recipes, assistants and tools. PALANTIR ONTOLOGY is precisely that Kitchen, an Operating System of Data and Global Decision-Making Just like how $MSFT has become essential to our every day lives, $PLTR will become essential to every single businesses and governments in the world. It's just matter time. The monopoly is here to stay. Is $PLTR valuation through the roofs? Hell Yeah, but what's the alternative? NONE""

136,"Overvalued Companies (PLTR, SHOP, CRWD)","
The market right now is filled with young companies reaching impressive highs and earning steep valuations. Each has its own story, and for investors, the challenge is finding the next Mag 7 or something close to it. 

I’m curious to hear your thoughts on which of these companies might have what it takes to rise to the top and why. Some examples I’m considering are PLTR, SHOP, CRWD, APP, RKLB, and a few others. I wasn’t around during the early days of Amazon, Apple, and similar companies, but I imagine they also went through cycles of intense enthusiasm, stock price spikes, and corrections. Could we be seeing something similar play out with these names?",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hblmf3/overvalued_companies_pltr_shop_crwd/,92,2024-12-11 05:37:53,"ABNB, CVNA, CAVA, ELF etc. etc.; $SHOP is my biggest holding as I’m up +1,200% since May 2017 with a cost basis of $8.92. I’ve taken profits over the years and now it’s just continuing to ride. I haven’t followed the stock in a few years, so I don’t have an opinion on value or growth prospects, but I’m largely bullish on digital payments and eCommerce, so I don’t see what could slow this train. 

Curious to hear what others think of Shopify long term.; i’m extremely bullish on CRWD because i work in the industry. fantastic product and is the gold standard for EDR; Buying over valued stocks... what could go wrong? ha; Palantir is the most obvious one to me; What about RDDT ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm); From your list, I like PLTR and RKLB.
Yes, all are technically over valued and need to “grow” into their valuations.

SHOP is solid but quite mature so I don’t see massive future scale. Maybe if they did something really unique like acquire payment processing. Otherwise their TAM is limited. Love the company though.

CRWD I like as a leader and security will also be a big issue. Just getting more and more competitive. I can also imagine other more AI entrants emerge to steal share.

APP this one to me is almost all speculation. The others have more merit to being valued as much. Just my opinion and at these levels.

RKLB if they can truly establish themselves as a solid #2 or #3 in the space sector could be huge. I also live their end-to-end model that isn’t even reliant on launches. I don’t think most are even aware of this. It’s the riskiest one listed but also smallest market cap of the group. Also like Sir Peter Beck. Smart, innovative yet scrappy and efficient.

PLTR is my favorite. Might revert to mean a bit but long term trend is still up. LLM’s get all the hype and chips to support AI. But the value is actually being able to use AI ti extract meaningful insights from complex systems. Whether its defense intelligence, supply chain efficiency, spending efficiency, PLTR has a 10 year head start. FedRamp high is also huge. The market size is huge and growing.

RKLB and PLTR are my two 10 year holds. (Other than VOO and real estate) I mention to show diversification.; Possibly. This is the story with great growth stocks. The hope is that some will do so well the success will more than make up for the stinkers. Growth investing also concedes there will be some that crash big time.; I recently went into APP as well. I find it really interesting how they turn their AI marketing tech to anything mobile. I really hope the recent correction will lead their way up.; Let’s see them move higher I’m ok with making them more overpriced…crwd to 450 PLTR to 125 next year let’s go; COST, TSLA; CVNA?; is RCAT overvalued?; $wing; Of all of these, AppLovin is the only one which has a chance.  
Rapidly growing earnings, low scaling costs, good margins so strong moat.  
But I'd rather invest in companies which have these characteristics and aren't so expensive.  
That's why I'm betting big on YMM and a smaller amount on BKNG and TCOM.  
(I should've bet big on APP a few months ago but foolishly, I focused on Plus500's lower scaling costs and lower valuation and didn't take into account earnings growth. Won't make that mistake again.); $TSLA has to be on this list. The PE is now what? 160x?;  TSLA?; ServiceNow; this means its a buy; try MSTR, lol; Palantir isnt actually young, but it’s gotten traction in commercial business recently (other momentum is coming from index inclusion and supposed political tailwinds); Surprised Hood isn’t being talked about here; FICO; PLTR for sure, I was not able to justify when the stock was $12 and can’t justify now, but time will tell.; Personal experience... I bought CRWD when it tanked after the Microsoft/airline scandal and then sold it all when it hit $320. I'm sorta pissed that I missed some of these recent gains (and will hafta pay capital gains on my meager profits) but I'm also convinced it will fall back to $220 again pretty soon. Thing is, you're right. All the firms you cited are solid companies that are simply overvalued at the moment. Every last one of them will be on sale in the next six months. Have patience and keep some dry powder ready.

\*I also ALMOST bought APP when it was under a $100 and just never pulled the trigger, for instance. Sucks. I do think it will become buyable again in the near future but even this recent pullback doesn't quite tempt me. Again, patience is what I'm stressing.; SHOP must have more blood.; Just dumped cvna and trimmed abnb; ABNB has too much regulatory constraints (ie cannot rent for more than N% of the year), plus with housing crises and rent affordability only increasing this top-down/bottom-up pressure squeezes any long term value.

(I formally held a position in ABNB but sold.); Been trying to figure out why CAVA is nearly three times the value of chipotle; I've been holding it for 3 years now, sold off a little when it spiked recently. I've used Shopify for 5+ years and there's nothing even close to being as competitive imo for medium to larger companies for a turn key ecomm platform. There's competition for smaller companies but overall unless one of them can really make huge strides I would have a hard time believing can catch up to them anytime soon.; Congrats! Been loading up on SHOP the past 6 months. Wish I discovered it earlier.; This doesn’t address the valuatuon though.; I’m in cybersecurity as well. Caution is just because a product is good doesn’t mean a company isn’t overvalued.; You don’t care about valuations coz you are a buy and hold I’m assuming?; What do you do in the industry? Never seen someone who works in the industry say this; Of this list, I’d say go in on PLTR. With President Thiel & company coming to power, it will only moon. The rest may crumble if there’s a recession but President Thiel will save his ass with some juicy defense contracts. 

Personally, I’m a boring VOO guy tho but feel like PLTR is the play if you’re stock picking.; I don't take anyone serious who's clearly married to PLTR. Everyone knows it's over valued except the weird culty stock holders; App? They had insane blowout earnings last call.; You don't mind the obscene valuation? Arguably biggest bubble valuation in the entire market right now; was wondering if anyone would say COST. I bought two shares in 2021 and they have literally doubled in value. by far my best performing stock but for some reason I am afraid to buy more.; Way too many bears have died on that trade and have PTSD from seeing those four letters; According to Yahoo finances, 25377 pe, easy peezy; !remindme 180d; I thought we were discussing serious companies, not meme stocks.; Just bought SMCI and CVNA puts “just in case”; CAVA is worth less than 6x of what CMG is...what are you on about?; Oops, that's not how stocks work 🫣; dont search the news articles - they always spin the stock to match the trend and price. 

example, in 2021 when nio was 40 goldman sachs released an article saying how nio is the future and could easily scale with a price target of 60. 

now, goldman sachs lowered their price target to 3.90 sighting ""profitiability concerns and fierce competition"" . 

Despite nio sales literlaly 5x'ing since 2021 and  margins slowly getting better. profitability and compeition was always a concern, Id argue even bigger back in 2021. 

if CAVA crashes 95% they will release articles about how the busines model is dead etc.; lol what?  I think you missed a turn. WSB is on the left.; This is finance 101, we are looking for value, a good company adds to value but it isn't everything,  PLTR had GREAT value at $6, but $60 all good news is priced in.

They offer a great product for the public sector, but not at this price.  I'll keep my eyes pealed for a pullback on CWD. Not in cyber security, but I'll think about buying the dips; ""it's not what you buy, it's what you pay""; Buy good companies and you will be fine. Valuations will sort themselves out over time.; Agreed, sounds like the take of a tier one IT help desk, not a security professional.; this might have been just what I needed to sell my PLTR shares; Not married to it, but if it dips 20% or so, I’d consider engagement; I respect anyones view that’s making healthy consistent returns.; The tailwinds with the Trump administration and very promising. Time will tell.; Never underestimate culty holders; Totally get it. Candidly, it didn’t pass my radar until it was much too late and I’ll admit I don’t know it well enough. Just felt mobile marketing wasn’t “big” enough opportunity and missed the run so didn’t dig in.

What I do like looking now is it really seems like their estimated earnings is too low based in trends so likely another blow out quarter. Just not sure what true expectations are.; What does it matter if you’re holding for 10+ years? Realistically if you’re not a short term trader this doesn’t matter. DCA into these companies and hopefully reap the benefits in 10+ years once the meet their valuations and more; Like someone else said, this is specifically my speculative, long term holding. I have a thesis and of course could be wrong but I accept the risk.

Valuation is tough on a company that is fairly recently profitable. PE is a better tool for more mature companies with earnings history. For instance, people point out CVNA. But that is a horrible use of PE as they just turned back to profitable earnings so it's a tiny amount.

With PLTR the thing I love the most is rule of 68 which is pretty much unheard of and warrants a premium. They are seeing major revenue growth but also increasing margins so earnings expansion! So I do believe they grow into a more reasonable valuation over the coming years. Maybe stock triples while earnings quintuples type scenario.

Another example is NVDA about a year ago their forward PE was in the 60's. But the earnings that actually came in were quite a bit higher and would have actually been closer to 27. So that 60 was highly inflated because expectations were too low.

It's also a great stock to do a wheel strategy with.

And no, it hasn't priced in 30 years of growth. lol.

I am by no means telling anyone to buy PLTR. Super risky. It's my attempt to find a smallish company that will be the next MSFT, META, GOOG, NVDA 10 years early. NO ONE knows what will be that next NVDA. I have enough of that exposure with my index fund holding.; I’m really curious now how it’s gonna fair now that Amazon has entered its moat. Will bears finally have their fill?; Lmfao wow, is that the highest PE for a company ever? How is it maintaining this price level?; !Remindme 60d; I will be messaging you in 5 months on [**2025-06-09 09:20:18 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2025-06-09%2009:20:18%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hblmf3/overvalued_companies_pltr_shop_crwd/m1i0ta4/?context=3)

|-|-|-|-|; CVNA puts are so expensive, what did you get? I was looking at the Jan27 $150p, but couldn't pull the trigger, gonna wait a little.; Growth potential in USA and Europe already factored in.  I believe they already stated they are opening a whole bunch of stores all over the place.; My b, I was just talking about the stock price. Not company valuation; We use it at my organization as well. I am in information security but not in the area that uses the tool. I have had my eye on the stock but have not pulled the trigger yet.; fair. I mean I’m not holding it either as I said in my comment. Just have FOMO from what’s going on.; ill buy them; Just buy it now and hold. If it dips 20% buy more. Getting hung up on a valuation for a 20 year screaming buy is where almost everyone goes wrong. Nobody that bought apple 20 years ago cares if it was at a peak day or discount day. Same for meta. Volatile first year of trading and doesn’t matter—everyone who bought and held is filthy fucking rich. There are so few of these companies that come along, maybe 5 every 20 years. NVDA, PLTR,MSTR buy all day long at any and every price these markets are giving you. 

Zoom out. Think long term.; Lol as someone formally deeply entrenched in Apedom, trust me,  I know ahaha; This is a great point and I'm taking the advice, I'm putting auto buys on PLTR to DCA, but I'm also going to finish taking some profit at these valuations.

That should satisfy both my cold feet and appetite; How about the fact that it would take 10+ years to grow into the valuation your paying TODAY.; That it has already priced in 30 years of 30+% growth doesn't matter? Lmao; Trying to forecast 10 years...haha; I disagree with almost everything you wrote here. Good luck; It's better than a negative PE 🤣 which plenty of companies have.; ABNB gets hated on Reddit, but I think it's a solid buy around $100; And what are you talking about? The person i replied to said CAVA is worth more than Chipotle. That is definitely not true.; Why does the stock price matter?; Think long term, sure, but 400% in 6 months?; Good idea. I can’t say whether it’s a good buy or not just the fact that people spouting valuations like it’s the gospel are usually thinking in the short term for a company like this.; Yea if absolutely nothing changes over the next 10 years. When is the last time the economy and the rate at which a company expands and grows stays the same/consistent for 10 years??? Never. Like I said. DCA into it and it doesn’t matter. Pick up a bunch when it inevitably dumps to $30 then stop crying; lol I can guarantee that people said the exact same thing about every company in Mag 7 and people like you would’ve said it was ridiculous to invest in them at certain points. Things change with time. Growth may increase way more than 30%. Time will tell.; Businesses like this can grow at 100% per year over and over in this phase; What, you don’t invest long term? It’s nothing new to invest in a company for 10+ years. I’m talking about investing not trading.; No worries. Everyone has their own opinion. I was simply sharing mine and of course you are free to provide your helpful insights to OP’s question as well.; To me, stock price is what the market values the company at. But I’m still trying to understand how CAVA ($127) is worth 6x less than CMG ($65). Can someone take this as a teaching opportunity instead of just downvoting?; So you’re saying you agree this thing is massively overpriced and dca when it takes a dump down to 30ish a share? Then i agree.; Except they are growing mid to high 20s…; You might be getting downvoted (not by me though) bc stock price doesn’t really matter, just market cap, PE ratio, etc. lots of great YouTube videos and blog posts out there after a quick search. Happy learning!; Cmg had a split recently. It was well over 1K a share. Share price doesn’t matter when it comes to value. Look at NVDA also.  Multiple splits.; A company’s market capitalization is share price * shares outstanding.  If I have one share outstanding and a share price of $1000, my market cap is $1000.  If I have 1M shares outstanding and a $1 share price, my market cap is $1M.

So the $1 priced company is worth wayyyyy more than the $1000 priced company in my example above. 

Market cap is a good proxy for the company’s valuation (what the market thinks the company is worth), albeit “enterprise value” is a better metric for this (market cap + debt - cash).  

Does that make sense?; I never said it wasn’t overpriced lol my original comment literally said just DCA into it. I know it’s overpriced but I’m still putting $100 a week into it in case the market stays irrational for the next 2 years and it keeps trucking forwards. And I’ll continue putting $100 weekly if/when it dumps to $30 and then I’ll be laughing in 10 years when it’s worth $200 a share.; in a down cycle economy with extremely high interest rates; Yes it does, thank you for taking the time out to explain that to me; 200$ a share ? Lmao. To be worth that it would have to grow like double the rate it’s growing now, for the entire 10 years.; Dude we can sit here and argue all day about what it’s gonna be in 10 years. Both of us have no idea so I don’t know why you’re laughing lol it’s already closing in on $100 and you think in 10 years there’s no possibility of that doubling? Get off your high horse. You probably sat with your thumb up your ass all the way from $20 saying it was overpriced and you’ll sit on your ass for the next 10 years. I could lose my money or you’ll be regretting not taking the risk. One of us will be right.; Refer to my most recent comment about us having no idea. Market can stay irrational for way longer than either of us can predict. So I’m not going to sit here and pretend I know what it’s going to be. Could be $30 or it could be $200. I literally have no idea. But in 20 years I’m hoping I’ll be able to look back and thank myself for not listening to short term “investors” scared of their own shadow; Stfu dude, tell me what reason does pltr have to suddenly, in 1 year, bring up 300% when nothing at the company has fundamentally changed.? They have barely been hitting their projections, barely making money, growing modestly, by far not hyper growth. Stock price Completely disconnected from the fundamentals. Let me tell you why ? AI hype. I like the company and think long term they will be fine. But only really investable if there’s a major correction."

Apple was grinding for a long time, but the iPhone is what made them a juggernaut. If someone else had come up with the iPhone, Apple would likely be much more like Dell today.

  
Google was making money like crazy and its stock trended upward pretty much immediately.

  
Facebook bounced around a little early on, but they are somewhere in between Apple and Google. They were making good money, but required a good deal of innovation along the way to be what they are, as Facebook proper likely has declining revenue. Without Instagram, and all the other bets they are making (like AI), their stock would likely be much smaller.; You need to start with a vision for the future. Below are my beliefs - you will probably disagree with some of these, but everyone needs to have their own point of view so they don't chicken out and sell amidst market volatility. I don't need all my predictions to play out either; if half of these 10x in the next 10 years, I will be outperforming the market.

Cybersecurity - CRWD and S

Cryptocurrencies - HOOD and COIN

Space exploration - RKLB

Quantum Computing - MSFT & GOOG; doubtful one of the small companies will win against these giants

Industrial internet of things - IOT

Autonomous cars - TSLA; I'm not kidding

Flying cars - ACHR and JOBY

Gig economy: UPWK

Reddit: RDDT - I don't even know how to label this thing; yes we're in 1999 again; $HOOD seems to be quite a disruptor imo. I would not be surprised if it 5x in the next 10 years.; [deleted]; Rddt and hood; Pltr 🚂; $HOOD will end up being a monster; RKLB is 20% undervalued according to Simply Wall Street’s DCF model.

And honestly…. It’s early innings

I think it is undervalued. Maybe not from a classic value perspective. But, what the market will eventually price it as.

There’s youtube vids on PLTR that have 126K views

There’s 11K post tagged on it on instagram

On RKLB

Youtube videos with RKLB max out at like 14K views and that’s not the majority of them.

And on instagram the RKLB tag has only been used like 1000 times.

And not even all of those are even about rocket lab the company .

We are in the early innings I feel.

Plus, 🚀 means to the moon and this company is called rocket lab.

I see it catching fire.

Their profits are just way too low to justify the current valuations.; Also a long time holder of PLTR, always said one day they will be as big as Lockhead Martin that said, wow that was fast. I took out my initial investment and kept 100 shares in the game. 1 trillion dollars in valuation, that sounds crazy and it is, however they have started partnering with existing big players and may become the go to for AI in defense, especially with Aundril which I thought wouldn’t want anything to do with them on board tells me something. So I will not be selling even if it is over valued in my mind, also keep in mind the commercial aspect, they saved airbus 33%, that’s the power of AI.; I build analytic models.

That being said, $100 dec 20 calls; They addressed that years ago, they won’t make scalable products only be-spoke ones that work, in my opinion something like snowflake is more of a tool not a solution for internal teams to solve problems, PLTR solutions actually help identify and then solve the issue, who else does that?; 🤝; I hate that that's what's happening; When has business ever listened to engineers anyway; Next week $100 call?

The only thing wothwile in their demo was their notion of ontology which is something any company that replicate. Standardization of features and construction of features is nothing new. See H2O platform. 

What do they actually solve? 95% if time biz doesn’t even know what they even are asking for or need. If their “tool” is good for discovery analytics, and it gains traction in small to medium sized companies that have the infrastructure to do it in-house, I’d explain Azure ml or aws sagemaker or anyone of these ML for dummies platforms to replicate their approach. 

They’re not selling we’re analytics platform. Tableau is one. They’re selling we’re an AI shop. If anyone actually knew by AI they mean building a quick classifier for anomaly detection off of sklearn then I need a more in depth explanation as to why they’re blowing up other than a bunch of naive people thinking something else entirely.

I simply believe that when they said that be-spoke solutions are better, from my experience, I can say that the benefits are there, the cost is also there. I have tried and failed and seen other programs at my company try and fail to make a one stop shop, that ends in disaster, absolute disaster because one engineer got to greedy, it taints the product and becomes useless, I plead with people to make a ecosystem that is fully modular. I think Palantir made an ecosystem, that’s why I believe in them.; I see, not a bad idea, if it is back up to 80 range then you can already make $1000 out of these 20 calls; It's really a gamble. If they aren't included then I expect a 30% drop easily. Fundamentally this company is worth $25-30 a share at best, no reason to be siting in the 60-70 range.

MSTR is not a business worthy of adding to the index. They don't produce any signature goods or services. It's just a greater fool scheme.

to paraphrase, if corn fell substantially, the multiple on NAV would probably shrink to \~1, or could even trade at a discount to the corn holdings if insolvency became a risk.

it trades at 2.53 mNAV per diluted share currently, at 377.32 / sh, so a 1x multiple would be \~149 / sh at current btc price, then drop that figure by whatever haircut you want to give to corn.

80% drop in corn would be \~$30 / share, unless I'm mistaken on the mNAV math.; Probably similar percent to its recent rise vs bitcoin; It would unwind spectacularly, Saylors MSTR would drop like it did in 2000 for different reasons but still, the man will have managed to pop that shit again.; Oh man was I happy to sell at 50% profit last week; Planitar pleas fly again 🚀; No. This is just the speculation.; 100% confirmed from Bloomberg.; It's 100% confirmed from Bloomberg.; MH or after close?; Yes; definitely to the right; PLTR joining Nasdaq was confirmed weeks ago and it jumped 10%.

Moving their listing onto nasdaq and being included into the nasdaq 100 are totally different things

They moved their listing from NYSE to nasdaq a couple of weeks back

 The Nasdaq will announce which companies are going to get added to the Nasdaq 100 on the 13th...google the news...there is no confirmation of Palantir getting added as of this moment; Google it...there is no news/confirmation that Palantir has been added to the Nasdaq 100...companies that get added are announced on the 13th of December

It this is 100% confirmed, I highly doubt Bloomberg terminal is the only source with this news and it hasn't already spread to other news outlets by now; What amazing timing! Are you still holding the calls? Also do you think this Nasdaq push will allow it into retrace to its monthly highs just below 700?; Did the math, if MSTR drops or goes up 10%, it is a mere  .046% change on QQQ, that is basically nothing lol.; I get it, no one invests for their software business though. The software business has shrinking revenues and loses two dollars for every dollar they bring in, after 20 years in business.

The valuation that's 200x their revenue, and stock price, are not based on their software business.

But people do invest and place value in their financial offerings and the promise of ""bitcoin yield"". That sounds like a financial product from a financial company. And that seems to be their primary offering.

I don't care either way. But let's not take their word for it. 

If I sell meth off of a farm, that doesn't make me a farmer.; Correct; I love microstrategy but this is a pretty big stretch. If something like 90% of your growth is fueled by bitcoin (or from your perspective, the lack of shrinkage due to fiat inflation), the 10% of growth fueled by software does not make you a software company, even if that’s what you were previously.

If airbnb starts buying oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico and 10xes, they aren’t a tech company anymore, they’re a petroleum company; Maybe not right now. But many people are rich for having gone all in on MSTR in the past year; It really is the infinite money glitch 😂 ; it was the % drop scenario discussed in the interview I linked.; Pics of dicks; 100% confirmed to be expected; Rumors are better than news; ... then can't wait until they are delisted...; Arigato calls for next week safer?; Yes; Yes the point is everyone knew why they moved to the Nasdaq so they can be included in the 100 again read the post; Still holding, I think the price is currently consolidating at around 640, so If there aren't any substantial market shifts, it will likely start going up again. These are my thoughts, and I could be very wrong :D; Thank you for doing the math! It proves a very good point that this guy is handicapping himself for no reason.; Not many farms on QQQ.

They are a software operating business, with the best balance sheet in the world.; Ah yes.

What the fuck do you mean ""so they can be included again""?

They have never been in the Nasdaq 100...getting into the nasdaq 100 is a totally different thing from moving their listing to Nasdaq...moving your listing to Nasdaq doesn't automatically grant admission into Nasdaq 100

And FYI, no one was talking about admission into Nasdaq 100 when they moved from NYSE...the price spike was simply because they moved their listing; https://preview.redd.it/p30py706iq6e1.jpeg?width=725&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=568abb52a99172889f2a81ac9ac1d7ca1f9f887a; btc price has nothing to do with spy price; Again….Read the post!

BTC will probably catch Apple this time next year. MSTR will probably catch em in the 15-20. Should be fun to watch!; Yes, it does. It’s a first mover and has been since around 2016. If crypto crashes so does spy. Look back at previous data.; Apple could buy double MSTR's bitcoin stash tomorrow using only cash on hand, and still only use half of what they have available.

Apple instead has spent $100B buying their own stock.

MSTR pays off old debt with new debt and rotates through the bills before they become due. They do not have a great source of revenue or profit as of yet. Hopefully they're developing something.

MSTR has a great advantage of being the first to take that strategy, but the reality is that they aren't doing anything unique, and would be at a disadvantage to anyone else who has enough cash to match or a better reputation. 

It's going to be fun for a while, but if you think MSTR is going to overtake Apple, it's going to take more than stashing BTC in the basement and market volatility as a primary product. They're going to need income.; the typical btc cycle does not correlate with spy price. sure if a big economic event happens then liquidity gets sucked out of all markets, not just btc and stocks. 
by ur statement, ur saying spy also has a 4 year cycle which is not true; Yup. Apple has had a shit load of cash and could have bought a lot of bitcoin over the years...and still could. But they dont need to. So they most likely wont. Like MSFT.

They have already inegrated BTC into apple pay and will probably have a native wallet sometime soon. That will be used onboard a lot of users as btc becomes more ubiquitous. 

The crazy thing is that as big as BTC seems, its actually very tiny compared to scale of global assets. It could do a 20x and still be an 1/8th the size of global bond market. It probably  will over time.

MSTR is and will be the largest corporate holder of BTC, so they will be a good position to make use of their capital. Next year they will be able actually mark their gains on their balance sheet. So Q1 2025 they have some ""earnings"" to post.; That is incorrect. Drastic moves in crypto are followed by drastic moves in equity. There's plenty of research out there confirming this to be true.

They're expanding like crazy with legit partnerships - [just locked in Parsons for government/defense contracts](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/parsons-globalstar-announce-partnership-demonstrate-210900371.html). Those government deals could add another $20M annually by year 5.

Their XCOM RAN tech is crushing it with 4-5x performance gains over old systems. No need for a reverse split when you're actually growing revenue and landing big fish customers.

Options are totally fine right now. The company's got plenty of runway with their Apple deal and now these defense contracts. The bears were wrong about GSAT needing to reverse split.

🚀 Position: Long shares and Jan 2025 calls; Nah bro, you're missing the bigger picture here. GSAT is sitting on a goldmine with [Apple's $1.5B investment](https://finance.yahoo.com/m/9245aa07-2a43-3e68-aa3b-7058dd02cb05/apple-to-bring-satellite.html) and the Watch Ultra satellite feature coming in 2025. Who cares about a reverse split when [they're landing fat government contracts](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/parsons-globalstar-apos-software-defined-215424231.html) and their revenue is actually solid ($223.8M last year).

Look at their cash flow - [$65.5M operating cash flow](https://beyondspx.com/article/globalstar-inc-gsat-powering-the-future-of-satellite-and-terrestrial-communications) ain't nothing to sneeze at. Plus they're about to be in every bougie Apple fanboy's Watch Ultra AND iPhone. That's like printing money with extra steps.

141,Unity Technologies ,"https://preview.redd.it/hbzkp23fz26e1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=698c4992c16ee91fc7afc47c3a28e81add772ebc

Unity Software Inc. (doing business as **Unity Technologies**) is a technology company that specializes in developing and operating a platform for creating real-time 3D content and experiences. Unity is primarily known for its game engine and development tools, which allow creators to build, run, and monetize interactive 2D and 3D content across various platforms.

Their engine and development tools is used in wide range of industries including Video game development , architecture and design , automotive , film and animation , and virtual and augmented reality.

They are a duopoly in the game engine market with Epic Games (Unreal Engine). Unity holds approximately 40-50% of the game engine market share, while Unreal Engine accounts for 10-20%. As of 2023, over 70% of the top mobile games globally were developed using Unity's platform. In 2024, mobile gaming is expected to generate approximately $92.6 billion in revenue compared to $51.9 billion for console gaming and $40 billion for PC gaming. As of 2024, a significant portion of VR apps in the Apple Store are likely created using Unity, with estimates suggesting that over 60% of AR/VR content across platforms is made with Unity.

Unity's stock have been doing poorly ever since the great 2022 bear market , the John Riccitiello fee incident (2022) , and the dreadful IronSource purchase (2022) under his tenure. They have since fired him in 2023 and appointed Matthew Bromberg as Unity's new Chief Executive Officer, President, and a member of the Unity Board of Directors, effective May 15, 2024. Bromberg has since replaced all the C-suites with competent people. They did a reset on their portfolio to put their focus on their core business which they refer to as their ""Strategic Portfolio"": the Engine, Cloud and Monetization.

The Strategic Portfolio consists of two main segments:

* Create Solutions: This segment encompasses Unity's game development platform and tools. In Q3 2024, Create Solutions revenue grew 5% year-over-year, driven by subscription growth. The Create segment includes:

1. Unity game engine and development tools
2. Unity 6, the latest version of the engine with over 500,000 downloads
3. Expansion into non-gaming industries (Industry segment), which grew **59% year-over-year and represents 18% of Create revenue**

* Grow Solutions: This segment includes advertising and monetization tools. In Q3 2024, Grow Solutions revenue declined by 5%. It focuses on:

1. Advertising technology
2. Monetization services for game developers
3. Development of a new advertising model set to launch in 2025

Let's talk about the mobile gaming monetization and advertising space and their competitor AppLovin (the stock that is up 768% YTD) . AppLovin wanted to buy Unity for $20B back in 2022 to form a monopoly but got rejected. Unity has since failed to keep up with AppLovin who is now the third largest mobile gaming in-app advertising network after Google and Meta. Unity-ironSource platform just can't compete with AppLovin's superior algos and platform but things are about to change because the new CEO hired Jim Payne to join the company as Chief Product Officer for Advertising effective August 12, 2024. Payne co-founded MoPub, the world’s largest mobile in-app ad server and exchange, and MAX Advertising Systems, a mobile header bidding platform (both acquired by AppLovin). In their latest earning's call Bromberg said they have a new machine learning model in their new neural network that is being tested on their live data that will be ready to launch when it's ready (probably sometime next year). APP's current mcap is $111B while Unity is at $10.78B , if their new ML model is competitive , the stock can easily **5x from here just from the Grow Solutions business**. This is why some people are looking to short AppLovin and long Unity.

On the Create Solution side Unity recently announced on Oct 30, 2024 they hired Ex-King CTO and Havok Co-Founder Steve Collins as CTO which will add key technical leadership to accelerate product innovation, quality, and stability.  In 2023, Havok products were used in twelve of the top twenty best selling video games in the United States. Here are a [list of games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Video_games_using_Havok) you probably heard of that used Havok physics:

\- Dark Souls 1-3

\- Bloodborne

\- BioShock series

\- CS:GO

\- Half-Life 2

\- The Last of Us

\- Halo 2 & 3

\- The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild & The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom

Now let's talk about war , Unity's engine and development tools is also used by the DoD

The Department of Defense (DoD) primarily uses the Unity engine to create realistic, immersive virtual training simulations for military personnel, allowing them to practice complex scenarios in a safe and controlled environment across various domains like combat tactics, vehicle operation, war simulations and situational awareness, all within a 3D digital world.

Unity Technologies Corporation (UnityTec) has been awarded two significant contracts related to the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD):

* [JETS 2.0 Contract](https://govtribe.com/opportunity/federal-contract-opportunity/dla-j6-enterprise-technology-services-jets-2-dot-0-sp470923r0001-45) : UnityTec secured a position on the Defense Logistics Agency's J6 Enterprise Technologies Services 2.0 (JETS 2.0) multiple-award, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract. This contract has a maximum value of $12 billion and will provide a broad range of IT-related services to the entire DoD for up to 12 years.
* CACI Contract: Unity signed a ""multi-million dollar"" contract with enterprise technology firm CACI to become the ""preferred real-time 3D platform"" for U.S. government defense projects.

I don't think even the Palantards know this , [Palantir's Mixed Reality](https://www.palantir.com/offerings/mixed-reality/) offering is built with Unity's 3D engine.

[The future of warfare is powered by Unity's 3D engine.](https://preview.redd.it/zw7w2aj2z26e1.png?width=2379&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4f900c7489db3c6841321cb494c66a8c0035add)

Now let's rewind it back to 2015 when [Mark Zuckerberg sent a four page internal email](https://sriramk.com/memos/zuck-unity.pdf) to key executives to get in early on the AR and VR future. In that email , Mark Zuckerberg wanted to purchase Unity because he believes AR/VR is the major computing platform after mobile and they will gain control over a key development platform for AR/VR content. He believes the acquisition of Unity would also mitigate the risk of a competitors like Google and Apple from acquiring them and limiting Meta (Facebook then) access to the platform. One of the possible reasons the acquisition fell through is antitrust concerns because Meta would be a monopoly in VR/AR if they own Unity.

I believe the future is XR (extended reality) and that XR will be next major computing platform after mobile. I believe Meta will become the largest company in the world within the next 10-20 years, which is why I’m highly optimistic about Unity, given its significant role in the XR ecosystem. This is a long term investment for generational wealth.

This post is made for posterity.

---

**Ticker:** U

**Direction:** Up

**Prognosis:** Long-term buy, potential 5x return.

**Reasoning:** Unity, a dominant game engine with a large share of the AR/VR market, is undergoing a turnaround under new leadership.  Improved monetization strategies and key hires (including a former AppLovin exec) suggest significant growth potential in their ""Grow Solutions"" segment.  Furthermore,  substantial DoD contracts and use in high-profile games like *Dark Souls* add to the bullish case.  This is a long-term play for generational wealth, predicated on the belief that XR will become the next major computing platform.

**Extra:** Even Palantir uses Unity's engine, and Zuck tried to buy them in 2015!


**Author's Position:** 2800 shares, long calls and short puts.; CS:GO is now CS:2 and doesn't use Havok, it uses Rubikon

All games in your list are many years old, that argument is so stupid it only hurts your thesis.; So, you're betting on a turnaround which may or may not work out while the stock is already up 30% in the past month because of changes in leadership.

Seems like a risky bet at this level unless we some evidence of them successfully getting their shit together.; Beat Saber, Cult of Lamb, Untitled Goose game. There are colleges in the heart of Manhattan that offer Unity Training for graduate level classes.  Look at ARTI 605 at NYIT. 

  
I am a fan of the stock personally. I do own some shares, but not many as I am a small time retail degenerate.; I'm holding 500 shares, but only because I got in at $100.

Seemed like a great play back when it went up to 200.; You say meta will become the largest company in the world yet you are arguing for unity? Seems fishy, just get meta then.

Unity broke trust with developers, their main customer base, when they announced a per copy fee unilaterally to be forced upon everyone.

Reason some studios still use it is because a game is usually 3-5 year project so if far enough along it's cheaper to run with your current tools vs switching.

But new projects, they are not going to unity, because no way will a company making games will take a risk on an engine that one day decides each copy sold will have royalties paid to the engine company if they ever decide to put this policy back in.; Thank you for the dip. Opened a starter today.; Imo ,I wouldn't invest in unity cus I think unity engine sucks ass 

But so do Tesla cars and Tesla is doing well.; Iam holding 320 shares of this! Lets goooo; [I mean it's kind of crazy the 12 Month Google Search trends. Unity hasn't exactly died....](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fg%2F11qpzy882z,%2Fm%2F0dmyvh,Godot&hl=en)

Unless you're Greenland.; As a developer I think Un-Real will continue to take space, however unity is so cheap and gets the job so done and lets creators have more controls, toss up a real toss up, both have eco systems but with the games coming out of un-real looking amazing, I mean what am I supposed to say theirs not a wrong answer.; Last time I touched this it went to shit.; Fuck Unity.; Yeah, no matters how promising unity sound i can't see dev teams switching to it, they lost lots of customers on their previous pay plan. In software industry, what is lost is lost.

Every earning is blood bath everytime for some reason it keeps boucing like if unreal 5 was not a thing

Nvm shit already pumped 15%; > Apple Inc. plans to bring satellite connections to its smartwatch in 2025 and is ramping up work on a blood-pressure feature, seeking to entice hikers and health-conscience consumers into upgrading their devices. 

> The satellite capability is slated to come to next year’s Apple Watch Ultra, the company’s top-of-the-line model, according to people familiar with the matter. The technology will let smartwatch users send off-the-grid text messages when they don’t have a cellular or Wi-Fi connection. 

> The other feature, which would monitor whether Apple Watch users have high blood pressure, may arrive as soon as 2025 as well, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work is confidential. But it’s been delayed before, with Apple previously aiming to release the tool last year. 

tbh the healthcare shit is still more bullish tho

> The company first launched a satellite communication feature with the iPhone 14 in 2022. It let users stay in contact with emergency services while off the grid. The capability was expanded last year to allow for contact with roadside assistance providers. Apple then upgraded the feature again this year to let people use it to text anyone via iMessage.

> The Apple Watch Ultra would be the first mainstream smartwatch with satellite abilities. 

> The move also could give consumers less reason to use a standalone satellite communication device, such as Garmin Ltd.’s inReach.

> Apple’s service relies on satellites from Globalstar Inc., which has expanded its partnership with the iPhone maker over the past few years. 

> In November, Apple invested about $1.5 billion in GlobalStar to beef up the infrastructure. Apple took a 20% stake in the company as part of the deal.; if they could take over garmins hold on the camping/backpacking gps market i think it could be massive; $GSAT $GSAT $GSAT; Global star gsat 🚀🚀🚀; GSAT baby; Can someone explain to me the ASTS vs GSAT comparison?

Idk, im too poor for smart watches. ; Why do I need satellite technology in my watch? Genuine question. I tried using Apple Watch 9 for a few months and ended up giving it to my kid.

I can’t think of a situation where I’d choose my Apple Watch over my phone to text… I can send txt via my AW Ultra 2 and almost never do. Furthermore, the gps mapping software out there for the AW is garbage. I’d use a 3rd party iPhone app every day; They’re gonna need to build one that can go for more than a day or two days if careful, while allowing GPs usage. I charge my Garmin weekly and that includes gps usage; Just bought a whopping 9 shares…; Yessir; Well, commercially GSAT is obviously more useful than ASTS currently. Other than that I don’t believe the two to be comparable at all. ASTS will be providing subscription-style 5G cellular broadband globally via partnerships with MNOs. Due to several factors such as orbital altitude and satellite size/design, it seems GSAT will really only ever be capable of providing text/voice at scale. ASTS demonstrated data speeds of 21mbps so far with an eventual (target) speed of >35mbps and a latency <30ms. GSAT’s gen2 satellites are capable of speeds around 256kbps with a latency of ~15 seconds.

Globalstar is positioned well to make a whole of money for an outstanding service, but comparing it to the proposed services of ASTS and Starlink is apples to oranges.; They’re going after different business segments right now. Most people don’t really think about the XCOM RAN IOT technology GSAT has.  Walmart is testing this tech in two facilities right now and it may prove to be very profitable in coming years. 

GSAT controlling bandwidth is very helpful to their prospects, and allows them to offer bandwidth offloading services in dense radio environments. 

ASTS is currently focusing more on providing broadband directly to handheld devices anywhere. They have awesome technology that will probably outperform their peers speed wise, but I’m still skeptical about their overall overhead for keeping a large fleet of the most technologically advanced satellites ever built in operation. 

GSAT does all their processing on the ground through base stations, meaning lower overhead costs and easier upgrades as technology advances. GSAT will not be able to provide the same level of broadband as ASTS at first, but they should be able to be quite profitable with their current prospects. 

ASTS is very exciting and may make a ton of money, but it’s really difficult to accurately estimate the cost associated with a service we’ve never seen operating at full capacity yet. We don’t even really know how the telecoms intend to price ASTS’ service yet. There are just so many unknowns in my opinion.; gsat cant do 5g; On Apple or GSAT ?; My watch charges in like 30ish min or less i throw it on my stand when i shower or something its all it needs.; I've got a Huawei GT3.

Their end goal is to compete with starlink and be a direct provider of connectivity to devices anywhere in the world; If Apple found a way, leveraging GSAT, this would be huge. Apple as a service just sounds right. ; Sigh. Please do a !remindme in a few years :); I agree but they’re at least 5 years behind.

144,Uber vs Everyone,"Alright unless you been living under a rock you heard or seen some videos of self driving vehicles be it waymo or tesla. The future of self driving vehicles is not a question of if at this point but when .
My question to you is this - how do you see uber play out in this changing fat environment. In your view do you see uber benefiting or losing from the rise of AV brought in by smaller and bigger companies.

Here is my take and I’m also not fully clear (I think the CEO needs to come out and clarify clearly their path and their different partnership goals).

Uber clearly wants to be a software company, the biggest aggregator of all mobility needs. They spent like crazy to be number 1 in travel. They spent like crazy during Covid to be the number 1 food delivery service. They spending like crazy on grocery delivery from what I notice and they eye to grow their freight business.

All their investments and actions points towards the aggregator strategy , from offloading their own self driving decision to Aurora to investing in all kinds of different startup from Serv robotics to Aurora (25% ownership) and companies in India, Asia and Latin America.

Can this strategy back fire? It could, however let’s ask , what does Google want? Google up until this point was mainly a software company, yes they produce their own pixel phones but I believe their main competitor is not Uber but Tesla. Google might be expanding their taxi service but is the end goal for them to be a global taxi company? I think not. There is much more profit in expanding the waymo service up until they prove that their software reached maturity. At that point Google will lease that software to any car manufacturer for a price, growing revenue in speeds that they won’t be able to match staying exclusive, hence the Tesla competitor. In the scenario that they lease/sell their software to any car manufacturer, it won’t be the end of the road for Uber because at worst case they can purchase a fleet of cars to continue their operations and supplement their other AV partners.

Now let’s assume waymo stays exclusive and Google interested to be a taxi company, meaning their partnership with Uber will end and they essentially going to compete with Uber. In this case, uber investments in Aurora Innovation might come helpful, they can re-acquire Aurora and their tech for whatever it’s worth and build on top of it. They can use their large cash flow to acquire a smaller AV company that struggles to compete with the big players and build on it. In both scenarios uber has a way out, as long as they don’t lay on their stomach blinded by short term profits (think BlackBerry in early 2000) and make sure to pivot at the right moment (if aggregator role dont workout, time to go shopping for small AV).

This is how I see it, I will be happy for anyone to challenge this view because sometime we all get blinded by our own biases.
",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hawqbu/uber_vs_everyone/,23,2024-12-10 08:46:46,"There was discussion that Uber was trying to buy Expedia earlier this year. 

IMO, the best case scenario for Uber in a time of self-driving cars (and I do think that these cars being ubiquitous is still quite a few years off - people are acting like it's tomorrow) is that Uber becomes the Expedia for self-driving cars.  And that's... *okay.* It's not a great position and it's a somewhat fragile one that requires having to manage relationships but it's something I suppose.

I don't think that Google wants to be a taxi company, but Google would certainly like all the data that comes with this as well as the opportunity to advertise to people potentially during the ride and through the app. Does Google want to manage the fleet? Probably not. Would they like everything else? I would think so. 

I think the missing element is who is servicing and cleaning all of these cars? If that's Uber, I don't know that that's a great business to maintain stations all around and be cleaning/fixing cars. If Uber owns these cars and maintains them, that's...not very compelling. 

Uber trying to become a travel super app by buying Expedia might make it a more compelling broad travel middleman for some potential self-driving car suppliers, but in terms of Waymo, Google has Google travel...which has been talked about as impacting Expedia for years.

Buying Aurora (note: am long AUR) and getting the expertise of the former CTO of Waymo, the former head of autonomy for Tesla and the Head of Perception and Autonomy Architect for Uber wouldn't be a bad idea but feels unlikely. 

I think Uber seeing a material impact from self-driving is still a ways off, but will be some degree of cloud over the stock from this until there's a more compelling vision from Uber about their role in self-driving. Stock continues to sell off and gets to the low 60's/upper 50's Uber will be technically oversold and maybe play it for a bounce but I think the discussion is going to keep coming back to what about self-driving cars.

""(think BlackBerry in early 2000""

Random/unrelated: I thought the Blackberry movie was pretty good.; Ubers model makes it so the driver takes on the expense of the car, insurance, maintenance and fuel. It is probably a better model financially than driverless cars.  ; uber will be fine. Neither google nor tesla will be interested in building their own fleet in the scale of millions of cars. Eventually they just sell their AV cars to drivers. And driver will let their car working on the platform with the most demand. AV is just something divining the cost of riding down and it’s a tailwind for uber and Lyft.; Uber is not going anywhere, at least for the foreseeable future

They have the largest network in the world and they just started improving their profitability. They have a steady revenue growth and they are still growing in terms of customers, number of rides, etc

One of their biggest successes is that the term ""Uber it"" has basically replaced the word ""cab"" or ""taxi""

It all looks great on paper. However, they are competing against the future. And that term means something else to different people. Be it AI, self driving, teleportation or whatever other nonsense people come up with 

And the second thing they are competing with is Elon Musk's popularity. Which is why the stock has gone nowhere all year. And why it randomly drops on news that has nothing to do with their actual business numbers; I don't get why the threat of self driving cars is causing such fear in Uber. Uber can easily purchase self driving vehicles, can't they? It also seems years away. People are not that keen on the idea. Also for delivery, you need someone to walk to your door. Many people who order delivery are handicapped and rely on these services. This is my simplistic view on their future. It's not like self driving cars will make these services cheaper...what is the point?; You tripping Uber bout to go off; What I find interesting is there’s a common theme between a lot of very successful businesses from completely different sectors, a company might start soley as an insurance company (let’s take Berkshire) but the key to growth is [re]investing in things that are not necessarily your core business. Apple has branched into the finance sector, apple pay, wallet, etc. Amazon just sells everything, like the most branched out you can get. 

And then Uber with all these different types of transportation. They’ll probably invest in the same type of tech Google & Waymo are doing anyway. I didn’t dig into it too hard but their financials are solid, I use Uber, I would consider it a consumer staple, and that key fundamental sealed the deal for me. Not a bad price either. ; Problem is all their competitors just copy what they are doing asap. On Black friday i ordered an apple tv for 50% off from staples on uber eats (they delivered it to my workplace within an hour not kidding). I was like shit i gotta buy some uber stock. The week after, door dash also offered similar promotions and there are new aggregators popping up everyday. The space is so crowded.; I don't own Uber, but I don't really get all the doomsayers. Autonomous vehicles have always been part of their long term plan if I'm not mistaken. Wasn't the idea from the start to build up the network with drivers and phase out the drivers as driverless tech becomes available? It sounds to me like they are just about to transition to phase 2 of their plan. I would be pretty surprised if none of the autonomous tech companies want to partner with Uber.; I think they are cooked in the long term.

Your thesis is basically ""big tech companies won't take their market share!"" - Yes they will.

Once consumers find out they can get a ride for cheaper with a Waymo or Tesla taxi, they will. The limiting factor will likely be how quickly Waymo and Tesla can get cars in the area, and once their offering is widely available, it is game over for Uber.

Uber may remain viable in small cities and towns where there is not enough demand to justify autonomous fleet and maintenance facilities, but if that is all Uber holds on to, that is a bad situation for shareholders. Food delivery is going to be stickier, but that business is not nearly as good as robotaxis.; If the ""when"" is 2040, then it is not relevant today to any investment thesis. I remember when self driving was the overwhelming consensus in 2017. The horizon just keeps getting moved out further and further.; It's going to be a long transition to self-driving taxis.

Possible scenario:

Waymo will be spun off. It will be a vertically integrated independent mobility company with a strong brand.

They may use Uber for demand.

However, Uber will be disrupted and needs to innovate by adding self-driving cars to its fleet using partners.

It's hard to predict if Uber will succeed and dominate or will lose to competitors.

It's going to be a long and windy process. It may take 10 years. May end up being a great investment but I'm out because I'm too old for that timeline.; If autonomous vehicles become available this won't be from just one vendor (or if so: then only for a very short while until you get chinese knock-offs come flooding in). This enables other players to quickly join the market. One such group I would expect to branch out would be car rental companies (Hertz, Sixt, et al.) as well as manufacturers themselves (Tesla has stated in the past that they might even stop seeling cars altogether and just use their own production for robotaxi services. While I don't think they will go that extreme route I do expect them to operate a big robotaxi business of their own, eventually.)

What this means with respect to Uber: While a shift to autonomous driving may increase their profit margins per ride I would suspect that the competition landscape will change radically for the worse. they will not be the only ones supplying software.

 Those who supply software *and* hardware will win.; Do I see uber be a sucesfull company still 10 years from now? Absolutely not. I would pay a 5 pe maybe like the legacy auto makers, it will be a business in decline very soon and the market is paying a premium for it. No thanks; I have to pushback on the years off comment. L5 is on the road now and Waymo is pushing 150000 rides a week. Maybe you meant throughout the US. But the tech is deployed now. And is being launched in Miami next year. The biggest roadblock is no longer the tech its regulations.; Your ride will begin after this short advertisement.; Waymo is simply going to partner with uber and sell the drivers internally a subscription via the app some kind of discounted Waymo self-drive software. 

But this is a decade away.; If there's a great return on investment (adjusted for risks) in ""letting your AV car work on platform"", the taxi supply will shoot up, and sooner or later, the ROI will fall to a mediocre value.


Same as what's now happening with classic Uber/ AirBnB economics.; The English speaking world uses Uber a lot, but there are other services in other countries. It think Uber is roughly 1/3 of the global market. 

Much of Europe uses public transportation or still uses taxis.

Bolt is very popular in Africa and Eastern Europe. Likely used more than Uber there, though I didn’t find exact information.

Didi chuxing in china


The USA is something like 50% of Ubers revenue. And Americans are notoriously fast at picking up new technology. So self driving could impact Uber sooner than people think.; Yea. Ubers has 7.8 millions of drivers. In order to have a shot to compete with that Waymo and Tesla needs to create millions of AV. That seems like years away. Not to mention not every state has approved AVs. If Waymo and Tesla dont control 99% of the market that favors Uber. Since that opens the door to individuals to buy the AVs as well to use on Uber cutting out Waymo/Tesla.; Self-driving is not approved in a widespread fashion anywhere in the USA. The only company with approval is Waymo, who require an extremely expensive vehicle for it to operate. 

Tesla is fundamentally fucked with pure vision-based self-drive. Hence why they have no approval anywhere to operate. 

Long story short, this will take a decade and in the meantime Uber can partner with Waymo to get the self-drive software for cheaper.; Correct. 


Waymo is literally expanding exponentially.

There are workers who take waymo more now then they did uber a year ago. 


I think that's taking market share peak definition lol; Except it’s completely possible that a de-facto monopoly can maintain market share and margins even as supply theoretically expands.; > Maybe you meant throughout the US.

Yep. I mean it's years off before it's everywhere.; Waymo is already partnered with Uber for network effects and logistics. They’re in Austin currently; I rode Uber 3-4 times a day for 8 days in London a couple months ago; Uber is banned in much of Europe, LoL. Something to do with ""drivers should be treated as employees"" law. F-ing commies! 


Asian countries all have ""copy-paste"" apps that undercut Uber's pricing.


I'm not touching Uber at 32 PE, when Google and Meta are trading cheaper.; I think we are years away from seeing self driving cars being the standard. Once they are and if waymo takes off, they r going to be just as expensive as uber. At least uber creates flexible jobs. Hindsight is 20/20. Uber was a great alternative to a cab, no I miss how cheap cabs were compared to Uber.; You can only maintain a monopoly if you have a moat. Having a 'software only' moat is almost impossible.; That’s old news. They are not banned in Europe https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/uber-countries; Europe has not banned Uber. In most EU-countries UBER has expanded in recent years.; Nah, that's nonsense but not odd to see it from some American loon in a flyover state. Ignorance is often a choice, as you prove.



In Europe we simply think people who work ought to be workers, and have the required checks and balances that comes with a job. Uber (for example) happily hired *convicted sex offenders* because they didn't bother with background checks, leading to *sexual assault by taxi drivers going through the roof*. And in almost ever case it was Uber/Lyft because they tried to weasel out of customer safety. *Rapists who got fired from real cab companies could drive Uber the next day* because Uber didn't give a fuck.; soooo emotional 🐶 Just to clarify, I'm not holding Uber, nor advocating for it. Like I said, ""not touching Uber, when there's Google at 22 PE"""

Italy's electric national grid. This one is probably going to not have too much growth but it's a good old solid utility stock. 4.3% div, in EUR.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hauqh3/top_10_nonus_stocks/,20,2024-12-10 06:32:15,"What makes these the top 10? There's no info provided to justify your list. What's your basis?; The top ones that come to my mind are: ASML, Spotify, Nintendo, Samsung, TSM, Sony; Investing in Taiwan certainly has some serious risk; Safran - French aerospace OEM. They have a very successful joint venture with GE to build commercial jet engines.; How can you make this list without constellation software? It's literally one of the best performing stocks anywhere.; These are stocks which may or may not be available to purchase in a US exchange.

1. **Hon Hai Precison Industry** (Foxconn parent co) - importance to electronics manufacturing cannot be overstated
2. **HDFC Bank** (India's largest private sector bank; private here means no government ownership) - after absorbing its parent HDFC, the bank's finances are undergoing a major shift, with all of the old high interest rate deposits being transitioned to low rate while the bank will now compete directly in the home loan sector. Think of it like the Indian equivalent of JPM but you are also paying the India premium to own this. 
3. **Tencent** - China's Disney with a highly diversified overseas income stream and controlling a huge chunk of the Chinese entertainment industry
4. **XFAB** - The company is in the midst of a transition to SiC manufacturing from legacy 150mm wafer production. The stock price has seen a massive beating and has become extremely undervalued compared to its long term potential
5. **Pilbara Minerals** - Australia's most efficient pure play hard rock lithium miner - stock price has taken a beating but the company continues to be profitable in spite of rock bottom lithium prices. The acquisition of Latin Resources will affect the mid term health of the company but it will also significantly increase their supply capacity. The company is also refining lithium in JVs with other companies, so they are moving up the value chain.; ERJ deserves a mention; $IGIC

DSV.CO

DOL.TO; No LVMH? Also don't sleep on Canada, many solid energy companies with dividend growth like Canadian Natural Resources ($CNQ, $CNQ.TO) and Tourmaline Oil Corp ($TOU.TO). Both didn't cut their dividens during Covid 2020; How about the Germany Stocks? Don't they drive the EU economy?; ASML is where its at. They are basically a monopoly at this point. What they do no one else can. And the barriers to entry are massive. Bonus is their valuation isn’t crazy.; Thanks for sharing; MDA Space - space without the hype; Growth & Consistency of financials, good ROICs ROAs margins etc. Reasonably understandable business that makes sense and would be expected to continue to grow from a soft-skill perspective.; Samsung is cheap at the moment.; SPOT is a lil expensive right now. Maybe if it were half the price at least; Theyre starting construction on their Arizona factory next year. That will drastically reduce risk. Plus there really isnt much risk if what youre talking about is China invading, TSMC will just blow up their factory, and China wont invade; Nice pick, adding that to my watchlist. Thanks; Great company and I have some. Too expensive right now; I’m looking into that Hon Hai one. Seems like a solid company but I’m not seeing much growth. (All CAGRs;) 10 Year sales 4.5%, 5 year 3%, 1 year -3%. And the dividend yield isnt high enough to compensate.

I think between Hon Hai & TSM, why settle for Hon Hai? Are they expected to make some investments that starting growing their business again?; Woah pretty solid finds. Thanks; A year ago I thought lvmh would struggle in Asia because of china economy . I was right; TOU dividend isnt high enough for me for a div stock.

I’m considering CNQ though from your recommendation. Good div and being raised every year. Looks good; Apart from SAP, Allianz and Munich RE Not Really; They have a lot of solid companies. Real high potential for growth? Not a lot.


Some other ones i found for Germany are, Wacker Neuson, Cancom, Adesso; Germany economy is all over the place, tbh.; Not too shabby; Investor track record is no Berkshire….; Just check holdings of Global ex-US value ETF. You'll get some interesting names.


Siemens is great at this point.


I think, in your list, you're also looking at names trading below ATH. There's a reason why they're soft and lost the momentum.; Due to political turmoil. Samsung is litterary the South Korean Government. They are the biggest share holder and Samsung is deeply ingrained into society running schools, hospitals, stores, renting out apartments etc.



If there is pilticial turmoil in South Korea Samsung tumbles, if there is stability Samsung does good. If Samsung hits a rough patch...Korea suffers.; I think it’s reasonably priced although I don’t own it. It made 750 million free cash flow last quarter. 4x that for four quarters and you’ve got 3 billion annual free cash flow. So it’s trading at 33 forward free cash flow while it’s expected to grow profits by 140% next year; They are aiming for 100 billion in revenue in 2030. if they hit that, their stock will be anywhere from 5x to 10x  6 years from now. Easily the #1 European stock.


BTW the 100 billion target was announced 2 years ago, and so far they say they are executing ahead of schedule; You didn't specify that value was a criteria, or what you used to determine that city might add more value to your post to clarify.; Why would you choose between Hon Hai and TSM? Just get both (and TSM is overvalued right now compared to the TWSE ticker, the PE gap is around 6 when it usually stays below 3).

Hon Hai/Foxconn does open new factories and assembly lines to meet demand. My thesis for them is simple: strong company with high expertise in their field. They will grow when the right opportunities present themselves over a 20 year horizon.; BRK.B stock at 2000 32.92  
INVE.B stock at 2000 32 SEK (so \~3$)

BKB.B now 463.87 or 14x  
INVE.B now 303.87 or 9.5x  
Investor also has a annual dividend of roughly 2% 

The last 5 years Investor is up 135% and Berkshire is up 100%

What metric are you judging berkshire on that you feel investor is failing at?; Investor AB has outperformed Berkshire over most time frames, for both intrinsic and stock price; Which ones?; It's still a moderately Cathy Wood style investment. I think they are a great company and their products are best or near in class, but they don't have a clear path to new growth in the future.; Yea I probably shouldve done that. I didnt put too much effort into the post itself, most of it went into the actual analysis (not shown); TSM is growing 20%+, Hon Hai is around 5%. I wouldn’t say TSM is that much more overvalued than Hon Hai given its growth rate; There's an index for that - MSCI World ex USA Value Index; I wasn't comparing TSM's valuation to Hon Hai. I was comparing it to 2330, which tends to have a PE gap from TSM of 3 or less but it is around 6 now. 2330 is TSM's Taiwan Stock Exchange ticker. Also keep in mind that the company is trading at a high premium to historical PEs which means one bad quarter can cause the company to crater in value. This is a cylical industry and once the current capex cycle ends the company's revenue and earnings growth will stabilize. I'm not going to attempt to predict a peak value for the stock price in the next five years since that is way beyond my depth and most pros get it wrong anyway.

Hon Hai (2317) is available at a much cheaper valuation so comes with margin of safety and an asymmetric payoff if you have a long term vision. I have bought it with a 20 year outlook in mind. I also own a decent amount of 2330 relative to my portfolio size.; I meant which stocks have lost their momentum for you; Do you kmow what the difference is between 2330 & TSM? Looks like its for the same company, TSMC, but i can’t figure out why there would be a PE gap at all between the US ticker and the Taiwanese at all. Seems like it would be for currency rates maybe? Or higher US interest than Taiwan. Is there a way to buy 2330 in the US besides $TSM? ; Brooo.. come on, look at volume charts, falling prices. 


Sorry to say, unless one has reasonably OK ""trend spotting"" skills, they won't do well in markets. Best to stick to index.; 2330 is the actual share which is traded on TWSE, while TSM is an ADR which has a claim to 5 shares of 2330.

Interactive Brokers offers trading on TWSE and that is what I use as a non-US person."
146,Stocks or Real estate which is better???,"Age old question... which has better returns? I realize it's apples & oranges! But looking for thoughts & advice!

North East rental market looks like $400-700 profit a month is possible. If I spent 300k on downpayments for 10 doors. I imagine in 30 years I'd make 8.5k a month. Or (100k) a year approximately. 

If I invested 300k in a mutual fund or etf or dividend fund could I expect to take $100k out for approximately 40 years...

The difference between the two aren’t just purely returns. You have to ask yourself do I want to run a business, or do I just want to invest in stocks?; I owned rental properties but sold them to invest and trade options for income. 

The calls in the middle of the night and other problems with houses and tenants was not something I wanted to deal with as I got older.; [deleted]; Financial planner here.  The truth is people have made a lot of money in both over the years.  The key issue is liquidity; if you need money fast and you have an investment account, you can click a button and have money in your bank account in a couple days.  That simply is not possible with real estate.  If liquidity is not a concern at all, then real estate can be a great investment.  Good luck!; Stocks. Real estate sucks; Rentals are a hassle. 

I rented my first house out for 3 years and got about a 4% real return after shenanigans.

Now. If you had a bunch of real estate prior to 2019 and held it until today, you'd be sitting pretty.; Usually it is like this:  
Stocks - higher volatility, higher risk, higher return  
Real estate - more work (tenats, reconstructions, repairs), higher stability  
It's always a subjective topic; I like stocks.
Liquidity, risk control, transaction costs, viable for my finances.; Sounds like a question for an FA. Stocks or index funds are certainly more “low touch” than real estate.; You can invest passively in rental RE without being a slum lord,; Real estate investing isn't as easy as you think it is, and someone with no experience in the game can get burned very, very easily. If you want the best of both worlds, invest in REITs. Otherwise, just stick to ETFs. Real estate can depend so much on where you are actually located in the world (Country>State>Region) whereas the same factors do not apply to stocks.; Have both. Use real estate to help build your stock portfolio.; Real stocks; Real estate companies have historically earned about as much as the S&P 500, [around 10%](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/060415/what-average-annual-return-typical-long-term-investment-real-estate-sector.asp) give or take depending on the segment. So it’s kind of a matter of preference. 

You could always split the difference by investing in a real estate company. Real Estate Investment Trusts are publicly-listed companies who own properties and for tax reasons distribute a majority of their profits to shareholders, in many cases paying out each month. It also allows access to segments most of us couldn’t afford to get into on our own. I can’t buy a [ski resort](https://eprkc.com/portfolio/experiential/ski/) or a [medical office building](https://www.americanhealthcarereit.com/about/) but I could own a sliver of a company that does. (Not recommendations, just examples.)

You don’t mention price appreciation, but many real estate investors count on that for wealth building, and that’s where the phrase “down payments” becomes very important. Borrowing to invest amplifies any gains or losses from the value of the investment itself.

Real estate offers unique tax advantages and leverage opportunities that stocks can't match. Depreciation deductions and mortgage interest write-offs can significantly boost real returns, which isn't trivial if you're optimizing for cash flow. Plus, with leverage, your return isn't just on your investment but also on the bank's money. Price appreciation is crucial but not guaranteed, and local markets can outperform national averages. With REITs, you get diversification but miss out on control and potential tax deferrals from direct property ownership. Real estate's not just numbers—it's about strategy.; As opposed to paying whenever, and not being responsible?

147,$GOOG the BFTG,"
Regards, grab your tendies and gather around the fire because I’m going to tell you all about *$GOOG* (aka Alphabet) the BFTG (Big Fucking ~~Tech~~ Tendie Giant). I’ll break it down for you because I know you polish that 🧠 real nice so I can’t expect a single wrinkle. 

1. Criminally Low P/E Ratio

While all your other tech darlings are flexing P/E ratios like a hooker in heat, $GOOGL is at 23.4 P/E ratio.

For reference:
* $SPX: >27 P/E (yes, the S&P500)
* $MSFT: >36 P/E
* $AAPL: >39 P/E
* $NVDA: >56 P/E
* $AMZN: >47 P/E
* $TSLA: >106 P/E (Fuck you, for the window lickers in the back)

Remember a “good” P/E ratio is traditionally around 20-25. If you don’t understand then read a fucking book.

2. AI Incumming

Sure, everyone’s talking about OpenAI and ChatGPT, but who’s making real money here? Google owns 90%+ of search traffic (when did you ever hear “yahoo it” or “ask duck duck go”?) and monetizes it like a legal cartel. Once Gemini (+Legacy Bard) gets some improvements and a little lipstick even MORE money. Oh, and don’t forget Google Cloud, which grew revenues 30% YoY last quarter.

3. Santa Rally - Ho Ho Hold Onto Your Bollocks 🎅

Historically, December is green season for big-cap tech. Funds rebalance, and retail apes are YOLOing. The Santa Rally isn’t just a meme; it’s a statistical goldmine. With $GOOG’s recent earnings beat ($28.5B in 3 months), the market’s about to price this in as snow starts falling.

4. Big Tech = Safe Haven

Recession? Inflation? Global chaos? Who cares. Big Tech don’t give a *FUCK*. Ad spending may wobble, but companies will NEVER stop buying Google ads.

5. Buybacks on Steroids

$GOOGL has a $70 BILLION buyback program active, the best part? They’re buying low and will push us even higher.

TL;DR: Google Is The Perfect Combo of Value & Growth.

Not financial advice. YOLO as your own risk. I’ll be adding more in two weeks having sold ESPP shares to raise more fire power.

How the fuck do I add a ban-bet? If I’m going to do this properly I might as well add some sauce.

SEE YOU AT THE TOP! 🚀

[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse); Damn. Now I gotta sell all my $GOOGL shares; So to summarize your DD:

Google is big and their P/E is at a historically normal level?; If you replace the G’s in GOOG with B’s you get BOOB; Just to add some more.

I'm biased as I have 4000 shares and $50k calls on this YOLO.

* waymo is beating tesla by MILES and years. The announcement of expansion made uber and lyft share price tank by almost 9% last week.

* google cloud is growing at 30%+

*YouTube is set to be have more hours watched then Netflix and cable TV combined. The ban of tiktok will be bullish for YouTube shorts and also $META reels.

* google Deepmind is one of the most advanced Tech hubs in the world. Some insane secretive work they do in tech & medical and more.

* They are the mag7 that are investing the most in Ai. Gemini expanding and they've made Ai for game makers. Don't forget $msft made its Ai move by partnering with openAi. But google is far ahead imo of products.

* search isn't going anywhere. Actually Grew almost 11% last earnings and is the cash cow. So much money they don't know what to do with it.

The most negative thing about is this the DOJ breakup. Or else google would be $250+ imo. 

Don't let that fool you.  Chromium is way too much if a risk and threat to break and sell off so it ain't going anywhere.; this just proves everything else is disgustingly overvalued; Who would've thought a tech giant is gonna make money; I’m copying your calls.; This already aged fairly well ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882); Already hold a million in this stock, maybe I should sell....; Well because of you I made 700 dollars this morning and took profits. Thank you sir; Thanks bro🎉🎉 First time scouting reddit for stock tips, hit it right on the bat there buddy; Seen a lot of GOOG push here past couple of days so its time to buy puts; Im in 200c Feb 21; fuck this regard was right; Got calls for this week. May have been too early; I still think in a years time NVDA will be the cheapest relating to the forward PE. I got laughed at in the beginning of 2024 when I said it was cheap at 450 (45 split adjusted) and I think headed into 2025 it’s still cheap.; Grats, you found a stock of one of the most famous company in the world that's not skyrocketing and doubling in price every week and not at a 52 week high... ughhhhhh i hate this market.; ""If you don't understand then read a fucking
book"". - OP

""Remember a ""good"" P/E ratio is traditionally around
20-25"". - OP; Any concerns the new admins going to attack them?; Nice, closed my Google calls like couple days before this post; This is aging like fine wine; Agreed, definitely undervalued.; My life is complete since my wife has worked there for 18 years.; Usob I’m in; 
I pray all ya tandies wont go to Wendy’s,; Buying leaps when GOOG was in the 160s was the right decision.; Followed your play and bought in for 25 180c 12/27. If this overnight movement holds up till open ill be hard pressed not to sell. What do you think; Read your thoughts and I agreed so got in on a $280 call for 12/27.  Paid $2.70 yesterday sold today for $8.10.  I wanted to diamond hands it longer but I had some meetings and it was just moving sideways after 9:40am so took the 200% profit.; Made my first options hit off this post, thanks man!; Thanks for this call. My first 1000% options.; [deleted]; [deleted]; Those days to expiration are too soon. Good luck.; I’m heavy on GOOG with shares and calls but color me surprised if MMs will let 180 calls print this month ![img](emote|t5_2th52|18630)![img](emote|t5_2th52|18630)![img](emote|t5_2th52|18630)![img](emote|t5_2th52|27421)![img](emote|t5_2th52|27421)![img](emote|t5_2th52|27421) Following this post.; So, OP thinks fundamentals matter?...cough...costco...cough; You late.

I already bought in at the 160 dip; Tik Tok Ban is confirmed. [https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/federal-judges-uphold-tiktok-ban-say-platform-us-rcna183106](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/federal-judges-uphold-tiktok-ban-say-platform-us-rcna183106)  
Youtube Shorts will get a lot of that traffic. Google's AI is also getting better.

Will this cause momentum to swing toward Google? Is anyone holding Options? If so, when is the expiry? What is the strike price?; they finally made you come back to work huh?; Good tendies; Thank you for the DD Monkes, got in at $185 $2.5c 1/17 and we are so up; Tailed the DD, barbecue chicken from there![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276); So are you fucking loaded now or what; selling all my googl first thing monday morning now; We all know GOOG/GOOGL is undervalued. Thing is: Are big banks and hedge funds aware of that? If not, we are still fucked.
(btw I’ve been holding for a while but have no faith in the stock).; Wow, you found this sleeping startup that truly no professional has any eyes on or information about. Imagine if the hedge funds realize what you are realizing and start buying this stock for their own portfolios !!; Based AF DD. Google's [cloud revenue is up 29% YoY](https://beyondspx.com/article/alphabet-inc-nasdaq-goog-navigating-the-ai-revolution-and-solidifying-its-tech-dominance) and they're absolutely crushing it with Gemini AI rollout. Your P/E ratio comparison is spot on - Google trading at discount compared to other tech giants. 

Those positions are juicy. Love the long dated calls giving plenty of runway. Smart play spreading across different dates/strikes. That TSLA put is *chef's kiss* - Elon in shambles.

Protip on banbet: Type ""!banbet GOOG (price) (timeframe)"" in the daily thread. 

GOOG literally prints money with [operating cash flow of $101.75B](https://beyondspx.com/article/alphabet-inc-nasdaq-goog-navigating-the-ai-revolution-and-solidifying-its-tech-dominance). Free tendies. 

Strap in boys 🚀🚀🚀; [deleted]; How about Goog owning 9% of spacex?; Just had a MACD cross last Friday too.; That TSLA put 🤖; I went all in GOOG last week..the writing is on the wall that its severally undervalued.. it's gonna take off soon; Im long 23k$ on GOOG, wonder if I should add more or convertbshares to calls; Almost forgot Santa's rally! Ok all in now; I just bought google stocks too. I hate inverse Kramer posses in this sub.; I've been saying this for months. Just too lazy to write it up.; One thing I didn't see mentioned, is who won the nobel prize in chemistry this year.

Two AI researchers at google deepmind did. With tech they made in 2020. While everyone else is making chatbots, google is solving the mysteries of the universe.; I'm all in as well. Check my previous posts. I feel much more at ease knowing I'm investing in Google with a P/E ratio of 23.5 (22 just last week) rather than in Tesla with a P/E ratio of over 100. 

On top of that, I also think Nvidia remains interesting with a forward P/E of 32.; So poots ? Or call? Shit. I can’t read that.; !remindme 2w; Long DD, but long term is always good with the big techs.; damn, how did op know that i shine my dome; Should have had the Dec 13 190 calls on there picked them up Friday  at .05 dumped  them at the open today  easy money; man if you went degenerate mode and all in for today x.x; Commenting so I can come back; LFG! All in, hoping for 10X bagger by EOY; OP when can we expect to receive your next update?; Which class of GOOG should I buy?; BFTG? What does that mean?; why should I invest into big tech that doubles in 3 years when I can gamble all my shit into quantum hype that doubled already the last few weeks and doubles again the comming weeks? this sub has become boring r/valueinvestment nerds fuck off; Wait, people trade on P/E?; All the X projects, I would discount since they're so far away--Waymo, quantum computers, drone delivery, space, modular fusion, etc.

For the immediate growth, I would focus on Cloud market shares/margin and YouTube subscription services. And some discipline in spending like real estate and hiring. Plus you might get a pop if Pichai decides to do something else.; Wow. $260 TSLA puts? Damn.; So the top is in. Got it. 📝; Baba is better; I’m down $10k on GOOG after buying the top.; i doubt that the average PE of the S&P500 is that high. Look at the PE without the Mag7 and the average is radically different.; A safer way to do this is to buy deeper in the money calls. Less risk, higher delta, less need for a massive move, less theta.; Did you ask yourself why Alphabet has the lowest P/E of the names you listed?; you actually have data and analysis to back up your trades?? LOSER!; So far it rose since premarket, despite the market pooftin' around since US open.  
Me likey!; RemindMe! 6 months; 23 is not criminally low that’s a normal pe before these stocks like crown strike and palantir got pumped to oblivion. Also goog is facing a antitrust on the search and advertisement business future is uncertain; [deleted]; RemindMe! 6 months; I'm riding with you; Bought my first shares last week.   Hoping to nab a few more early tomorrow sub 180.  Hell I might just keep loading up to 200 and let em simmer for a few years; How are you not gonna mention Waymo??; Didn’t even mention the massive TikTok ban catalyst, otherwise NICE; I oppose speculative bubble valuation. Stock prices should be based on business performance. A P/E ratio of 20 is very normal and average; it can pay dividends to shareholders. If you're just after profit, I suggest buying Bitcoin or drugs; those are pure profit, with greater returns come greater risks.; Even if you don’t read any of this guys DD. Just know the risk reward is good for goog right now. If you don’t know what that wlis. Stop investing lmao; Bro just tax loss harvest ur goog bags. 

Also, stopped reading as soom as i saw “bard”; Fuck you Tesla indeed; Why google went from 150 to  87 a share from 11/21 to 11/22? Overall Bear market or?; Any worries about the FTC

This makes too much sense; AI killed google, get over it. and their AI is the worst.; Everything Google related has sucked balls recently. Even Google search is crap compared to what it used to be. ; Can’t wait until they are broken up; Has anyone ever heard of this “Google” sounds like something your grandma use to do in the depression times to get ahead in the bread line.; one of the most shit stock of tech 

always fuck call; I laugh every time I see someone reference Googles PE. Clearly you don't know how to use PE amongst different companies/industries. ; [deleted]; [deleted]; I bet OP bought 3-4 months old calls at the top back in Aug and he's getting desperate as it reaches expiry date; Your welcome - this is your sign to double downs; Lmfao; is it goog or googl now; I don't like shorting but op really made me want to buy some; Me too. Fuck!!; OP is a true regard. Goog is about to get anally intruded by the DOJ.; Buy $GOOG instead its better; Their balance sheet is a fortress and their valuation is criminally low.

Don’t agree? Inverse me and let’s check in for 6 months time.; SOLD TO THE MAN WITH THE DRAGON. HOW DID I NOT SEE THE SIGNS?! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258); this is the comment I came here to read; Boobs are undervalued. Not women, just boobs.; TikTok won’t be banned it will just be sold.; What strike and date for the calls?; Casual $750k humblebrag over here.
I also have 4000+ shares! No opts tho; u/Wooden-Fix6280 congratulations on your behemoth win today sir. Are you holding or taking some profits? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276); So did this retire you yet?; DOJ could also force Google from iOS search default.  And AI is eating the Google ad business.  I rarely use Google search anymore and I don’t see why you want too since search is mostly stupid links to Reddit.  And why read all the Reddit comments when you can just get it straight from chatgpt or claude or perplexity???; And therefore Google is undervalued - I don’t make the rules I just want tendies; Idk, Intel manages to post billions of losses somehow ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); How insightful, did you use chatGPT for that? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883); I wish us both good fortune and Godspeed ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882); Fine wine and a good time.. for now ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275); ngl it flew today so...; .. me some more calls? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883); how do some of ya'll have so much money. I wish i had that much money :(; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258); Don’t thank me - thank the quantum computer chips ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882); Positions or gtfo ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267); The Christmas fund is set into $180 puts ilyk what happens; Hell yeah - balls to the wall let’s go; https://preview.redd.it/g0xjyi7l7a6e1.jpeg?width=792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1983363e91fb90921c09bdff08064aa5c0c9be28

NVDA is on 65B and would need to maintain its current performance for years to justify its current valuation.; literally 0 reason to buy google over NVDA other than boomeritis; Oh I’m sorry did you want some garbage to invest in? Buy some $HAWK and you can TUAH on that thang.; Hey, I don’t make tradition - the present market and my current positions completely oppose it ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); Trump has said specifically that breaking up big tech would be bad for US competitiveness with China.; Would be really suprised if they let chromium go into foreign ownership.

I can't imagine usa being happy when China buys 50% of google search.

Hence very unlikely to happen. And if it does, shareholders will still own the company. Just spun off as 2 separate stocks.; Possibly but I think the shock from DOJ has settled - it just comes down to if there’s action from the new leadership, who are generally against disbanding this kind of thing. Least of all to overseas investment.; If Google is forced to sell off parts of their company they could just sell it to a fully Chinese company since they would be the highest bidder. Most likely Tencent will purchase Chrome and Youtube then Google is now a Chinese company.; You’re welcome - short it or sell me some calls; Magnificent and fresh from the cellar ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882); Can she get me a job?; 🚀🚀🚀; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31224)![img](emote|t5_2th52|31224)![img](emote|t5_2th52|31224); Godspeed brother - Tendie town is a good place to be, +200% is not bad at all ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276); Stay tendilicious ![img](emote|t5_2th52|29637); Congrats brother - welcome to the casino, be wary of addiction ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); You’re expecting far too many wrinkles - did I not say slap lipstick on the pig?!

I agree other things being expensive doesn’t make it worth more but I feel it’s undervalued and oversold. 

Hell their market cap is over a Tril below their realistic equivalents.; Amen - and my risk/reward here is all 6 months from expiry; This mfer says “bags” when staring at a current gain with proof of positions.

Make it make sense ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); I believe it’s true value against the current market is near 220, but it will hinge on public sentiment with the ongoing DOJ/FCA disputes and that’s assuming the tech market doesn’t shit the bed; Trump is in power shortly and if track record is of any evidence impact will be minimal in the long run. I’m banking also in the short run or I’m not getting a home anytime soon.

Being 4x under the SPX PE ratio as this large a whale is non sensible to me. That said I’m buying OTM options, so with that what you will.; Still haven’t seen a single person make a purchase through ChatGPT and I’ve asked hundreds of customers - they consult ChatGPT but they still use Google to find and purchase the product.

Inverse me sweet cheeks ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); “AI killed Google”?  What in the fuck. I assume you’re talking about large language models and you think that is what AI is.  That people are still so ignorant about it makes Google a great investment right now.; What do you use that solves this issue?

That would be more like META at $90, with a P/E of 7.  GOOG just looks like a very, very good buy right now with an industry low P/E ration in the face of increasing revenue and net income without getting into their other ventures like AI and Waymo. ; I don’t disagree google is a good company, but all of your analysis on it is for long term.

Idk what to do. What are you doing? Looks like a run up ath?; not just YET.

  
Needs $250; The money is in searching for buying goods or services. Buying a chair? You google it and look for the places that sell it. Looking for a lawyer? You google it and look for one in your area to contact. Unless ChatGPT starts building or buying out an ad platform, they will only rely on subscription fees to grow. Thats not to say it’s not a lucrative business (ie enterprise subscriptions), but then you need to price it against likes of MSFT growth in that area.; You do realize GOOGL has Gemini which is superior to ChatGPT, and is integrated within google search already. Just ask chatGPT if you don’t believe me ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275); This is definitely one of the bigger issues Google is facing right now. Losing market share to other AI powered search engines. People are also turning more and more to places like reddit and Instagram when searching for opinions on products and services.; You know, that's great, I enjoyed my 20% run up in these shares over the last 3 years.  And I had to log into my brokerage to look it up, too.  Good thing I didn't have to get up off the couch.  Point is, I could've had NVDA instead and had a five bagger for my trouble.

And it's exposed by this DD and low iq comment; AI reduce google search, its the fact. There is no ads in ChatGPT yet, but it will happen. AI can suggest purchases already , soon it will accept advertisers, just waiting for more ppl to get into the pool first, same as many other startups. ppl ask AI for gift selections, dinnner location.... More business opporunity will merge. The bottom line is that search engine will be less impactful and thats the core business of google.; reddit..; You bet $3000, I wipe my ass with $3000.

148,China's domination playbook. How China dominates industry after industry.,"This is not the full story, but it is a very important story. Let's talk about how China dominates industry after industry. I will use the term ""China"" because Chinese government is highly involved in making Chinese manufacturers dominant.

**Part 1 – What is happening in automotive?**

In mere 3 years, China became the world's largest car exporter. The growth hasn't stopped either. The playbook that China is using is not new, we've seen it before. In solar panels, smartphones and a bunch of other industries. Let's talk about that playbook further down.

[From: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/1h9idy8\/](https://preview.redd.it/e4fn1lzarn5e1.png?width=1220&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f3b7d8ae6b41af72118921dea652a78f4995af1)

**Part 2 – Smartphones showed the way**

Around 2005, Chinese mobile phones were shit. They were mostly knockoffs of Nokia, SonyEricsson, Samsung and other established makers. Really bad knockoffs as well. Cheap, nasty, unreliable, uncomfortable user interface, etc. Market share outside China was near 0%.

Around 2010, large part of Chinese mobile phones were still knockoffs (examples [here](https://www.intomobile.com/2009/07/25/this-week-in-fake-devices-3-sony-ericsson-clones/) and [here](https://www.intomobile.com/2009/07/25/this-week-in-fake-devices-3-sony-ericsson-clones/)). But you now had som ok-ish Chinese products, e.g. [Huawei U8150](https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_u8150_ideos-3513.php), [Lenovo Q330](https://www.gsmarena.com/lenovo_q330-4860.php), [ZTE Blade](https://www.gsmarena.com/zte_blade-3391.php), [Meizu MX](https://www.gsmarena.com/meizu_mx-4373.php) and others. They were not good, but they were passable.

In less than 10 years, before 2020, some of the world's best smartphones were from Chinese makers. [Huawei Mate 20 Pro](https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_mate_20_pro-9343.php), [OnePlus 7T Pro](https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_mate_20_pro-9343.php), [Oppo Reno 10x](https://www.gsmarena.com/oppo_reno_10x_zoom-9654.php) and others.

Just before US sanctions, Huawei was world's largest smartphone maker for one quarter. It was about to cement its place as #1. But Huawei got sanctioned and Huawei phones are now barely visible outside of China. What is much less known, is that another Chinese maker become world's largest and it did it so subtly that almost no one knows it. BBK Electronics was similar to VW Group and GM – it owned owned many Chinese makers (Oppo, Vivo, OnePlus, Realme, Iqoo and others). BBK Electronics was world's largest, larger than Apple or Samsung for years. It is now dissolved and is officially not the sole owner, but the all the BBK Electronics brands remain alive and well. They are dominant in many countries around the world. Today, Chinese smartphone makers have more than 60% of global market share. That's dominance.

And that dominance is being acquired in industry after industry.

**Part 3 – China is now dominant in smartphones**

It's all China, apart apart from Apple and Samsung. The remaining non-Chinese makers are super-small, like Sony (Japan), Asus (Taiwan) or Micromax (India) which hold much less than 1% each. Other than Apple and Samsung, it's all China – Xiaomi, Motorola (owned by Chinese Lenovo), Oppo, ZTE, Vivo and so on. China dominates worldwide smartphone market.

**Part 4 – What was the Chinese playbook for smartphones?**

It was a collection of factors, most notably:

1. Large covert govt subsidies.
2. Drive for local supply chain.
3. IP theft on industrial scale.
4. Protectionism in the local market.

Points #1 and #2 were especially impactful. Government subsidies allowed Chinese makers to offer lower prices, win marketshare (at the expense of others) and stay afloat much longer than they would have without the subsidies. This created much larger local production and much stronger supply chain locally in China. Apple's CEO Tim Cook has admitted that strong supply chain makes China much more favourable production location than the USA. Now, even without the cost advantage, China is the most favourable place for smartphone manufacturing. The playbook worked. And they're repeating it elsewhere.

**Part 5 – Same playbook in EVs**

Note how quickly Chinese smartphone makers went from utter garbage to world-class products. It took about 10 years. From there, it did not take long until China became dominant in the world market.

Same playbook is being used in many industries. The playbook worked wonders in solar panels, where China absolutely dominates the global market. The same playbook is now in EVs. And network equipment. And medical consumables. And industrial chemicals. And home appliances. And so on.

If this post reaches any Western automaker by some chance, I could happily share more over PM. For legacy automakers, brace for impact. Smartphone market of 2010 is mostly a graveyard (e.g. Nokia, SonyEricsson, LG, Palm, Blackberry), coma-patients (e.g. Sony, HTC) or Chinese-owned companies (Motorola). This risks to repeat in automotive.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h9uc3a/chinas_domination_playbook_how_china_dominates/,126,2024-12-08 23:14:03,"

[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse); People in the US and Europe did everything to maintain high consumption at the lowest possible cost. China, however, was smart enough to turn this desire for excessive consumption against the consumers themselves.; am i missing the play here? what's your point?; Domination playbook: Government financed “private industry” does what it wants without regulation

Wow.  So deep.; I wouldn't say Huawei are barely visible outside of China, I was in the UAE recently. They are pretty popular there and fhe middle east in general; Blah blah blah.  Can’t compete gotta make excuses. trillions of dollar spent on war while they spent a fraction of that on supply chain and infrastructure.  What do you expect?; If your answer isn't ""protectionism, IP theft, and slave labor"" you're an idiot.; Well west was very happy to have that when China was making toys and plastic stuff. 
But now not so happy when they can make their own jet engines. 
Ok well...; China’s “industry domination playbook” has proven incredibly effective, as seen in smartphones, solar panels, and now EVs. With government subsidies, local supply chain control, and protectionism, they’ve rapidly moved from low-quality products to global dominance in multiple sectors.

The smartphone example shows how quickly legacy players like Nokia and Blackberry fell, replaced by Chinese brands leveraging scale, innovation, and subsidies. The same trajectory is unfolding in EVs, with Chinese manufacturers improving quality and scaling rapidly.

Western automakers and industries need to take this seriously. Without massive investment in innovation, supply chain diversification, and competitive strategies, they risk becoming the next victims of China’s relentless playbook.; Don’t invest in Chinese stocks; “Govt subsidies” 😂 bro thinks the Yuan grow on trees; Eh China's more fucked than the rest of us.; America let it happen; That’s a massive article for the real answer. 

Slave labour.; Puts on China it is.; Bros just shouting nonsense into the void; HEY HOMEY

IT’S ME, TONY; You claim that the Chinese government conducts ""massive hidden government subsidies"" without any evidence.


First of all, lowering business costs is part of the government's responsibility (look at Europe, they went through de-industrialisation after losing Russian gas).


Secondly, you have provided no evidence.


Again, any massive subsidy can't be permanent, and indiscriminate subsidies just result in companies constantly cheating the government for subsidies. Most countries in the world subsidise businesses, but how do you subsidise them to make them competitive? That's the key.


The core is always comprehensive competitiveness.; Solid take; The one industry they fail to dominate and are hopelessly behind is the semiconductor, which is arguably the most important one.; The west (white people as a civilization), preached one thing and practiced another. No Principles, just game theory based life style. China is now playing this same game with the West.; There’s a yin and yang

The yin of anti capitalism is, bloated financials stemming from governmental protectionism/favorable trade policy

The yang is, absence of corporate autonomy from governmental affairs/policy, and the resulting tariffs. 

China is uninvestable

Do not put any money into Chinese stocks.; There are Chinese smartphones?; When u fuck with a devil....get ready to be reamed ...; China is a crazy anti immigration, aging nation with youth who have no intention of having kids. Let’s see how that plays out in their plans for world domination; For EVs they just spent more on research due to decades of factory pollution making the already bad air from sandstorm even worse.; Slave labor is a hell of a drug; Your 4 points basically comes down to they stole it...if that's all it takes lol; Not hard to dominate a bunch of industries when you have a 1.4 billion slave labor… 

However, their dominance is solely the fault of Murican government (congress) that allowed our greedy ass corporations to put their greed / profits over country, its citizens, and allies around the world.; China's hosed. What is this nonsense.; There's still room for appetite. ; This. It's also blame American corps for taking the cheaper labor. Manufacturing jobs left the US decades ago, and much of it now resides in China/SEA.; Terrible for business long term, then again, no one accused communists of being smart; It was around 2 AM when I got your message, sorry that I didn't see it on time.

My point was that China has proven ability to dominate an industry within 5 years of making a competitive product. This is now happening in automotive (with consequences for automotive makers), home appliances (a bunch of publicly traded companies) and elsewhere.; Can’t forget slave wages, stealing IP, and protectionism. ; That was just typical west arrogance. If it’s not the west it doesn’t count as a place. Same for any Chinese success is theft and oppression, never about competence and efficiency.; Wait so china is prosperous again? The rhetoric has been for the last 2 years that china is on the brink of an epic economic collapse, now they’re suddenly taking over the world again ??? Peter zeihan sure is an asshat.; If those three were all that were needed, even Africa would have been prosperous; China also buys Iranian sanctioned oil for significantly cheaper that market rate.

Cheap fuel -> Low cost of energy + slaves + gov protectionism = significantly cheaper goods; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189); Your nonsense perfectly explained your ignorance. Can Americans be even less creative? Just because US dominated the industry by protectionism, IP theft and slave labor between WWI and WWII doesn’t mean others have to. Learn your bloody history and open your eyes.; Smartphones, photovoltaics, and EVs are all easy to copy technology.; Th OP is thinking long-term, u r thinking quarter by quarter and going by stock market index.; that's the excuse America goes to when they realize their unionized workforces are completely uncompetitive against other countries' workforces

China's salaries are laughably low compared to America, and SE Asia even more so; literally. you can’t have insane profit margins without exploiting people. the cost has to be cut somewhere.; In EVs, it's actually worse than slave labour; it's also the genocide labour of their Uyghurs in Xingang. They're forced into labour prisons while their families are held hostage/ransom. They process a ton of lithium and aluminum.     
     
Edit: the Chinese shills/trolls/bots are out flipping votes. It's wild Reddit hasn't controlled that shit yet.; Put your money in china you say?; The number of bots in this thread is fucking wild. 

Invest in Chinese companies guys!!!! They’re definitely not on the brink of financial collapse and massively underperforming American indexes!!!!!!; White people as a civilization 

wtf kinda dumb shit did you just write

All the white ppl fuckin chilln together now?

Need I point out the sides in the last 2 world wars?; Honestly I see it the exact same as you… how many sheer number of items are made in china and bought by us… preached one thing, and practiced another for sure. The cost cut is at human exploitation over there. We just don’t see it here and don’t think about it at all.; Then bet on China lol. It’s a paper tiger economically and a paper tiger as a country. It’s a hellhole that runs on slave labor. I would rather not given every indicator that chinas performance metrics are faux; Sarcasm? :); that's the excuse America goes to when they realize their unionized workforces are completely uncompetitive against other countries' workforces

China's salaries are laughably low compared to America, and SE Asia even more so; Look at how much richer the top 20 billionaires have gotten since COVID. Double if not triple in net worth and we're talking from a base of 50-100b. Heck Elon himself is close to 400b this year. Insane the amount of wealth greed has generated for them; Th OP is thinking long-term, u r thinking quarter by quarter and going by stock market index.; Sir just one more bite, it's wafer thin.; I don't think so. They became a 'world factory,' and now they are able to develop their own technology.

I don't live in the USA, but my car has ZERO parts from the USA. The same goes for my smartphone, video game, and so on.

It's terrible for the USA, not China.; hmmm okay sorry you're from europe; What is your point? Can you not read? 

This is an investing sub. Everyone knows history. ; pretty good for a developing third world country ; It’s collapsing. But, their ev industry is doing well. 

I think Chinese households’ net worth is 80% real estate, or something? What happens when that crashes? It’s also like 30% of the economy. ; But it’s already happening. What’s China’s GDP last year, and what was it 10 years ago? And how did the average home price fare in the last 3 years? Chinese-made solar panels dominating the world is no more impressive or threatening than Chinese-made socks dominating the world.; Except Africa is a continent, not a country with a solidified coherent policy towards their own companies.

And lack of infrastructure; Wait, so, capitalism, evolution, free markets, survival of the fittest again? Just like the west did in the 1600s? Humans haven't become more moral, just more informed?


Despite tariffs, weaponization of the US dollar?


Damn, who would've thought; > sanctioned oil

as it turns out sanctions are a two-way street and deprives the sanction-er of cheaper goods as well

that's the excuse America goes to when they realize their unionized workforces are completely uncompetitive against other countries' workforces

China's salaries are laughably low compared to America, and SE Asia even more so; No. We are very much thinking that by every metric China has Faux success. There are so many indicators that China is a tightrope act and they are barely balancing it.

Their main car export is to Russia, who has no domestic car productions to note as well as a high demand for cheaper, low quality vehicles. Following it are countries with high population but lower income averages.; Long term actually is the big problem China has; did you skip like half the post where OP was talking about subsidies?; In the future ai and robots; Don’t know why you’re being downvoted i have 20 sources and a collection of leaked Chinese gov docs that literally prove this.; People were poorer before Deng Xiaoping turned China into capitalism but with a lot more large state companies. If it's slave labor now what do you call it before China became a global manufacturer. In fact it's gotten too expensive to make clothes in China so more of it gets made in poorer countries like India or Vietnam today.; Sadly the US is also becoming a paper tiger. I just wish we have a better choice for government that's not controlled by a bunch of billionaires. Hopefully Trump doesn't extend his 4 year term somehow. He has promised a bunch of economic metrics that seem absurd but let's see what happens; Honestly no.  Unless you are just talking about manufacturing idk what brand is Chinese

Apple, Samsung are the only two I can legit say off the top of my head.  

Do you mean Huawei?; I don’t think America could get away with 11 million Uyghur slaves. Good try though!; You’re a Chinese bot; What technology did China develop?; Pissing off your costumers doesn’t seem like smart business long term. Besides, China copies, doesn’t innovate, so they’re not irreplaceable. Automation can significantly slow their economy. Automation runs on AI, an American invention.; What happens when the world factory moves to India and Vietnam; exactly. they might dominate some markets but that doesn't mean they dont have massive internal tensions; ok - so it seems we need coherent sensible policies as well. What else?; Protectionism isn’t free markets. The market is controlled by the government, it’s a dictatorship. It’s not the fittest who survive, it’s those who get government support. 

Slave labor, government aided IP theft, currency manipulation, huge tariffs… China is definitely not ‘capitalism, free markets, survival of the fittest’. ; Excuse?

Is it an excuse?

I’d say it’s a recognition of fact and reality; Not really. Why are we tariffing them then?; You are being downvoted into oblivion and will be attacked with false stats and whataboutism lol. Reddit is on its way to become infested by misinformation like YouTube comment section 😂; Dude subsidies alone do not make stuff materialise.; Share them pls; Lmao; I guess it depends on how trumps private prison industry plays out. We may be seeing these numbers surge in the next few years and reach hundreds of thousands if not million+ more than what we already have  in prison slave labors

What USians gonna do? Pay more for the products? Took off the production from China and start to produce in USA paying a higher salary? 


> China copies, doesn’t innovate

Something tells me that you know nothing about the world outside the USA. Car sales of US brands keep declining outside the USA, while Chinese brands continue to rise.

Your 'AI' can't even run without Chinese hardware supply.

Besides that, China's economy keeps growing every year, making its internal market HUGE, with over 1 billion people ready to spend money on Chinese products.; They are not just the world's factory anymore, they supply technology to the world. In my country, we have more Chinese car brands than American ones. All the electric cars are from Chinese brands.

And just think for a second: Who would make more money if India became rich (or less poor)? China or the West?; China moves on to competing in IP and design with Europe and US, exactly what’s happening now, US having to ban TikTok like China banning Google and YouTube before. What, you think the West has a god given right to the high value work?; fine then, neither is the US in 1600s to 1900s:

""In 1789, Congress passed a tariff act , imposing a 5% flat rate tariff on all imports. Between 1792 and the war with Britain in 1812, the average tariff level remained around 12.5%. In 1812, all tariffs were doubled to an average of 25%, in order to cope with the increase in public expenditure due to the war.

In 1816, a new law was introduced to keep the tariff level close to the wartime level—especially protected were cotton, woolen, and iron goods. The American industrial interests that had blossomed because of the tariff lobbied to keep it, and had it raised to 35 percent in 1816. The public approved, and by 1820, America's average tariff was up to 40 percent.

According to [Michael Lind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Lind), protectionism was America's de facto policy from the passage of the Tariff of 1816 to World War II, ""switching to free trade only in 1945.""

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectionism\_in\_the\_United\_States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectionism_in_the_United_States)

The US invented that shit. China's merely trying to perfect it for their own use cases. Don't forget your world history.

Use whatever holier-than-thou morals you want, but countries and peoples and systems are all like organisms. It's always survival of the fittest (Russia/Ukraine, Israel/Palestine, China/Taiwan).; Yeah it’s a really dumb excuse. They literally write those “slave labour” articles to clickbait brainlets. Don’t out yourself next time.; [deleted]; Because of product saturation. Pseudo Slave labor allows higher production numbers and cheaper production costs, meaning they can inflate the amount of production lines and exports.

They also have complete control of significant rare earth metals used in electronics which are, like usual, produced by pseudo slave labor. 

As for why we are tariffing them? That’s just the standard operation for a country that oversaturates the market for given products. Or, it could simply be the ideals of a party to cut competition. 

What’s the reason for tariffing Canada and Mexico? Is it because they’re economic goliaths that will surpass the U.S.? No. It’s because of people’s ideals.; For length and security reasons I can’t give all 20 sources here plus the docs themselves. BUT here are two very credible pieces written by an expert on the genocide, Adrian Zenz. These pieces contain the relevant parts of the leaked docs (the whole leaked package is in the sources) and verified photos of the internment facilities. The second source also covers forced sterilization, and the forcing of Uyghur women to marry Han men and have “Chinese” kids.

I do have some other first hand material leaked by Chinese soldiers but I apologize as I can not openly share this on such a public platform.; I guess it would also depend on if prisoners and slaves were the same thing.

https://www.google.com/search?q=are+prisoners+the+same+as+slaves; Hope you got your penny for the post; IDK, I wanted you to answer my question; Ohh you’re not even in the U.S., your viewpoint makes a lot more sense now, wish Reddit would add country flags next to profiles; lol you love China long time… didn’t even realize your are ex U.S. ✌️; Sorry that doesn’t compute. China has all the manufacturing. We’re just hurting ourselves… you can’t tariff IP; I’m sorry. What is this slave labor? You mean cheap manufacturing that the US outsourced? Btw, China is too expensive now because they took 800 million out of poverty. All the manufacturing is moving to Vietnam and India.; >very credible pieces written by an expert on the genocide, Adrian Zenz.

Literally CIA mouthpiece

>I do have some other first hand material leaked by Chinese soldiers but I apologize as I can not openly share this on such a public platform.

a literal CIA agent lmao



> I do have some other first hand material leaked by Chinese soldiers but I apologize as I can not openly share this on such a public platform

sure you do lmao, just like how ew all have secret proof of jewish space lasers but can't publicly share them for reasons; Can you share sources that are not from this guy ""Adrian Zenz""?; Thank you 🙏; hope you got a piece of the US State Department $1.6 billion propaganda fund!; Típicas USian. You can search if you want an awnser; I dont love China. You love China. I can live pretty well without an iPhone and a F150. 

USA and your desire for cheap product create China as an economical power.; CIA agent? Buddy not only is he a German, there’s no evidence of any CIA affiliation. 

What propaganda are you consuming? Did you read his reports? The Chinese government admitted the genocide themselves; How is a CIA agent German? You’re dreaming and inhaling the fumes of autocratic propaganda. 

As for the second part there’s nothing I can say. Believe what you want I don’t care. 

However, I would caution you from being antisemitic

PS. https://www.ushmm.org/genocide-prevention/countries/china/chinese-persecution-of-the-uyghurs; Genocide watch: https://www.genocidewatch.com/single-post/uyghurs-credible-case-china-carrying-out-genocide

United States Holocaust Museum: https://www.ushmm.org/genocide-prevention/countries/china/chinese-persecution-of-the-uyghurs

The genocide is also recognized by many countries around the world. Chinese gov documents also show the Chinese government intends to rid the region of Uyghurs and move in ethnic Han. 

US gov investigation into Uyghur genocide and fast fashion: https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/fast-fashion-and-the-uyghur-genocide-interim-findings.pdf

For example, with Japan invented: QR codes, digital microphones, and camera phones. What technology did China develop?; > Buddy not only is he a German

the guy is literally living in the US and working for organizations funded by US State Department propaganda efforts

> Did you read his reports? The Chinese government admitted

point me to the link

as if I will buy the fiction where Israel kills tens of thousands of children but isn't genocide, but somehow incarceration is?; > German?

he's currently living and working in the US for organizations funded by the US State Department's propaganda arms; The first 3 links are funded by US though. Genocide Watch I believe is funded by USAID. USHM is funded by US Holocaust Memorial Council which is funded by Congress. UK Parliament issued a motion not vote and was attended by only 23 of 650 MPs. A motion just means they can move forward to debate and then vote to decide if it's indeed a genocide or not.; Haha well I never thought you and I would be on the same side of an issue. But I actually agree with the Israel thing. I was trying to be diplomatic and link a source in case you were biased towards that side. I would agree with your point that Israeli funded media is not reliable. 

Here is the link to the full set of leaked documents. For more research you can look up “Xinjiang Papers”: 

https://xjdp.aspi.org.au/explainers/the-leaked-documents/

Another link to the docs: https://www.xinjiangpolicefiles.org

And a third for good measure (+ analysis from SH): https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/seas/news/xinjiang-papers-how-xi-jinping-commands-policy-peoples-republic-china

BBC also reported on these files: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-59456541.amp

As did the New York Times (Zionist funded so reader beware): https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/16/world/asia/china-xinjiang-documents.html

Do you have a link to prove he works for the CIA? Or do you just not trust him because he works somewhere that’s connected to the US State Department of Evil?; Germany and the US are allies. It is natural their citizens collaborate. Even so, disputing leaked Chinese gov documents by saying “he’s a CIA agent” is not good enough. 

Did you see the evidence and piece I linked from the Holocaust Memorial Museum?

Edit: also I looked up the CIA accusations. Could only find Chinese media sources that are controlled by the gov saying that. I have provided numerous sources. I am genuinely curious to see a credible source that says he is a CIA agent. I am not static, my mind is open. If there is credible information I would like to read and analyze; Ok let’s go bare bones. 

https://xinjiang.sppga.ubc.ca/chinese-sources/cadre-materials/informal-releases-of-cable-documents/

Screw all the sources and media. Read the documents yourself. Watch the videos yourself. The only bias will be your own. If you doubt UBC’s credibility we have nothing left to discuss here. It is not even remotely connected to America. It is one of the global bastions of scholarly integrity and thorough research. 

Edit: Browse this site. This is a link to the website but there’s all sorts of firsthand leaked material on there.; > admitted the genocide themselves

https://www.xinjiangpolicefiles.org/key-documents/

these documents simply show the mechanism for prison security and protocols, and as I've said mass incarceration is not genocide when you aren't killing the prisoners (otherwise US internment of Japanese-Americans and present-day US mass incarceration are somehow also genocides on par with Auschwitz gas chambers?); > Did you see the evidence and piece I linked from the Holocaust Memorial Museum?

your link doesn't have any evidence, only written text accusations

149,Portfolio Talk,"Hello all, after months of my own research I've made a portolio. I want to preface this by saying this is not a post looking for advice. I am just wanting to tell you all the investments I've made and the reasons behind them. Also, there is some overlap between my individual picks and my ETF picks. I know.

**First, the foundation**

Like any smart investor you need a solid base. Something that will grow steadily and won't make you want to sell out when there is an inevitable market crash. This is why for my first pie, I have gone with 80% VUAG and 20% IGLA.

**Tech Focus**

People may say that my portfolio is too heavily weighted towards the USA and tech, I think the tech giants like Apple etc are not going anywhere. So my allocations are as follows,

Amazon- Moving into the AI space with Nova, Revenue growing steadily YOY.

Microsoft- Almost in the 'too big to fail' category. Not going anywhere and an easy choice IMO.

Alphabet- Recovered well and quickly after 2022 crash. Massive AI player. Easy choice

Apple- Still most popular in the Phone space. Can only see this stock going one way.

Meta- Absolutely flying in recent years. Hopeful Zuck will keep it up.

ASML- Riskier pick but believe they will have a good year next year. Looking 4-5 years into the future with this one.

Nvidia- Don't think I need to say too much with this choice. Looking long term, very excited about this one.

IonQ- Main player in quantum computing space, looking at some volatile years upcoming but I have faith that they could be huge in 5+ years.

**Consumer Focus**

Costco wholesale- Almost unshakeable business model, no strong competition IMO.

Pets at home- Smaller allocation for this one. Seems undervalued to me as people are always going to treat their pets. Will keep tabs on this one as still unsure.

Procter and Gamble- Been around for a million years. Very stable with dividend growth YOY.

Walmart- Consumer powerhouse in USA, strong financials and IMO not going anywhere,#

**Finance Focus**

Berkshire Hathaway- Trust in Buffett, no pressure from short term market trends.

Intuit- Dividend growth YOY, in an incredible place financially.

JP Morgan and Chase- In the 'too big to fail' category in my opinion. Involved in so many industries so not dependent on one for revenue.

MasterCard- Very able to adapt to the market, only risk is inflation IMO.

PayPal- After share price crash in 2022. Revenues didn't faulter and net income bounced back within the year. Undervalued IMO.

S&P Global- Adapting well to new tech such as AI. Been around forever.

**Real Estate Focus**

Realty income- Unshaken by the market crashes in past 20 years. Dividend Growth YOY.

VICI properties- Predictable revenue due to triple net leases. In a strong financial postion.

I think I have a good mix of sectors and stability/growth. I am not looking for advice but will take onboard any criticism.

If this is in line with your strategy and what you want, your comfortability in that sector, go for it.

Since most of my capital comes from trading and that in and of itself can be draining mentally, I don’t want to think when it comes to investing. A simple SPY 60% / 25% SCHD / 15% other stocks I pick work for me.  (I chose spy since I like selling covered calls); Which Berk? Baby Berk?

Just as important is proper asset allocation and using a trailing stop, or knowing your exit before you buy. I use 4% asset allocation with a 25% trailing stop.; I understand your view. I am just very interested in investing and love a more hands on approach rather than the ‘set it and forget it’ thought process."

Not to be harsh or anything but imo something not going anywhere is not a thesis + where you buy something does matter. You've had an amazing run for tech, if you're going to make at least a medium term case for what brings a material amount of additional buyers from here, what is considerably underappreciated about these businesses at this point?

COST is a fantastic business, but getting up to around the valuation it had in the dot com period. You can see how it did in the decade or so after. WMT is not cheap vs history either but it is admittedly winning over TGT for the time being.

""Realty Income""

It's not a bad company but imo there are too many people on Reddit who buy this because they think they need yield and then rather buy something where they have a thesis about the company itself (and that company happens to pay a nice dividend) they buy this. If someone is retired or near-retired, fine - but too many people in their 20's/30's owning this.

IMO, people have elevated the idea of dividends too much.

This is not a bad portfolio, but I think you have to have more reasoning behind some of these choices and a lot of these names have been on quite a run/feel varying degrees of crowded - reasoning imo becomes more important when you're trying to justify why something like NVDA can continue in the manner it has been or why AAPL can sustain this multiple.; Are these all just the top companies with the safest bet that they will continue to grow?; I ain't reading all that.

* You drop your phone under a tire because you were to busy while parking, leading to a smashing of both it and the SIM card. The only fix is you buy a new phone, login with your iCloud email, and everything is restored from the cloud.
* Rubrik does the above and sells at-cost servers from partners like Dell, HPE, SMCI, etc. They protect data in places like AWS , Azure, and GCP.
* People pay whatever when they have no phone or car. Same here.

Given Rubrik's recent performance and market position, here are a few option strategies you might consider:

1. \*\*Long Call\*\*: If you're bullish on Rubrik and expect the stock price to rise, you could buy a call option. For example, you could buy a call option with a strike price of $60, expiring in January 2025. This allows you to profit from any significant upward movement in the stock price.
2. \*\*Covered Call\*\*: If you already own Rubrik shares and want to generate additional income, you could sell a call option against your shares. For instance, you could sell a call option with a strike price of $70, expiring in April 2025. This strategy allows you to earn premium income while potentially selling your shares at a higher price.
3. \*\*Bull Call Spread\*\*: If you want to limit your risk while still benefiting from a potential rise in Rubrik's stock price, you could consider a bull call spread. This involves buying a call option with a lower strike price (e.g., $60) and selling a call option with a higher strike price (e.g., $70), both expiring in July 2025. This strategy limits your maximum profit but also reduces your initial investment.
4. \*\*Protective Put\*\*: If you own Rubrik shares and want to protect against a potential decline in the stock price, you could buy a put option. For example, you could buy a put option with a strike price of $50, expiring in January 2026. This strategy provides downside protection while allowing you to benefit from any upside in the stock price.
5. \*\*Straddle\*\*: If you expect significant volatility in Rubrik's stock price but are unsure of the direction, you could consider a straddle. This involves buying both a call option and a put option with the same strike price (e.g., $60) and expiration date (e.g., January 2025). This strategy allows you to profit from large price movements in either direction.

154,My thesis on INTC going into 2025,"I am going to add my technological and geopolitical fundamentals here, because I think these are going to be important factors heading into 2025. Disclaimer: I own 575 shares of Intel at an average PpS of $29.30

I think most analysts are forgetting that the next president is the same guy who is trying to block the acquisition of US steel by Nippon steel at all costs, regardless if it makes financial sense or not because he wants to retain as much American Manufacturing as possible and wants it to succeed.

Most of the ""AI revolution"" has happened over the past 4 years where the administration had no problem letting foreign chip manufacturing take the lead. Intel is competing with TSMC, and TSMC receives massive subsidies and discounts from the Taiwanese government which dwarf the 7.9B (which was even reduced) from the US government. On top of that, the US government is also giving slightly less in subsidies, 6.6B, to TSMC to build in the US. So really, the current administration is not giving Intel an advantage over TSMC. The most effective thing that they could do is levy tariffs against Taiwan, which the next president has gone on record stating he wishes to do, instead of subsidies. This would increase demand for American chip manufacturing; while TSMC can manufacture in the US, CoWoS packaging is done outside of the US, in either Malaysia or Taiwan, and would cause the product to be subject to tariffs.

In the chip design space, Intel is hopelessly behind on GPUs compared to Nvidia, and now Apple, Amazon, OpenAI and others are designing their own chips and using TSMC for manufacture. Intel still dominates the CPU space, but your average datacenter rack might have 10/20+ GPUs for each CPU. AMD is also a viable alternative to Intel for CPUs, and as such takes about 25% of the market. Intel's only way to compete in the GPU space is in the cost performance market, which mainly targets budget gaming, crypto mining, and cheap datacenter. The newest release of the ""Battlemage"" B580 is expected to compete with Nvidia's 4060 at the under $300 MSRP market, which are lofty goals. Nvidia and AMD still have offerings in these spaces but they are not lucrative ones. So Intel is basically competing to be a 3rd rate designer in the US, while they still have the CPU lead it matters a lot less for the lucrative markets right now.

It's clear that on the design front, Intel is not going to receive much help to be successful. While this is their core business and majority of revenue, it is a business they are falling behind substantially compared to others. Design demand is GPUs and they are late to this party. Revenue for products is expected to stagnate or decline unless they have a competitive GPU offering.

However, the US needs to have a domestic cutting edge chip manufacturing supply chain. It has expressed as much as a result of the 2022 supply chain shortage when we realized that letting TSMC manufacture 90% of the world's sub 5nm chips was a bad idea. That was the motivation behind passing the CHIPS act; Pat Gelsinger was instrumental in advising the current administration for this. The method for doing so has left a lot to be desired; Pat himself even expressed as much given the delay in fund disbursement, which in all fairness was only accelerated as a result of the election result and comments from republicans that they wanted to repeal the act.

TSMC is not allowed to have the latest node fabricated in the US by law of the Taiwanese government. This is so that the country keeps its ""Silicon Shield"", the dependence globally to have manufacturing be done there which keeps Taiwan protected from China. But Intel has no such limitation. And TSMC is not able to fufill 100% of the orders for its customers; it is aggressively building more fabs to keep up with the ever increasing demand of AI. This demand exists for Intel to take part of.

So, Intel in the next administration will have a tremendous amount of support for its Foundry, not Products, side of the business. This leaves Intel with a potential alternative to many of the scenarios analysts predict: It could solely dedicate to Foundry and sell off its Products division, most likely to AMD which shares the x86 architecture already and is solely focused on design. This would allow Intel to become a Foundry for external customers without having a conflict of interest, which I suspect is keeping them from customers. The CHIPS act stipulates that Intel has to retain a majority stake of Foundry but NOT Products, so this does not prevent Intel from dedicating itself to Foundry, which is what the US wants.

I think Pat was waiting for the right climate to do this and it is coming soon. It is sad he did not stay long enough to see it happen. If Intel received the same amount of support from the US government that the Taiwanese government gave to TSMC, and was able to win external customers as a result of Tariffs, it could become the US TSMC. Much of this hinges on the 18A and later 14A nodes which are competitive with TSMC 2nm, which is the current cutting edge. But I think this is the desire of Intel and the next administration, and so they will work towards this goal. To diminish foundry would be a slow death for Intel. That is why I am still looking forward to Intel in 2025.

If you got this far, thank you for reading.

EDIT: Now that I think about it, it is also entirely possible for Qualcomm to buy Intel's Products division. I think they expressed as much earlier this year, but being they are primarily ARM I am not sure if it would be a good fit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h8n76e/my_thesis_on_intc_going_into_2025/,142,2024-12-07 08:17:11,"#**TLDR**

**Ticker:** INTC

**Direction:** Up

**Prognosis:** Bullish on INTC for 2025, due to potential shift to foundry business model and anticipated government support under new administration.  OP believes INTC could become the ""US TSMC"".

**Hopium Level:** High. OP owns 575 shares.

**Key Argument:**  Current geopolitical climate favors domestic chip manufacturing. OP believes the next administration will support INTC's foundry business through tariffs and other measures, potentially leading to INTC spinning off its product division (maybe to AMD?!) and becoming a pure-play foundry.; [deleted]; https://preview.redd.it/p56dx4qwqd5e1.png?width=751&format=png&auto=webp&s=761250fe824095a1a3673c14f50865705ae50061; I agree with the Rah Rah US Manufacturing argument and have 100 x $75c expiring in Jan'26 as a bet on that.

No, I don't think it will get that high; its a volatility play. If we get to June and nothing has happened to move the share price up, I'll just dump the options.

I don't believe in Intel enough to bet big. I just believe some stupid government-related crap will happen to run it up a good chunk in a quick burst over the first half of next year.; Intel has shit for company culture, gives shitty pay and have shitty morale. Talents dont want to stay long term and management is incompetent. A company like this is simply not capable of executing what's needed. All the external influences, public or private, are just noise. The fact of the matter is Intel in its current state is a shit company and should be treated as such until strong evidence to the contrary.; # Good view!~~~ I think it's bottom now.

# I have 8500 shares at $20.98. And $100000 for 18 CALL, expire Dec18'26, waiting for the next year!!!; In for 1000 shares at $20.87. May nana’s blessings be in our favour.; Their foundry business no longer looks promising, they just canned the guy that was trying to get them to the same playing field as TSMC.

The best hope INTC can have is someone like QCOM buying them out, any other way for them seems like a slow death.; Im in only on bullshit astrology pattern recognition. Intc seems to bottom at 19 to 20 then after a few months pops to 25 before falling. In that time I can sell a ton of calls and make a modest 5% gain on top of selling at 25. Fuck it im in half my port lets go; Also any instability in the Taiwan strait would be good for Intel as grim as that is; even Nana would not fall for this shit again ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); U might want to add the fact that they are thinking about getting a new CEO. Anytime a big company gets a new CEO, company gets a clean slate and if he or she that comes aboard was successful prior, will bring some following with them and $$ as well; INTC does not have CPU technical leadership and it's not only about the process (their newest desktop stuff is inferior to AMD, even when both companies are using TSMC). They may still cling to a significant market share thanks to their shady lock-in sales tactics (as well as AMD's inability to manufacture enough CPUs for the server market), but that's not going to last forever.; Good analysis. Pat’s time as CEO was largely focused on the foundry business. There he made tremendous strides and as long as things follow through and intel executes with its foundry business, it could turn out very well. 

A lot of intels failings in the client market with raptor lake, arrow lake, and arc are a score spot. However, the average consumer has no clue about any of it. Most laptops still run Intel chips and most consumers are of the mindset, “core i7 good”, regardless of the fact that sku has a U suffix. They also still hold a strong lead in server due to a lot of that same legacy mind share. Really intels “mind share” has really only been demolished in the enthusiast space where people are privy to how shit intels products are compared to amd when it comes to power efficiency and value. 

I don’t see how Intel can catch up when it comes to product. They need a totally clean sheet for desktop on the cpu. I’m not holding my breath. 

AMD and TSMC have a partnership which has yielded significant advancements when it comes to advanced packaging. Things like Mi300 and 9800x3D are products that come to mind. Intel doesn’t have any real answer to this right now. If their foundry business is to succeed in the future they need to prove they can do these things at the same cost and scale as TSMC. Advanced packaging and chiplets are one of the next big things required to remain competitive in the space. Advanced packaging is essential for Intel foundry. 

Word is that Intel is in talks with some companies about a potential sale of parts of its business. Chances are they are gonna put in a ceo well atunes to that role. Whatever happens is anyone’s guess. A lot of names are being thrown around in regard to who may be buying part of the business. 

I’m holding my stock. Maybe I’ll break even one day.; Intel selling off CCG is suicidal, that's the only profitable part of the business!

Intel's big bet on 18A will likely succeed from a tech perspective. Pat said their BSPD is ahead of TSMC, and a former Samsung Foundry (now Intel employee) said Intel's GAA implementation is better than anyone else in the industry. They've poured billions into it, it'd better f\*cking work lol.

The problem is whether they can be a true foundry - have a robust process that can cater to the needs of different customer demands: desktop, datacenter, mobile, etc. They've only ever fabbed their own chips up to this point, and have just released their first ever PDK a few months ago. Would be nice to poach some experienced TSMC guys for this if possible.; > I think most analysts are forgetting that the next president is the same guy who is trying to block the acquisition of US steel by Nippon steel at all costs, regardless if it makes financial sense or not because he wants to retain as much American Manufacturing as possible and wants it to succeed.

I think this is a flawed assumption.  What he favors (historically) depends on who lines his pocket the most.  It would be wise to model the outcome with this possibility.; I came here because someone at yahoo finance turned your post into their own article lol ; NVDA is going to throw them a bone, or else QCOM is going to buy them; Buying Intel now is no bad idea; I just want a new CEO to be appointed for my calls to print.; Intel is prob the most rational valuation in the chips industry.. unfortunately, I believe the rest of the industry is extremely overvalued based on future growth... so ya.. Best to wait until intel actually does something good; $60 in 4 years is well within the realm. Like AMD, Intel will never go under or allowed to be bought out by a non-American company.

$20 will be our generational low.; I have over 83k worth of calls for late 2025 and early 2026. I don’t know anything. I’ve done very little dd. I’m trading mostly on vibes. What I’ve seen is Intel at $2 less then is being considered for buy out by every major player. So you’re telling me I can load up on shares or calls at $20.50 and if it goes down I get buy out rumors and all other news either is positive or putting me in buy out rumors range? Fuck it. Lock it in it’s a win for a trader about 95% guaranteed at this point. Happy to listen to as many people say it’s a boomer company with a shit culture and behind every company it competes with.; Intel was leader in the CPU market and still did shit as a stock. Now they are behind AMD. What do you think the stock will do? If its product does not get better, it is about to share the fate of Nokia and Yahoo. Once leaders, then losers.; The selling on Thursday looked like capitulation selling to me. I waited for the retest of those lows on Friday, they held, and I bought. I don’t know if this is the bottom, but the risk reward right now is very good. If I’m wrong I risk like 30 bucks for the relatively large position I took on Friday. It did close green on Friday, but there wasn’t a really hard bounce. So it’s possible sellers are still aggressive enough to drive it lower and keep it down there. We will see.; Thanks for your thoughtful analysis! I’m hopeful for a turnaround, too (10 6/26 45c.); If you like throwing good money after bad, just send it to me instead.; Bro wakes up every morning to spread misinformation; 😂 intc bag holder spotted.

[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse); I think the board tried to shop Intel with how they handled CEO replacement. Todays price was flat indicating fair value; Intel probably won't disappear.

But not sure if they regain their dominance that soon or ever again.

Maybe top 10.

But now you have other fabless chip design companies ahead using TSMC and Samsung.

MRVL, QCOM, ARM, AVGO, AMD, NXPI, etc.

Maybe they will be like TXN, UMC and GF.; It is a shit company and nothing will change it! They lost all their advantage and now all they can do is line up their execs behind a wendy’s; You're a bagholder though....; It worries me that investor sentiment seems to be that Intel still has the lead on CPUs, because it means that AMD's crushing lead in the CPU space still somehow isn't priced in.; No way I'd buy Intel again.

also me:

    That the Dog returns to his Vomit and the Sow returns to her Mire, 
    And the burnt Fool's bandaged finger goes wabbling back to the Fire;; TL;DL

INTC is gg.  Nothing inside Intel.; Sir, this is a Wendy's; [deleted]; Memaw watching from above.....; Nice try grandma; Shrinking revenue and lower margins than competitors. Hard pass.; Intel sub $9 by june 2025; Ya’ll need to understand other tickers exist, you don’t need to all bet on the same ones…; Products need not be a dead end. Instead, they may require some cultural changes, like taking a more ""synthesis"" approach to tile, increasing the lifetime of sockets, etc.


Intel should have higher value running design-manufacturing duo, perhaps it can let foundry customers use some of its design too. E.g. Intel maintains a core focus on fast and efficient serial computes, but takes collaborative approaches on accelerators/parallel computes; Nana hopes you’re right.; So. Many. Words. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); This company gonna collapse, stop false hoping; Intels A18 yields are shit. So, no.; Please please please just buy $amd pleaseeeeeeeeeee $intc is sooooo garbage pleaeeeeeeee just listen, you know nothing and I want you to keep your money, get $amd pleaseeeeee, I’ll even hold your hand and buy it with you on Monday, I want to get the 2/21/25 150 call, will you buy just one for me 🥹; Didn't even read, just scrolled down to see nana; I am awaiting his post on December 8th.; “Papa’s home”; Fair move.; This is why I'm in Intel too, but maybe I'm a bit too early. I started buying LEAPS 45calls for June 2025 back in June of this year at an average cost of $0.51...and in September I bought a couple of August 2025 25 calls at $3.90 so I'm underwater on both at the moment.

I think the government won't let them fail, but I'm no longer convinced that the stock will move much. I was thinking that it would take just a bit of good news to push the stock, but it doesn't go up much on good news and the bad news keep piling up.

Probably won't add to this position until I see some sustained positive price action and might need to roll my 45c.; WTH $75?  Oh I forgot what subreddit I'm in.  Re.Tart.; Intel essentially needs a reason to exist.; Is the exit of Gelsinger a turning point moment?  Will it be like when Ballmer left Microsoft in favor of Satya Nadella?  Satya pivoted hard to cloud and changed the culture. 

Maybe the new INTC boss will pivot hard to Foundry and change the culture, resulting in a rebirth of growth in INTC similar to what MSFT enjoyed.; If I had that much, I'd be that much in too. I have 21 $35 Calls for Jan 2026, about $5000 of cost basis there. And I want to load up on more shares, so I got a bunch of calls going into next year. Intel currently represents about 60% of my portfolio, which is pretty much all the income I've made in late 2023 through 2024.; !remindme 2 years; Guess 20 was not the bottom ; What's with people thinking companies can buy INTC? Yes the market cap is low and looks attractive but the reality is Intel would be very very expensive to own.  North of $500bn guaranteed considering they have $200bn of assets alone.; Are you referring to the recent 10% yield article? That's been debunked.; Any instability in that regard would be bad for the entire set of chip stocks though; I don’t think it’ll get that bad. Losing Taiwan to China would be a complete blow to his administration.; Why would China do this? There is very little to gain from this, but a lot to lose.; Intel depends on TSMC to make its chips lol; They are scouting high level NVDIA executives.; Our AI tracks our most intelligent users.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*; It is also possible through some combination of tariffs and costs that Intel can achieve parity. After all, that's really the point of tariffs, not to collect revenue but to change behavior.; Well it's the only profitable part so far. But as TSMC is proof of, you can just do foundry, you don't need to have design. And if there is a demand for an American Cutting Edge Foundry, Intel is the only one that could fill that spot. This is what people are not understanding, the 2025 landscape is going to change in many ways.; I saw, and they changed a lot of the wording. Just to be clear, Intel is only still relevant because they have the majority market share in CPUs, that is almost 54% of revenue.; Nvidia makes AI datacenters, not video game GPUs. It's a paradigm shift.

Intel can barely make a CPU today, their actual bread and butter; And what will happen to the stock if they buy them?; Going to bonertown baby brother.; This. I can't picture buying the top on anything right now.; It can retest 18.50 if the situation is not under control. But past that? Doubt it, now you're trying to devalue assets.; What part of this is misinformation? I have presented the facts which the market knows.; Xeon 6 uses Intel 3 (3nm). Intel's 18A is 2025.; OP knows nothing shit

>It could solely dedicate to Foundry and sell off its Products division

[Semiwiki ](https://semiwiki.com/forum/index.php?forums/semiwiki-main-forum-ask-the-experts.2/)is where anyone who is considering BTFD should go to, not here; what happens behind a wendys?; Exactly, ditch products and make them for other designers. Pure play foundry worked for TSMC.; I think the latter can work if they can rehabilitate their reputation. If they can't, products is what's holding back foundry, unless they can split.; Debunked article; I hope to read nana's thesis; What we have here is a failure to recognize a paradigm shift. The only reason we don't have human clones is Bill Clinton said no, but now that the oligarchs are transitioning to power, the need for Total Control should be apparent to the even the most casual observer. Once you get past the moral queasiness, one can see the human clones connecting to the internet via optical nerve implants and fingertips ... it will be just like printing money ... data centers become king ... chips stagnant at the phone screen; Unlike any other company, Intel failing is potentially the reason we will have to fight China in the coming years. So yeah, there is big incentive to keep them alive.; I was thinking government wasnt gonna let Spirit airlines fail but look where that lead them…; I read it as 75 cents. It made sense to me.; I am a former investor in Intel and some of my past colleagues work at Intel. I wanted Intel to happen, I really did. Don't tunnel vision into this single stock.; Problem is unlike Microsoft and whoever, foundries cannot be pivoted that easily it's a process that takes years.

|-|-|-|-|; Added 3000 shares today!\~; That 10% yield article is a rehash of an old article from a long time ago. It was 10% then, we don't have the latest yield numbers but it is pretty much guaranteed to be way higher than that.

Having said that, yield percentage comparison is not a proper way of measurement. The real comparison is defect density; idk about “debunked” so much as “disregarded” because of potential conflict of interest. 

but i think he was just referring to how bad a sign firing pat is for IFS. made me sell — just cannot fathom how that was the right play unless 1) 18A is going to shit behind the scenes 2) pat is sick or something; That would make the stock move.; Lmao; True. They still need to remain competitive though. People will probably pay more if the product is superior. That’s why it’s important the foundry follows through and continues advancing nodes and packaging.; Yes you do need design, Intel's CCG business still does more revenue than all of QCOM combined. By itself, ignoring foundry losses, it's probably worth $50-60/share.

TSMC has had years and years of experience being a pure foundry. Intel has not, so even if the 18A node itself is successful from a technical perspective, they have yet to prove it can meet the needs of external customers. 

It is the right strategy to have a foundry in the US, but Intel's execution has been poor for years. They would need to execute on Foundry better than they've ever done before, while maintaining CCG profits, to have the runway needed for this turnaround play.; Intel just sold like $150 million worth of CPUs for XAI’s new data center; They make datacenters now? I guess that RTX 4070 I bought last year was made by AMD then...; Intel appears to be competing against Apple’s ARM Silicon chips since Apple is primarily an OS company but that’s as far as they go.; 18.50 was the lows from the earnings dump? Hmmm I might have fucked this up.; Whatever buyer or spin off entity would be using the fab. The trapped customer is still there.; Reputation is very important. Intel Graphics products are actually quite good.
See if they can work out reasonable Arrow Lake fixes with partners; I also wouldn't say that rehabilitation is needed. They need to deliver the innovation and quality of products similar to or better than early Core era 


I.e. Everything can be done can be outdone ; Sir, this is a Wendy’s.; I am not swinging on the intel trade until I see a clear path to a competently high yield production of 18a.; Even though I am also bullish on Intel long term, you have to bear in mind that a government takeover/bailout can mean shareholders being wiped out. When GM got bailed out by the government, the stock went to zero, and shareholders lost their equity completely. Government incentive to keep a company alive is not always a plus for investors.; Why did you think they wouldn't let a discount airline fail? Boeing, on the other hand, they won't let fail either which is why I'm in Boeing too. Up on shares, down on options though ![img](emote|t5_2th52|18630); lol  more accurate? lol; I think the old Intel would never happen. It has to be a new Intel. They've already ditched the dividend, reduced headcount. The leadership is the issue. The tech is definitely there.; It’s been debunked. Pat Gelsinger himself responded to it on Twitter; It's just useless without talking about size as well. I can say for a fact TSMC has a 10% yield as well. Because at a big enough die size TSMC fabs will have a 90% defect rate.


It's really easy to make the fab sound bad to the people who have little idea of what's actually going on.; Yeah my assumption is that they stick to the foundry roadmap. I'm not expecting 18A to be perfect but I think given that it is smaller than 2nm, it can end up being more effective even if yields are lower. On packaging, I believe Intel has a site in New Mexico but also plants elsewhere, Malaysia too I think.; Missing the point. CPUs are a component. Nvidia is the one selling the entire system that works together that is the paradigm shift.

The CPU, GPU, NvLink, HBM etc. ofc there are many players involved but it's an Nvidia product at the end of the day. They make the sale.; It was the low when it redipped in September.; Rehabilitation of the image that Intel has had for the past decade or so.; Because the blocked the jet blue merger. Which set up up to file bankruptcy frontier was there only hope and that didn’t go anywhere… rip saveq it’s actually going back up tho surprisingly; ""The tech is definitely there.""

lold; … yeah it’s likely gonna go lower then. Oooops; I would say it’s about honestly recognizing mistakes, learning , and moving on; Yeah, sure...they essentially forced Spirit into bankruptcy but I don't see how any of those airlines are important enough to the US government to be worth saving.; Are they not one of the few companies who can actually manufacture below 3nm?; While I don’t see INTC filing bankruptcy I don’t see government leaning towards INTc just based off
”American made”  SMCI and Nvidia are already setting up shop here in USA…; Thats to be seen whether they can actually manufacture below 3nm...

I predict another ""unforseen"" incident that delays it or causes it to fail.

Why would CEO ""resign"" if hes doing such a stand up job. Afterall, moving towards fabbing was his idea..."
155,"COVID as a Mini ""Lost Decade""","By overlaying earnings and market cap we can get a pretty rough story of what happened with COVID and money printing and interest rate hikes and what this means for the future.

This image below is a bunch of large companies that represent the SPY. The colored areas are their earnings (with their predicted earnings in a lighter shade) and the black line is their combined market cap (price).

[https://imgur.com/a/GoOoF02](https://imgur.com/a/GoOoF02)  
I've annotated a few arrows to explain what seems to have roughly happened.

**Orange Arrow 2020 - 2022:** Interest rates drop which causes excess liquidity to flood the market. Those who already had assets saw huge portfolio increases. This new wealth combined with low interest caused a housing price boom. New money in the hands of retail caused cults to form around memes like GME. Plus no one wants to work and is wfh.

**Red Arrow 2022:** A ""lost decade"" is a period of time where new investors have no access to good investments. People who just started working in 2022 or decided to start investing in 2022 had no good place to put their money and would only have broken even in 2024. (the horizontal dash). In a larger crisis like with Japan's lost decade(s) you have 10-20 years where the stock market effectively grinds sideways. 

**Red & Orange**

[https://imgur.com/a/FD8zYAb](https://imgur.com/a/FD8zYAb)

If you overlay the SPY with the Fed's interest rate policy you can see that it looks to have caused some temporary price distress but long term the price is correlated with earnings, not interest rate.  A ""lost decade"" is effectively exuberance that ""pulls forward"" price appreciation and ""steals"" it from future investors. 

In the COVID response, those who had assets in 2020 benefited while those who started investing in 2022 had a difficult time b/c they didn't have access to the exponential growth of markets.

**Blue Line**

Long term investors who think in decades and don't actually need large purchases like cars or weddings (like old people...) can just ignore these bumps and focus on long term earnings.

\---

The above is obviously over-simplified but it's an example of how using earnings and price in tandem allows you to see the underlying story behind price movement.

If you just focus on price, all you can do is draw a line up and the right and say things that are true like ""AAPL is a good company""

[https://imgur.com/a/5L07X9p](https://imgur.com/a/5L07X9p)

You have no perspective.

The worst example is someone who got scared of investing in stocks in 2020 but seeing everyone around him get rich for 2 years he decides to start investing in 2022 and loses money for two years and decides to stop and then starts watching everyone around him make more money... in a never-ending spiral of 2 year delayed FOMO.

It's like relying on a tourist pamphlet in a foreign city. If you can't make a judgement of quality independently then you will always pay high prices and wait in long lines.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h8fr0c/covid_as_a_mini_lost_decade/,0,2024-12-07 01:10:51,
156,Roth vs Trad Vanguard / Confirmation,"Hey everyone. Yet another Traditional vs Roth question so thanks for bearing with me. I believe I received conflicting info from the Vanguard rep over the phone earlier in the year and, even after reading link after link, I want to get clarification since I missed one pivotal piece. 

Background:
Household makes 250k a year
Have a Roth Account.
Have a Traditional IRA. 
Contribute 7k+ per year into a Traditional IRA and then convert that to a Roth each year (?) 

My question:
Vanguard told me to contribute each month to my Traditional Ira and then at the start of the year I “convert it” to my Roth IRA. Is that right? That’s not the Backdoor Roth but does that matter?

Also, if I contribute more than the 7k in the traditional IRA, I can only “convert” 7k of that to the Roth, and leave any overage in the Traditional with the stocks I have set?

Apologies for redundancy but I would like to be set I won’t have any IRS surprises in the future. 

Thanks all. 
",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h8c3dd/roth_vs_trad_vanguard_confirmation/,1,2024-12-06 22:21:22,"I think what you are describing is back door Roth IRA conversion . Since your income is over the limit of 130k single ( approximately ) you have to do “ backdoor Roth IRA “ conversion . It’s just a strange odd thing we have to do . Unlike  a regular person who makes let’s say 50 k a year , who can just contribute 7000 directly into their Roth IRA , us the “ rich” people have to go through the “ back door” … so you have to contribute 7000 to Traditional Ira , wait a day or 2 fir it to settle , then click on  that account again and say “ convert to Roth IRA” . It’s looks and feels kind of stupid I think , but that’s the rules lol .; You can't contribute more than 7k into an IRA unless you are over 50, in which case you can contribute 8k per year. You cannot leave any excess contributions in any IRA if you have reached the limit, otherwise you will be forced to take it out.; You don't have to contribute over months. Most people contribute and convert all within the first week of January. If you're doing it for the first time then just max it out today.; Also , once you have your Roth IRA ( it just basically a set up that allows you to not pay tax on whatever that money grows into ) you buy whatever you want in it . Individual stocks, bonds , index funds , etc; Thank you. That’s good to know in general as it’ll probably kick back the funds. What account would I be able to open to freely contribute to and invest in let’s say VOO or SCHD? A standard brokerage?; Personal standard brokerage account, but you don't have any tax deferral or prepay advantages with that.

Max out tax advantaged accounts first like IRA/401k as you currently are, with a priority on ROTH, and anything above the annual limit that's still investable, you can go into personal standard brokerage or non-qualified account types."
157,Keep AAPL or pay federal student loans?,"I’ve held a decent chunk apple since 2018, and it’s enough to cover my student loans from this year that accrue at 9% interest (insane, I understand.) 
is there merit to continuing to hold apple? I’m not sure if I believe that apple will continue to outperform the 9% at which my loans accrue interest. Any input would be appreciated!

I would probably bite the bullet and pay off the loan, especially after this banner year of market performance.; At 9% id sell and pay down the debt.  Guaranteed 9% return is hella solid and you free up cash flow for more investment; I'd pay off the loans.  Guaranteed 9% return is not to be sneered at. Especially with current market valuations.; Pay off the loan and then DCA back into AAPL with however much you were paying on your loan; Pay off the loans. Today.; Absolutely pay off 9% loans; psychologically, it will help you tremendously to pay off all debts.  I would prioritize paying debts first.  

even if you are not bothered by it right now, having debts will give you second thoughts about making other large purchases.; ""I’ve held a decent chunk apple since 2018"" I can see you have faith in AAPL. Paying off student loan wont disappoint you.; Always pay down your debt. Debt interest compounds against you and nothing is more powerful than compound interest. Why would you want it working against you?; You get apples current premium valuation plus 9% on top, yeah I'd cash it; at 9% interest it would likely be worth it to pay it off. I wouldn't let go of AAPL fully tho; I sold some of my appl at $233 to pay down my %7.785 mortgage.. rest I reshift to high beta stocks. And I don’t regret it at all. 

I also bought my iphone 16 pro at the store and the traffic isn’t too great. I think apple will have some growth plateau and it’s worth the sale; How much of your portfolio is in apps and how much gains do you have embedded in it?

At a general level you want to be aware of the tax costs to selling. It often can make more sense to sell shares in things you recently bought over selling shares in long term holdings that will generate a big tax hit.; I just don’t understand why AAPL should be trading at 30+ forward P/E with very modest earnings growth…can someone help me?; Could also consider diversifying, you don't really need to keep just apple, nor pay off all debt at once.; +1, and the emotional relief of not having debt is a great added bonus, especially with constant waves of layoffs right now; This is kind of my general thought as well. The market did so well that I may as well take advantage of it, but AAPL will always be valuable. 

To the others’ point, the debt going away would be comforting to say the least.; I completely agree. Right now, I'd probably feel safe sitting on loans in the 4-6% area, but 9 is just wild. Definitely focus on paying the loans down first.; Right. 9% is crazy, sadly.; It’s about 10% of my portfolio and sitting around 200% gain.; Why is Costco at PE of 60??; Also, paying loans is tax free. Stocks not so much.; If it's 10% of your portfolio, do you have any losers you can sell? Get the tax benefit of a capital loss this time of year, and free up some cash to pay the loan.; Do you have any other holdings held at a loss or only minor gain? I personally would only sell holdings with a 200% gain if they were a massive over-allocation or I really needed the money and there was no alternative. Given apple's size, 10% is not a crazy overweight. 

Another thing to consider ifs what the specific tax cost would be. If you are in a low tax state, it would be easier to justify than if you were in CA for example.; Why do stocks have any value at all, especially ones without dividends?  All perception I suppose.; This is a good idea. I’ll take a closer look at some of my worse performing picks."

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

USA Unemployment Rate For November 4.2% Vs 4.2% Est.; 4.1% Prior; AMD just getting constantly shit on, lovely; UNH assassin must be in timbuktu by now; I hate how with investing some things are just so obvious in hindsight. Like why did I not full port into TSLA and PLTR the day after Trump won? It seems like the most obvious trade in the world now. They went up big and I thought well that's the market pricing it in and that'll be the end of that. Efficient market my ass.; Some decent market timing so far. LULU bought now +52%, Burberry +42% in 2 months. I'm actually quite bullish China and the entire world cutting rates, so these consumer discretionary stocks will do well. Thinking about selling them and buying Kering which has lagged.; Market happy?; Macquarie raises APP outlook from $270 to $450. 

Come on guys, now you're just scrambling to fall in line.; Anyone else holding on selling for the next few weeks for tax purposes? Don’t think next year will be as good so rather move some profits to next year.

Market, please don’t crash in the meantime.; I recently sold some VOO to pick stocks and I need to remind myself how most people never beat an S&P500 index. Its just hard to resist stock picking. I look smart now but who knows in a year; ""Senators requesting a probe by the FTC on behavior of company"", dumb dkng and flut down

In more fun news my OMAB position is +13% already, Mexican airports were so juicy glad to see market agreeing; AMZN has been having the run of a lifetime for the past week and a half. Feeling pretty good about my 572 shares.; Is it normal to feel more anxious when the market hits all-time highs frequently compared to when it dips?; Anyone else hold several stocks that aren't anywhere near ATH.  

It tough for me to be fearful when I hold stuff like NU, UBER, and WBD which just arent near their ATH. 

You can probably throw in SE which at 52 week high but nowhere near its 2021 levels in terms of valuation and price.; Palantir now nearly $170B on $2.5B of sales and $365M of operating income. What in the hell is happening. ; Now, this is a bit of an ignorant question, but it got me curious. You've had all of the kiddos pumping every stock under the sun in 2021 and now we're doing the same, but in 2021 it was due to stimmies and QE so there was supposedly extra liquidity. 

How do you explain 2024 then, is there still extra liquidity in the system? Or is this not as sustanaible as 2021?; Crypto beyond BTC is rallying. For me its a clear indicator that the stock market is red hot.

It could stay like that for months though so useless information 😂; Doing some more scouting in Europe names, inpost seems intresting here. Valuation is not super cheap but peg is great, Poland is a good home market to dominate with its gdp growth and they have promising new expansions into pan euro targets; Who buyin UBER today; Watching that FICO chart hurts; I bought the DKNG/FLUT flash crash.

The Senator bringing the inquiry said DKNG/FLUT have an oligopoly. DKNG/FLUT not supposed to have a moat so I bought thinking the case wouldnt go anywhere.; Somewhat tempted to jump into my ""fallen angels"" watchlist (celh, tmdx, aspn) with gains taken from highflyers, I have traded and done well in the past on them but all at much higher prices. Perhaps wisest to wait and watch for any signs of momo returning. Feels like for aspn it was the election vibe shift more than last Q earnings, for tmdx and celh it was rough reports; All the bears are in hibernation I guess; It’s obviously all about the payrolls number today. 244k is expected. 

From the sounds of it, this release will have to walk a tightrope to satisfy investors:

Too hot — too many jobs created — and it will bring fear that the Fed will not be able to cut rates. Too soft — too few jobs created — and it will raise concerns that the economy is softening.; $TDW to $40? Oil and gas getting hit this morning across the board looks like; APP $400, wild; Added to my LVMUY holdings long term.  Bought 1.5k$.  I'm too concentrated in the US.  Trying to find other opportunities here.; Celsius is immune to any price upgrades or positive news or any spikes whatsoever. 

Buy today by needham. Stock up 9%, then tanks to 1% up. Probably red by EOD then -5% Tom; costco 1000 inevitable; Welp, APP is…red on the day 🧐; APO and WDAY to be included in SP500.; Found out why Meta is going bonkers, aside from the jobs report evidently the courts ruled against Tik Tok.

Can't say I am saddened by this, financial reasons aside. 

I can't stand Tik Tok. 

Maybe it's not a good idea for a foreign power to be in control of our social media.; I’m glad I stayed long on AMZN when a lot of folks were complaining about the stagnant price since 2021. 

Still plenty of upside too; Meta; Option trades for next week:

* PII - $65 put, 1/17 expiration, 12/20 target date, wait for it to cross the 8-day EMA and trend back down
* CCJ - $60 call, $65 target, 1/17 expiration, 12/20 target date, peak gamma exposure at $65 + positive momentum
* JNJ - $150 put, $145 target, 1/17 expiration, 12/20 target date, strong gamma exposure at $145 + downwards momentum
* CCI - $100 put, $95 target, 12/20 expiration, 12/13 target date, went up to 8-day EMA and near-term VWAP to get rejected + downwards momentum
* WMT - $96 call, $100 target, 1/17 expiration, 12/20 target date, peak gamma exposure at $100 + monstrous momentum
* CZR - $38 put, $35 target, 1/17 expiration, 12/20 target date, cleared 8-day EMA + VWAP to the downside, only initiate when it breaks below the supporting liquidity pocket at $37.30; Every time I look at my AMZN stock and earnings, I ask myself why I don't own more. It should be like 10% of my portfolio but it's only 3% now. Same with Google, Microsoft.; Unemployment numbers are in the sweet spot for a strong economy, inflation down.

Like let's get QQQ and spy 40% ytd.; Meta up over 3% again. Almost 9% for the week.

Man, this is the kind of week I love to see!; [So what stage do you guys think we're at today?](https://i0.wp.com/transportgeography.org/wp-content/uploads/main_stages_bubble.png?resize=1024%2C635&ssl=1); Got fed up and bought a starting position of 10 shares of PLTR. ; Everyone here literally doubling their portfolios no matter what stock they put their money in and yet there are tons of people out there that have no assets at all and work for peanuts. It's mad. Where is all the funny money coming from?; I forgot to set my buy orders for Shopify this morning... RIP I guess.; Gotta love how UNH continues to tumble despite absolutely zero impact on fundamentals. Great market we're in; What stocks do we think are going to be added in the s&p announcement EOD today?; """"Mexican airport operator Grupo Aeroportuario del Centro Norte, reports that terminal passenger traffic at its 13 airports increased 9.9% in November 2024, as compared to November 2023"""" - thats why OMAB is up today I believe; Tsla gamma bomb; Lol amd of course had to go for the last second dump to -2%; Every Q4 my shit goes down and tech goes up; NNOX? WHAT DO YOU THINK? and WKSP?; the upcoming crash on all these bloated companies is going to just be epic.

similar to the 25% drops post earnings we had in 2022 (amazon for example)

edit: lol, apparently people are delusional and think these valuations are ok.; Santa rally!

This sub was also mega wrong on lulu.; That META post election dip was yummy; My prediction:

Growth keeps destroying the market until Jan. Minor sell off as profits are taken 

Continues to destroy the market from March onwards; I think we'll continue to see the winners keep winning up until end of December.  Not much to tax loss harvest with all the winners this year.  Institutions want to show they are in winners.  Then we see a slight correction in January.; I trimmed APP again. Every time I shave off a few shares, it runs up another 20% though; VIX extremely low.; ""BRIEF-U.S Dept Of Commerce To Provide UpTo $33 Mln Proposed Direct Funding To Coherent, Upto $16 Mln to Skywater Technology Foundry and Upto $50 mln to X-Fab"" - intresting, kind of forgot about the Texas fab Xfab owns lol, SkyT up nicely on that news even though its tiny $; Microsoft is looking really really bullish these days.  I'm a buyer today, late for the party but the beer is still cold enough.; MSFT an absolute bull. Don’t really know how high they can go but man what a great company.; Everyone should sell their portfolio and go all in on JOBY now. My nan knows a janitor that works there that says they've cracked it and it's all kicking off.; Wait people think the UNH dip is from the CEO death and not the future of Medicare/Medicaid under the next admin?

Are people entering the sector not realizing ELV, CNC, HUM etc in sector been tanking for a couple weeks.; ngl this market is insanely bullish now

im maintaining most of my positions

but i believe it is prudent to move some money to HYSA in case we have a real crash

and i will leverage heavily (margin + LETFs) in case the aforementioned crash actually happens

any problems with this thesis? ofc its very difficult to time the bottom; ACHR is the future?

I listened to you guys and bought 3k shares a week ago and already up 20% or so. Best decision ever!! What do you see it in 2 months? And any hope of getting to 13$ a share?; I think the next four years will be a massive economic boom.

Jpow pulled off a soft landing!

Let's fuckin get it; My UNH puts hit the stop loss on that gap up and I couldn’t buy more on fidelity 💔 had to go to Robinhood; Who else is adding UNH? I'm selling 545 puts and buying some leaps.; At what price does SNPS become enticing. I am tempted to open a starter position here. Bullish on the whole industry in the long term. They are one of the companies seeing an AI boom and a general bust.; I have a few Semi equipment names to the point that now I think an ETF might be better. However most Semi etfs have NVDA as their top holding which I am seeking to avoid since I am >50% in S&P500 whose top holding is also NVDA. 

Any suggestions? 
I own positions in TSM, ASML, AMAT, LRCX and interested in owning Synopsis and beaten down Semi companies.; Is there any reason why $META won't be the next megacap to hit $2T?; [deleted]; 6,099.97 on SPX.; [removed]; I think funds are selling of non-tech throughout the day after initial morning pops, then buying back in at end of day. Rinse and repeat.

It’s the same pattern - non tech up in the am, followed by slow bleed to barely up/red in the pm.; Is it a dumb move to buy Tesla puts? Thinking of getting some 370 12/20 puts next week.; $RCAT 🚀 EOW; Anyone here got ever conned into bagholding Disney, Intel or Paypal? I wonder if the hype posts about x company being undervalued ever worked for people to buy such crap stocks.; Wth nvda… shit trading sideways- can’t break out.; Thanks to President trump for this bull run. 

Trump still hold the record for presiding over the greatest year for stocks on record in 30 years. 

S&P500 had a 33% gain in 2019; [deleted]; Advanced money destroyers; Too expensive and a laggard in ai priced like its a leader imo; Insane how it's fucking red every single day for months on end yet they seem to be doing actual good work for the most part; It's a terd; Life isn't that easy or nobody would work; Because people who understand risk management know this is how you lose all your money. You can get lucky 10 times and then go bankrupt when the 11th instance is wrong.; You probably didnt because of fears of valuation and the other negative stuff said about PLTR/TSLA. In hindsight after the stocks go up it easy. But at the time this sub can get toxic sometimes with high flying stocks.

Those werent the only Trump stocks the Private equity firms such as KKR and APO were a couple others. They haven't gone up as much as TSLA/PLTR but glad I hold them since I need non-tech stocks in portfolio.; You could have easily lost your ass if it didn't work out. It's just not a good idea to full port anything, unless you're talking about a really small account, and it's not going to bankrupt you or affect your future; In the end you just gotta quell that voice. Anyone who's significantly online ""could've bought bitcoin in 2010"" and been a millionaire or billionaire now. Or did the same with APPL, NVDA, MSFT, etc. Just gotta keep looking forward.; It’s not too late 👍; so eventually does that mean other countries stock market look appealing and everyone who goes on CNBC won't be pounding their fists on the table saying you should only invest in US stocks and play the broadening trade?; Sell side targets just follows the stock price.; Interesting stat I saw on X:

> The smallest company in the S&P 500 is $AMTM at $5B market cap. 
> 
> The largest eligible name not in the S&P 500 is $APP at a mere $137B, or 27x the size of $AMTM.

Maybe APP gets announced to join the S&P 500  (the changes  are scheduled to be announced today), and that top ticks it. I sold another small chunk now. By next week I'll probably be fully out.; Me! I hold too many of my old company stocks .. Going to sell a few in January.; We're in a historical, almost bull run. You're right, making money right now is very easy. It's best to not get used to it.; Stick to a strict percentage of your portfolio. Also VONG, MGK, SCHG have all outperformed VOO handsomely the last few years. Food for thought for alternate ETFs that have shown very good growth; It's much easier to overperform short term, it's very hard to overperform over 30 years. So I orient my strategy around that, short term trading=stock picking. Long term investment and retirement= etfs.; I'm all stocks. Bring on the pain; Even if only 1 out of 100 people could beat the s&p 500, in the u.s. Alone that is potentially like a million people who could beat it. It might be a tough goal but it's more possible than like making the NBA or getting a crazy high paying job; I am up 2% overall on OMAB and 20% on PAC 
Maybe I got in a bit early but all good.; Airports. 👍; Price to ocf for AMZN was getting to its 2009 levels, I thought that either the price had to move up or market had fundamentally changed how it thought about amzn, looks like it was the former; 572 shares!? You work there or smthn?; the top is when retail investors are not anxious; If you feel anxious you are going to feel that way a decent amount of the time: ""The S&P 500 set a new high on 6.96% of all trading days""; I hold quite a lot near 52 week lows, but that is on purpose, I tend to turnover my portfolio a lot selling high flyers and buying fear; Its called the '3rd world dictatorship corruption trade' or at least thats what im calling it.

PLTr to 100 PS, TSLa to $1000 fuck it.

""fundamentals friday"" HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA; Bought in at $16. Sold at $40 on earnings day thinking ""things are getting dicey"". Two days later they're cracking through $65. I feel stupid but think ""ah, it'll sit here at $65, like when ARM rocketed up"" (I bought ARM the same day I bought PLTR this January and sold when it hit $120 a few weeks later).

Now it's cracking $76. I've had a great year and I don't regret selling when I did as I think it just as easily could've taken a dive, but damn if that wouldn't have been the icing on the cake.; [deleted]; > How do you explain 2024 then, is there still extra liquidity in the system? Or is this not as sustainable as 2021?

Yes, quite a bit. It will peak in late 2025.; Hawktuah girl launched a coin pump and dump and pocketed over $2 mill from it. If that isn't a hype top indicator I don't know what is.; What % do you usually allocate to non US?; Somehow my MGM dropped on that news too, which is odd since if anything that would be good for the distant 3rd laggard betmgm; If we are in a bull market it tends to work out more than not.

My fallen angel was KNSL. It had an earnings dip last month. I loaded the boat in the 420s. Now it in the 520s just one month later. I dont even remember why KNSL dipped for anymore.; Humans kill bears and breed bulls.; It appears to have walked the rope.

Better than expected nonfarm with expected unemployment.

They're gonna name a building in DC after JPow when this is all said and done.; With lv you're investing in china, not europe; I hopped out at $120 but thinking about getting back in; There was a class action lawsuit that (somewhat correctly imo) pointed out that management was not upfront about Pepsi overordering in 2023 and misrepresented the success of the business. So there's some negative sentiment there. But I do believe the worst is behind us. There's a strong floor at $25. Just sucks that I have a lot of money tied up in this stock while everything else is pumping. But nothing is going to change materially until next earnings report when they can actually put a number on it and say Pepsi is starting to order more.; I don’t get it, doesn’t move on positive news and dumps on anything else; 60 PE for a fucking retailer.

insert meme of Kitty throwing the intelligent investor book in the trash; Bought my first shares in it at the end of 2020. Continued to invest in it this year. Have 14.3 shares in it atm, just hoping it continues to flourish.; Wonder if it was because it was expected to be added. Sp500?; I think if you put a COST like multiple on AMZN retail and a proper tech multiple on AWS, and so on, the sum of the parts value would be substantially higher today. The stagnant price is perfect for people like me who weren't able to buy / didn't bother in 2022-3.

Plus market is probably sleeping on Anthropic.; I bought it april 2020 and almost anything else has outperformed; Amazon is a funny company.  It's consumer cyclical and tech.  Its a strong time of year to own both.

Congratulation on your investing.; Is absolutely crushing it

8.7% for the week.; Im at Google 9%, Meta 8%, AMZN 7%, then it falls off to the <5.5%; inflation down? we've consistently got hotter than expected readings in the last few months. and what happens when apartment supply actually dries up by next year?; It just keeps going. Im a little sad I sold half for profits but still have some skin on the game.; The technicals on META and teck in general are very very strong.; Delusion or new paradigm; Im starting to go with Tom Lee. It is better to be a perma bull then worry about corrections. I made way more money buying and going long in stocks than panic selling once the stock hit a 52 week high or shorting.; [deleted]; Once you accept that the US system is intentionally set up to benefit people owning assets and devalue the dollar/ workers' earned income it's easier to reorient your thinking and planning. Real estate, stocks, businesses. Own those and you'll be moving with the tide instead of against it like you'd be relying fully on earned income and saving cash.

It's not my preferred world but it's what we're dealing with.; QE distorted the shit out of our economy. If you don’t own assets, you’re feeling the sting of that printing. 

The K shape recovery couldn’t be more obvious yet few seem to realize what happened. It seems like finance people are literally the only ones who understand what’s happening. ; It is quite insane asset owners can gain more value in a day than a basic worker will make in a few lifetimes, esp if you look at other countries.; Not every one is financial literate. Just look at those Caleb Hammer videos.

One of the first steps to investing is just not living pay check to pay check to be able to risk your extra money in the market. But unfortunately not a lot of people have extra money.; Its also the wonder of compounding.  The more you save and invest, the more you make exponentially.  Rich people have the luxury to save more, invest more - and the income disparity will grow regardless of how much the government will try to stop it.  It becomes a feedback loop.

Look at the difference of one who puts in 200$ bucks a month vs another with $400 invested in a 30 year time frame.; I haven't doubled yet; I don't make much, but put everything I have in stocks. I don't care if it goes down, I'll never be rich anyways. I just want the chance of it going up; Great buying opportunity if you're looking for an entry imo. There's an endless supply of suits behind Brian that will fill his spot and it will be business as usual. The guy isn't even the CEO of the overall company UHG.; XLV has been in free fall since October. Health care is underperforming across the board.; Who knows what could be uncovered behind the shooting. Market hates uncertainty more than anything; Literally dragged me into the red today lol. AMD truly is team red; Not owning tech, what a miss; Go all in bro, party like it's 2021; People long the likes of GOOG and AMZN should cream themselves if we get another 2022.; Nostradamus; There were plenty of people wanting to buy it on here. Also lots of I don't knows. Also a lot of people who hated it. 

How do you pick which one is the consensus of the sub?; Yup! Glad I kept buying (avg price of $307). ; I saw the vision at around $250. I thought it could keep sinking to $200 for a cigar butt deal. LMAO that was a terrible decision in hindsight.; Upvotes are what is popular in the current 24 hours. So if a stock is down people will trash it. If a stock is too high people will go it is overvalued and get upvotes. With the second example this can easily cost people money as well if they sell the stock too early thinking it overvalued an it keeps going up.; “This sub was wrong”

What else is new.; you basically described the stock market since the 08 recession; The only question is mid or late January.  

The cycles are behaving normally so far.; Trigger finger ready on SVIX when VIX jumps; Bull? They lagged the entire year; Amazon would like a word; I'm rdunk today and going all in fraind!  YEEEEE HAAAAWWWW!!!  Haven't even looked at it.; Maybe i missed the boat on that but there’s no way i can buy it now, the market cap is bigger than some airlines; UNH probably down in particular because it put a giant spotlight on their egregious denial rates during many people's health insurance open season.; The timing is certainly curious. Those other companies have been on a downtrend since Sept. UNH has been flat. Now it's dropped 10% in two days. That just does not happen to this stock outside of some big news. That big news is kinda obvious.; It's def bad pr related to how many people are happy their ceo got offed in broad daylight. Maybe a crwd like buying opportunity though; It's very clearly because of the news.; Market expects corporate tax cuts, lower regulations, and no significant tariffs. None of these are guaranteed. Corporate/Cap gains tax cuts especially rely on a 1-3 member GOP majority in the House. I've heard the phrase ""Buy the election and sell the inauguration"" for this year- regardless of that I'm expecting things to waver next year. Right now all the bullish business hopes are being priced in before the actual fighting to enact them begins.; The market is still overpricing the long term inflationary risk of trump tariffs. I continue to see yields going down, causing HYSA to return less. I think 2025 will still be good for stocks, but not as great as 2024 so I would continue to buy noteable dips but get ready for increased volatility. If you can stomach it, you can still make 15%-20% upside; HYSA will likely have less interest going forward.

I thought that was a part of the current rally. People were taking cash out those savings to do opposite and buy stocks.; I'd just stock pick if you're getting detailed enough that you're targeting subsectors. SMH has a higher proportion of foundry and equipment holdings than SOXX if you want to diversify.; SMHX has only fabless companies in their ETF so Cadence and Synopsys, but they also hold Astera labs and Nvidia, its kinda hard to find something that doesn’t have Nvidia in it, 

I’m about to load up on ASML though, there’s a bit of a negative stigma around it right now and that only makes me more bullish towards it. That company has such strong fundamentals, anybody acting like those machines are going to fade into irrelevancy are delusional imo.; Only reason I can think of, is some sort of legislation against META to protect young girls or something. Because of Instagram. Basically some sort of regulation or fine that could affect their business model slightly; If shadow president decides to gut punch meta?; Look at the amount they are buying, it's exposure. It's not even a rounding error for them.; They know when to but and when to sell, and are always happy to sell calls when IV spikes; What is good value for calls? You mean low IV?; MSFT Jan monthly calls have IV under 20%. Expecting it to play catch up.; AMD; WMT; Never buy puts against the trend. Wait until there is a clear negative catalyst and then scalp the movement. You don’t need to call the absolute top.; Tsla is a corruption stock, the whole ridiculous valuation is betting on it being an oligarch stock now. Trying to bet against that may not be the best move. 

If it was under any other circumstance then it may have been a good move.; I wouldn't do it unless it's a hedge. They want to push this to 400.; I was considering it, but 12/20 seems too soon imo; [deleted]; Why would anyone buy puts on tsla right now?; Buy calls instead of puts.; Bump; Yes; Yes.

It might work from time to time, but stay away from shorting this thing until you get more clear signs outside of speculation about personalities not clashing (which many have had), that Elon is going to have a fall out with Trump.

Frankly at this point, I think $500ish comes by February of next year. This thing can run THAT HOT when it's on absolute fire off call options and as I said...it might as well be Vice President Musk.; He's not gonna give you a cabinet post bro

Actually...he might, if you keep those compliments coming; Did you forget the trade war up and down cycle we had to live through; I prefer MNDY as a stock, but ofc asan is 3x cheaper on price/sales basis so if your right it could run nicely to match the higher valuations; If AMD is too expensive then it'll be hard to justify stocks like PLTR, TSLA, etc; That means at some point the trend will reverse and begin going upwards if they're *actually* making good progress and start eating up more market share. I own some - not *displeased* with it, but I also would enjoy if it continued going up.; GEO is the big one, I don't hold it due to my own moral misgivings with the company but it went up 50% the day after the election was called.; I know. It's annoying because there's very little incentive to do risk management on the sell-side, which instead falls upon the shoulders of people like me.; Nah sell AFTER the sp500 inclusion.; I'm cutting my stake down to 50% from 66% on Monday. As a rule of thumb, I don't interfere with momentum and there's too much institutional support behind APP for it to collapse. However, the expectations for the e-commerce vertical are getting too high.; thanks, didnt know about those; I think you have to ask yourself if it’s worth the work/risk required to beat the index. Is it even possible to work hard enough to beat it? I think it’s mostly luck and partly hard work, whereas getting a high paying job is partly luck and mostly hard work. If 99% of people can’t beat the index and it requires 0 work it’s a no brainer; Very nice, I would rather be early and avg down than miss a big move; I do. I should diversify, but I mean...; David Rosenberg just straight up said on Twitter that this rally is justified. That in itself signifies a top must be near; Yea time will tell. Uber seems like a stock where the answer wont be known for 1-2 years. Problem is people dont like to wait. They dont like uncertainty.; What growth scenario can you possibly scribble out that can make up for this unholy enterprise value. We are talking about $0.04 of quarterly operating income on a $75 share price. ; Concerning. You've got a chart?; 2m is nothing, that OF lady gets 45m a year from her simps; Just makes BTC that much more bullish; Wtf? People still fall for those? Are NFTs making a comeback?; Normally, very little. Right now I'm 60/40 roughly though; It was a situation of a headline without an article. I bought asked questions later. With more info it seems a Senator isn't happy DKNG/FLUT control 90% of the market.

So it seems like if true isnt that good for DKNG/FLUT to control that much market share. If not and DKNG/FLUT can make the case they have no moat which many on this sub and market may already believe then the case goes nowhere.; Indeed

Well let’s see where this loosening cycle ends up…; I haven't done much DD into it. Is the current price worth entering?; This book is 75 years old, and probably not that relevant anymore. Since then we've had the internet, bots that trade on technical analysis, 16 year old kids with RobinHood app on their smartphones, tons of influencers on IG and TT causing tens of millions of people to FOMO into the market...

Today's market is night and day different. You shouldn't analyze it by the same standards. This is why at the moment I use basic TA purely; That was my speculative guess.; Applying a COST like multiple on anything is kinda crazy lol. It's a unicorn in terms of premium. But I agree there's a lot of good things in AMZN's pipeline in the next 5-10 years. I would buy but my wife works there and has held on to all her RSUs and has destroyed me in the market as I sweat and check daily charts and waste away hours lmao.; Yea META has outperformed the last few years, but not going to sell it; I remember when everyone said it was tanking when it hit $98 months ago. I despise FB, but damn what a comeback; I keep hoping for a split.; I'm a pretty consistent perma-bull myself but valuations are getting hard to ignore.  Not a bad time to take some profits off the table and/or diversify away from sectors which are overheating.; panic selling is NEVER a good idea

Before you buy any stock, you have to make a decision if it's in bucket A or bucket B.

Bucket A = Ride or Die. Longterm mindset. You only sell if there's a material change to your original purchase thesis

Bucket B = Not Ride or Die, so you have a stop loss and you've already made yourself comfortable with a specific maximum loss amount. You have more of a swing trade mindset

Bucket A = Marriage

Bucket B = Fling; Always loved this Lynch quote:

*“Far more money has been lost by investors in preparing for corrections, or anticipating corrections, than has been lost in the corrections themselves.”*; Buy high, sell higher!; US bull market is strongest in innovation assets and American institutions buying more crypto under trump, while most foreign countries’ bull market are on housing, workers across the world are benefiting from quality of life improvement at the very least when innovation investment boom.; Not just the US, I'd argue the UK is worse. At least you have plenty of land over there.; [deleted]; Yes, that is the crux of my poorly framed comment. I'm the only one really in my friend and family circle that has grasped what happened during the pandemic money printing bonanza (and to a large degree what has been happening since 2008) and it's like I'm living in a completely separate reality.; Yeah, that's partly why I wrote the comment. They're losing endless amounts of money to inflation. If you look at average wages here in the UK and average market returns since the pandemic, such people have probably effectively lost more money than they've earned.; Yet under capitalism wealth generated usually lasts 2 or 3 generations. Under more centrally controlled economies there is typically a lot less social mobility within families.; UNH was doing really well until yesterday; lol you guys are always the sellers at bottoms. What are you even talking about?; Shoulda bet on team green; Right. Seems like he already knows the solution.; Oh my bro, so sorry, i buy today at 7.50; If the market was so easy why do we fluctuate from fear to greed, risk off to risk on so quickly? Everyone is all gangster and gung ho until they get tested; yes, we will never have a pullback and these companies will keep going up forever, even with forward pe's of 200. 

this time is different huh?; There are also the people who are silent when a stock is down and then pop up once the stock goes up 10-30% to go I bought when it was down.; since the era of Central Banks just adding infinite liquidity and preventing red.

How much worse can income inequality get before theres a worldwide crisis. This is bonkers; Perfect; Short?; Even more reason to be bullish on it.  I LOVE It when a good business lags with a low PE ratio.  

Amazon is soaring right now, hang onto that.; Yup.

UNH had been the strongest health insurance stock, it was 2.3% from its ATH before the last couple days had sent it down 10%.; Honestly, it's going to be an SOB and a half for much at all to occur outside of reconciliation to try to extend TCJA and cut the chips act and infrastructure bill.

Not sure you get a further tax cut. 

Anyway, yeah, anything more by the S&P to close 2024 just continues to decrease the possibility of a 2017 replay, which looks like it was low volatility and a 20%ish increase on the year. More likely that this year gets skipped if we're going to attempt to just directly compare to Trump's first term.; yes i am aware

but it is prudent to trim my positions

Can you elaborate a bit please; Thanks for the insight. So just let it’s do its thing rn right? Also Tesla ITM calls and puts are insanely expensive 💀; Not planning to short , just buying regular puts. Shorting is way too risky; Cause running on hype rn, a single bad news will cause a pullback like last time; Oh I’m not shorting, just buying normal puts 🫡; Wouldn’t be surprised to see $500 too, but if and when it falls. It falls HARD. It fell from $180 to $110 in less than a month in 2022; how long until it hits $150?; I agree, I don't own any of those; There's nothing wrong with not putting in the work and accepting s&p returns. But if you can beat it significantly? And all it requires is to read and click a button to buy? That's easy work, I wouldn't even call work since it's a hobby of mine to keep up with business news. Maybe I wouldnt suggest it to everyone. But if you're someone who loves to obsess about something, obsessing about stocks puts you in the higher percentile of investors. Because a huge amount of investors do no research and buy what they like, based on nothing but sentiment. Or get shares from work, or inherit shares. There's so many subsets of investors that are working with less tools than I am, that drag down the percentage of people who would be successful. Thinking about all the people who invest who are at a heavy disadvantage, makes me more confident that I could maybe be in that 1% of people. I could be wrong. But so far the risk has paid off. That's not to say it always will. But I like the chance to try, and learn while I go; Uber is very interesting here, not sure I want to hold it through all the news stories that are going to move it but I think waymo partnering with them is meaningful, if Google doesnt want full verticalization then the main AV bear case for Uber seems overblown by a lot; The secular cycle is roughly [65 months](https://imgur.com/YvjBa5v) and reflects the debt turnover cycle.; I guess the publicity works seeing as you believe it.; You're YTD like 50%+ and 40% international?? That's genuinely crazy. Though for me international = index funds only, while I'm guessing you bottom ticked some Chinese tickers...; Yes imo this is a great entry for the next 3-5 years but you have to have patience. This is not a tech stock. They're moving physical product in a very competitive market with basically no moat beyond customer preference. International expansion is still early days but everything is pointing to it going well. It's popular amongst genz and more importantly women. They're expanding the market not just stealing share from Redbull & Monster. Downside is leadership does not seem to care about shareholders at all. They are just focusing on executing their playbook and look at the stock price as noise. But from every angle this stock is undervalued. The only thing that can go wrong from here is if they fuck up international or all of a sudden a new energy drink comes and dethrones them from the #3 spot.; Yeah I was exaggerating, I think it's undervalued even if you give it a premium like WMT or something too.; Months ago, try years ago.

That was 2022.

It had craters in November but was back almost to $200 a share by February.

Had it not been for the pandemic I might have panicked and sold.

Really glad I didn't.; Taking profits is a taxable event. I also dont want to be in a situation where I take profits creating that taxable even like take profit on META at $400 for the stock to keep going up.; I mean, that quote is intended for investors holding broad market index funds, not people YOLO'ing PLTR, NVDA and BTC with 100% of their portfolio; Personally, I invest because I have to, not because I have an ideological loyalty to how things work right now with all the details and processes that go along with that. Today's version of capitalism has put the costs of negative externalities on the vast majority of citizens to favor a small amount of owners to an unacceptable degree in my opinion, and increased automation is only going to make wealth inequality and the effects that we're already seeing with this K shaped economy much more severe. So as long as the system is set up this way, I think I need to get on the same train that Bezos is on. 

If things changed where labor had more power, capital gains were taxed closer to earned income, and there weren't huge tax incentives and loopholes for asset ownership I'd adjust my strategy.; It's maddening and quite disheartening. I think we're witnessing the greatest wealth transfer in history, and almost no one is aware of what's going on. It seems like no matter their political leanings, what's been happening completely flies over the heads of most people.

I'm worried where this is all heading. Inequality is already horrendous and if anything, appears to be accelerating. If you don't hold assets, you've fallen behind and I think are likely to only fall further behind going forward. Then when the next recession arrives, we'll print our way out of it and rob the working class even more. Rinse and repeat.; I just visited the UK (London) recently. What's insane is that the cost of living there is similar to the most expensive cities in the US but the wages are like... Indiana, US. Add on terrible stock returns, and basically the only people with wealth are those who inherited it. 

On a side note, whenever I read a comment like yours above, it's almost always the case that poster is from Canada or the UK. A decade of GDP per capita being stagnant  takes its toll.; I sold small amounts of UNH at profit yesterday and bought puts today. If it Vs I can buy back at a discount; Some people just don't want to be rich; I just watched my largest holding in ASML drop from a high of nearly $1,100 go all the way down to $650 after short term guidance shifted. I was buying at under $600 when I went in deep. It made up over 25% of my holdings at one point. That's just a recent test. People who are truly holding long understand the fundamentals of the businesses they hold, and short term fluctuations of market price create opportunities.

I didn't sell one share as it climbed or decreased, then I nibbled as the stock approached a very enticing valuation once again.; It depends on the individual company. None of mine have pe over 60 I don't think, as if that were the only thing to consider anyways. Id have to check again. But, markets trend up over time.; Yes usually VIX has a massive recovery after a spike, for example August 5th of this year.  
When VIX spiked SVIX went to 19$, and within less than two weeks was 32$, about 68%, in and out.; low PE ratio? It's quite expensive relative to it's 10-15 year valuation.; If you're trading nothing wrong with that. Personally I'm pulling back on the amount I'm DCAing and building some saved cash before next year.; It is a good place to park money not invested. But dont expect to get life changing money off your savings account.; But did he lick the taint; just go with momentum, at least till January, not a financial advice; He thinks this simple strategy is a good way to time the market; People have been saying this about $tsla since it IPO’d and it is still exceeding ATHs.

One bull case from their talking heads is all you need is for Waymo to not be a monopoly. If one other company makes AV work that increases the odds of Uber being the aggregator.; Thanks!; I wasnt 40% international most of the year, I did get lucky in some china names (should have held a little longer though) but most of my YTD gains was USA speculative names I have now sold and moved the winnings over to more value/garp; There's a lot of EX-US companies doing well this year. MELI, NU, CSU, ADYEN, SE....; Wait are you guys saying allocation 40% or 40+% gains YTD, I think op is saying the former.; Oh shit ya I must have been in a coma. That didn’t seem like that long ago. Either way, it’s come way back up since. Facebook is just a behemoth of the social networks; [deleted]; As you said - many don't realise. 

I grew up pretty poor and most of my close family are still poor, including my parents who are still working full-time in what should be their retirement years. I've done fairly well for myself, but not really well enough to help them out, and even if I could, they would not accept it.

They don't understand what has happened. Like most of the British working class, they don't pay much attention to economics and are pretty financially illiterate. Neither of them finished school to boot, as my mum dropped out of school due to getting pregnant and my dad left early to work on a farm.

My brother is in a not too dissimilar position - living in a council house, and he's just been in a bad accident a few years ago that has messed him up and prevented him working since. He has 3 kids and they're all doomed to the cycle with nothing bequeathed.

Disheartening is probably right, but when I think about it too much I think it's a bit of an understatement.

They are all and have been the embodiment of sisyphus - pushing the boulder up the hill to provide for themselves and their children, all the meanwhile destroying their bodies and losing their precious time on earth - and the inflation has been pushing the boulder right back down.; Yeah, our wages are terrible. I could earn 4 or 5 times what I do if I lived in the US as a software engineer. I'm a net contributor here as well, which is actually rare given you need to be on around £50k just to be contributing more to the state that it's currently spending per head, bearing in mind the average wage is just under £40k. And things only look set to get worse. I should probably look at leaving.; This totally checks out; I'm 35% YTD no tech with a portfolio that has half the risk ; Well, I'm pretty bearish so I'm hoping we won't have a ""massive recovery"" after the spike.

This is a bubble of gigantic proportions. I see VIX going a little lower and then a big spike soon, and hopefully no recovery for the foreseeable future. I'd love to snatch some META at 300.; Ancient history, different business.; Yeah lol this is wild low PE lol; I thought expecting life changing money was the quickest way to go broke in the stock market?

I have enough in my HYS to replace my roof, as I add more I will consider moving some of it elsewhere, but 4.75% isn't terrible.; [deleted]; Ahh so wait until January? NFA?; Yea it exceeds ATH in the long run but short term, money can be made imo. and you mean invest those puts in a different stock?; OP said in a different comment yesterday 50% YTD, the 40% is allocation. Gotta keep up with the /r/stocks lore mate!; I think publicly traded companies are by and large a great thing, they're accessible for the public to participate, they have stringent reporting and transparency requirements to protect investors from malfeasance, and they're liquid to help the companies grow and improve which has helped support our economy. It has a lot of good, but it also leads to some negative situations when certain services and businesses end up chasing profit growth over providing quality service such as health insurance companies or prisons or certain utilities. This gets especially bad when an industry is predisposed to monopoly. The profit motive, especially the one pushed by the publicly traded stock system, can lead to worse outcomes for society when applied to things that probably should not be solely incentivized via profit motive. Still, I think having a robust publicly traded credit system is much better than an all private equity system.

Interestingly there is a big shift back to private credit markets that are more closely gate-kept, so even the credit markets are becoming less democratic and transparent lately. This, to me, could be another long term threat to class mobility.

As for taxes, I think income and long term cap gains rates should be closer and loopholes that allow things like Elon Musk leveraging stocks to buy a company with no cap gains tax should be dialed down. I don't think investment returns should be incentivized so heavily over direct pay for work/salary. Maybe reduce income taxes a bit and raise long term cap gains imo.; One must imagine sisyphus happy. It really is the only way not to be crushed under the reality of it.; Most of the US is a terrible place to live however, a giant generic non walkable suburb, with some exceptions. But those exceptions don't hold a handle to European cities.

If you are a London person, maybe Look into New York, San Francisco. The homeless encampments and zombies are something you'd get used to, but not a lot of other cities in the US that are somewhat walkable and that have architecture with a minimum of aesthetic sense.

The way most Americans live will have you on anti depressants within a year.; Wanna see receipts?; Just a different kind of risk; ""Far more money has been lost by investors trying to anticipate corrections, than lost in the corrections themselves.”    
Personally I don't really see a bubble beyond a few companies with expensive valuations.; Wait for it.....; Do you guys talk this way in real life; Ah, gotcha; Hahaha right on, mate!; [deleted]; Haha okay. Interesting!"
159,How Long Will You Keep DCA?,"Let's say you are doing DCA for stocks you have high convictions, such as NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, PLTR or RKLB.

And you are doing, say $200 per month or perhaps $500 every quarter (more or less, depending on your financial situations) per stock.

1) At what stage of the stock's life would you then decide to stop DCA? Especially for stocks like MSFT and AAPL that have been around for a long while?

2) Also, while you DCA, would you also sell your initial amount you bought? Or you'd let it ride?

3) What stocks are you guys DCA now?

Thank you folks! 🚀

",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h7x3kr/how_long_will_you_keep_dca/,0,2024-12-06 09:48:09,"I still have to understand wtf palantir does to deserve a P/E of 195; I've been selling down (selling some smaller positions entirely, trimming larger ones) a fair amount of what's done really really well this year and have built positions in recent weeks in a number of names that haven't. It's been a fantastic year and want to try and build on that.  A fair amount of growth to me feels increasingly 2021-ish again so the focus goes elsewhere.  I don't know that another 2022 is around the corner, but it wasn't that long ago and after 2020/21, it's kind of remarkable that only a few years later we're back to ""only goes up"" although for a more narrow portion of the market.

At some point the value/blend side I've built lately will probably shift back towards growth (which I prefer over value) but want to have the flexibility to look for opportunities in either.  I've done well enough this year with parts of growth that for me it's the equivalent of a baseball game and it's the 7th/8th inning and you know who's going to win already so you start heading for the exit to get ahead of the traffic. 

And this isn't anything against growth - still own a fair amount of growth and will continue to -  but after a very good year it felt like time to change the playbook somewhat rather than just keep pushing the same bets and hoping they will continue to work in the manner they already have this year. 


""3) What stocks are you guys DCA now?""

I think for me the issue becomes the market feels differently post covid. Anything that is really working gets overextended quicker than ever, anything that isn't working gets thrown out more aggressively than ever and there's everything in the middle. At some point it becomes increasingly difficult to find much that's that compelling in the what's working category and more starts to appeal in the bargain bin. For me, it's gotten to that point. 

I'd like to just own things long-term and there are things over the years that have wound up long-term holds but the way the market feels over the last 4-5 years, it almost feels like what one would reasonably expect over a year for something that's really working suddenly happens in a matter of months and then things eventually get ahead of themselves to a point where the risk/reward is quickly less appealing or unappealing. Some of the buying in the last month in a few things seems indiscriminate/increasingly FOMO-y.

So for me it's not ""gradually DCA into something over the long-term"" as much as I'd like although some things wind up as long-term holdings.  It's renovating the portfolio at times (more times in the last 4-5 years than I can recall ever doing) - taking out portions (removing or reducing a theme, for example), rethinking that portion and rebuilding it. I try to gradually sell into strength and often don't sell something entirely but reduce and keep a smaller portion. I've owned NVDA for years and would like to continue to own it with the cost basis that I have to some degree, but after +1,100% in two years it's been time to gradually trim rather than continue to DCA.; DCA is great if you want to continually invest in the market whenever you have some additional cash. Historically a lump sum will give you higher returns, except if you buy at the top of the market and only hold for a short time.; If we’re talking about LT investing, you would ideally be tracking the companies quarterly reports. Typically, a slip of 2-3 quarters should give you come caution. Now depending on how aggressive of an investor you are, you could sell into the strength and then buy back once the stock pull backs. I think everyone loves to talk about how much their up on a single stock but no one mentions when they sell. Have seen plenty of positions sit in green by 100% and then the holder slowly gives back every % without taking any profit.; Whether to continue DCA should depend on if the stock is still in your buy range or not.   Sometimes the stock gets over their skis for a while because of excessive bullish enthusiasm and are not good new investments.  It doesn't mean you need to sell if the growth picture is still intact.  A patient Hold is sometimes the best action.; When the mount you DCA become less then 10% the interest you gain 

If you DCA 100 a month but you gain more than 1000 per month the 100 dollars don't gonna change wildly anymore; Only when I need money, otherwise why would I leave the market,; In steady state, I usually DCA with diversified indices and do limit orders on specific good stocks at opportune times when they are discounted.

I normally am trying to increase diversification with least tax impact, not my concentration of the biggest winners. When the big winners seriously dwarf the initial investment, I lightly draw on them to fund other positions and recoup initial cost(e.g. selling 10%).

I don't tend to sell stocks of businesses I still believe in when they are overpriced, as long as conditions are still sound.; I am not a big DCA guy for reasons specific to my circumstances, but if I were I would stop when the percent allocation
reached my predetermined limit.; Do you know anything about the valuations of those stocks, and when the price you would pay for the stock has separated from the fundamental value by a large margin? Because if you don't know how to recognize a top, you are likely to find out the hard way.; I will DCA till i hit the 40 year mark or the 40mill mark which ever comes first.; lol this isn’t going to go well.; I DCA as long as we are trending up; About 10 shares of RIVN every week over the next year or so. Looking to accumulate around 1,000 shares before it takes off.; Tsla, pltr, diamond hand till end of the final light of the universe, never ever ever sell; Get ready for Nasdaq 100 inclusion in a week or 2.; What does it do? ..it shows the weaknesses of PE ratio as a method of measurement.; Jesus mother of god....; No idea too lol but continue to DCA?; ""Renovating the portfolio"" is so well put. Often time, I obsess over what I'm going to invest at that moment in time. I pull the trigger and forget about it. I come back to my portfolio a year later. Instead of renovating, I DCA and more often than not lose my way. 

It's a nice way of thinking. It requires discipline which I'm trying to cultivate.; Thanks for sharing. Many times, we are focused on fomo and getting in, and we forgot abt growth. I like the term Renovating your portfolio. I will keep that in mind!; Please can your share some of these stocks that are currently undervalued ?; This is sadly quite true. Or maybe, there's just no fun in sharing taking profits.; This is fair view. Never thought about %gain vs DCA before.; Better to DCA down to lower cost basis.; What's the logic begins RIVN?; Diamond hands is one of the most regarded string of letters ever put together by humankind; So you continue to DCA? Or just hold? 🤔; Yeah. Who cares is stock price is completely detached from company value.

I know. I know. ""future earnings""

Forward P/E is 162.38

People are literally paying $162 for every $1 PLTR *projects* in the next 12 months.

What a deal!; now you know when you should have stopped.. a few years ago; PNG; Yep the biggest your gain IS the less impactfull your DCA deposit IS; No, if we are trending down I exit my position and search for a different equity to hold.; So if i buy at $100, the stock goes up (like the market does 80% of the time) to $200, and i shouldnt have been buying at $110, $120 etc. instead i should buy at $190, $180 since its discounted from that $200 price? Got it.

Or am i expected to wait for it to magically go to $90 so i can truly lower my average. This is a pretty ridiculous take like obviously it would be better to lower your average with each buy, but stocks and s&p500 goes up far more often than it goes down.; I love getting hate from Reddit, its like Cramer shit talking your stocks. When the hate stops, then i will start worrying about the tops

As long as im reversing reddit im golden; Fuck your paper hands then.; Buy and hold, never stops, the space is the limit; Let them pay $400 dollars for the next 12 months ..because my ADHD will have had me pull out after 3-4 months :); And yet somehow it makes sense to everyone. When things come back down to reality, it’ll become so obvious how stupid it was in hindsight; Ah, buy high sell low, got it.; You bought GME at 100 huh?; This dude probably trades every fkin nanoseconds and cry when he underperforms ppl who just buys sp500 etf; Not for those who sold in profit.; On the contrary, sell high buy low:  
https://i.imgur.com/VVw1sUc.png; Nah man, I am mostly a Mag7 and S&P guy. My comment was what the response you would get if you question diamond hands.; Obviously doesn’t apply to them; If you buy on an uptrend, it means you’re buying in on a rally (aka FOMO). If you sell on a downtrend, you’re selling when everyone else is (fear). What’s that buffet quote?; Grow the fuck up we’re not in 2021 anymore. Diamond and paper hands doesn’t mean shit outside of the GME short squeeze; Then stupidity doesn't apply.; I think that graph is pretty self explanatory, working out well for me so far.; If you’re buying it at an inflated price, stupidity applies and will become apparent when the bubble bursts. If you bought before the inflated price and sold at a profit, the stupidity obviously does not apply to you. This is not hard to understand; Could have had more buying the dips and lowering your average, just saying.; ..you don't seem to understand ..and your saying its not hard to understand.. Ookaaay.; I hold mostly levered positions so holding during downtrends is not good for me, The problem is when the dips keep dipping.   
So instead of trying to time it I just follow the SMA strategy, no need to time the buys and sells.      
We were still above the SMA line when everything went down after the July 10th peak, so I DCA'd hard during that time and It worked out so far."

**Why write this?**   

* I feel like we need a solid fucking company.

* They weren’t listed on WSB’s Earnings board.
* I thought more people would like the YOLO.
* They POSSIBLY gave me a backpack when I was MAYBE working with them eight years ago.

**What is Rubrik ?** 

* Rubrik is a backup & recovery provider that sits on top of a company’s cloud infrastructure.

**What is an example of Backup & Recovery I can maybe understand?** 

* You drop your phone under a tire because you were to busy while parking, leading to a smashing of both it and the SIM card. The only fix is you buy a new phone, login with your iCloud email, and everything is restored from the cloud.
* Rubrik does the above and sells at-cost servers from partners like Dell, HPE, SMCI, etc. They protect data in places like AWS , Azure, and GCP.
* People pay whatever when they have no phone or car. Same here.

**How are you qualified?** 

* I worked at a research company for five years partnering with SaaS vendors $5M-$250M, for two of those years I CAN NEITHER CONFIRM NOR DENY they may have been a client.
* I transitioned to Software Engineering three years ago from Tech Sales. I have tracked them and understand both the sales pitch and technology pitch. 
* I saw them masterfully navigate researchers, which they still do, and become the golden child. Billions of dollars get validated by researchers.... it's importants.
   * [(Updated) They Poached the Magic in 2018](https://www.theregister.com/2018/05/01/rubrik_gartner_hires/). One is doable but not three of them it delayed the research paper a year that doesn’t happen unless a research analyst dies.
   * [(Updated) Because of 2018 poaching the late Fall report never got published (major delay), The 2019 Report Was Fought Back By Rubrik for Flawed Data](https://www.crn.com/news/storage/rubrik-ceo-gartner-data-center-magic-quadrant-seriously-flawed) . I've never seen a CEO do this without blowback Bipul again with a killer move.
   * TL:DR; They were making moves YEARS ago. See article excerpt below.

[This is pretty rare, vendors complain but not publishing a document read by 4k+ CIO controlling the flow of billions of dollars in a sector. It's just insane. There's a lot of big names backing them. ](https://preview.redd.it/x3hcumds365e1.png?width=1152&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f1e26b7a5f66134efaf4447b77fa18f020f0837)

* Their only publicly traded competitor is Commvault which is around $170 and dropping.
* Veeam and Cohesity are private firms with very different architectures, support qualities, and applications. Rubrik is the only one fully doing what it does. They are considered the “Lexus”

**How are they different?** 

* Rubrik views backup and recovery very differently from legacy vendors. They built their architecture based on expecting to get hacked (Backup & Recovery) vs. trying to prevent a hack (Incident Response). It's never been done ""their way"" before.
* Rubrik creates an air gapped layer on top of databases that - even if a hacker gets in they’re quarantined and the user can restore the system cutting them off. Thus less downtime, less support costs, payroll, legal fees, etc.
* They are very partner friendly with Mandiant, Crowdstrike, and Zscaler at least in the cutthroat cyber industry. 
* Rubrik’s leadership , in particular the CEO Bipul Sinha, are not run of the mill. Bipul is personally a very kind, measured, and calculated leader, I’ve met him before. He’s a lovely man but a killer. He’s an engineer with a sales streak like Elon. Bipul has Nutanix and Bromium under his belt. Google Him. He essentially came out of retirement for this company from a cushy ass VC job. 
* They know how to pitch investors, analysts, sales people, clients, basically everyone. They’re as buttoned up as you get and they come to impress. They earned their street cred 100%. 
* They have consistently ranked as #1 according to Gartner in the Magic Quadrant. Beating out companies with very, very large balance sheets that don't have the balls to IPO in 2024.

**Why the sudden pop? (Things I thought were important)** 

* Analysts needed another leap to profitability  due to the only available historicals  being from the April 2024 IPO and September Q2 earnings. This gave them pause on profitability as Rubrik as high operating margin.
* They raised 2025 Guidance. Indicated profitability by end of next year on this Q3 Earnings.
* Things I Heard on their Q3 Earnings today:
   * They mentioned a Fortune 50 Healthcare company selecting them in a competitive win. UnitedHealthcare was hacked in February and had offline billing systems for like 20 days. I’m thinking they signed UNH, that’s a big cookie boys. It’s super fucking hard to rip and replace a legacy vendor. 
   * They passed $1B in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR). This is a big metric. I heard both the Goldman Sachs and Barclays analysts say “Congrats” they seemed to be teeing up easier questions.   
* [Everyone and their mother in Cybersecurity has heard of Rubrik. They got the same award as Google, Facebook, and others a month ago for Entrepreneurship](https://www.rubrik.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/24/rubrik-named-the-2024-entrepreneurial-company-of-the-year-by-the-harvard-business-school-hbs-association-of-northern-california)

**Why did the stock not move from April to September 2024? (Timeline Below...)**

* **April 24th 2024 IPO Financials**
   *  Rubrik reveals a very high operating margin due to sales and marketing investments aka ripping out Zscaler’s sales team doing the “Salesforce” push. Blitzkreg the market. 
   * I believe they started  planning ripping Zscaler in October 2023 , it takes time to ramp up. They probably got all big sales hires in by March with a six month ramp up take lands sales quotes around September when the stock crept up(

   * [EDIT: (Updated with New Video) This lead to analyst skepticism about pricing controls. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzEhqtSrVUE) 
* **Septemeber 9th 2024 Q2 Earnings Financials** 
   * Earnings were month after the late July 2024 Crowdstrike hack, I do not think Rubrik was able to accelerate deal velocity to report ARR high enough to relieve market analysts and critics of the operating margin. They were asked about “deal velocity” by analysts today and it seems like the markets are pleased. 
   * [Bloomberg video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGvI0QbzzkY) from post-earnings is killer and a good recap of market sentiment.
   * [Rubrik Search Trends Peaked In April Coinciding With the Major UNH Hack; however, they droped off after the huge spike.](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=rubrik&hl=en)
      * I think analysts expected a quicker deal cycle around the UNH hack, 4 months/120 days is a very fast enterprise sales cycle. Most large sales deals can take 6-12 months if not longer.
* **October 2024:** 
   * I believe deal velocity picked up from the UNH hack and even with low search results, the three week hack fallout was enough to start sales cycles. Then from the Crowdstrike fallout, even as a partner, highlighted the need to immediately solve it as publicly traded companies were literally offline, no one working.
   * Remember 60-120 days is a very fast sales cycle on any software sale. I think this is where we started heating up here as this is three months out from the hack.  
   * Today on earnings analysts seemed eager to ask about profitability as the CFO and CEO were comfortable to voice the 2026 is the year. Look there's alot of tech companies with -40 EPS floating around. It's not 2013-2018 you can't float on negative earnings and millions of users. <--- the market is speaking, you have to make money as a tech company.
* **November 2024:** 
   * Rising cybersecurity risk from election, TikTok hack, etc. Fidelity even paused my money for four weeks in a CMA because they had security issues with fraud. 
   * Stock was ticking up.
* **December 4th, 2024  (Yesterday):**
   * Veeam $2B announcement mentioned earlier.
   * Volume doubles to nearly 2M. It was 700k in July 2024. It's 4M Today. Nuts.

**Where will it go?**

* It seem comparable to Zscaler and Commvault in valuation. I'm long on it and believe it'll push past $100 by July 2025.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h7s0om/rbrk_rubrik/,119,2024-12-06 04:27:11,"

Their arrival window is 3-4PM EST and this fucking jobs report, maybe a hard dip tomorrow who knows. I thought like $6.5 pump if earnings were good. Considering Cybersecurity has been very hit or miss recently on earnings. 

RIP my 12/27 $S $30C. I'M NOT FUCKING SELLING.; If it hits $80 by next week it’s at least a decent chunk but there are $500k-$1M accounts here so I’m a small fish. So maybe a year of income after taxes and I have a wife/baby. It’s for daycare not a new car. 

I told myself the options budget is $15k and you go from there.

I will buy Commvault when they turn down the screen brightness for these poor underpaid models. 

Additionally, what ""cutting edge"" company doesn't have dark mode for their users?; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259); okay my comparables are Zscaler, Commvault, and Crowdstrike. that's a range of $170-$340. 

![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883); In my experience acquistions always have a ""integration period"". Cohesity and Veritas, two other ""Top 5"" Players are merging together at the end of 2024. 

Getting two systems to work together, integrate two salesforce will be difficult. 

I should also mention Rubrik is 100% channel so they are the ones in the position to buy other companies and have a quicker TTR (Time-to-Revenue) a middle management circlejerk metric for feature and project efficiency. 

Rubrik does have sales people but they are responsible for growing channel partners. Kind of like Kraft or Nestle, they compete in selling endcaps and floor displays to Wal Mart who then sells to the customer.

I was just sitting here thinking about how the TA seems to show a good run to at least $80.

If you don’t mind, what would be some positions you’d take today for that potential run to 80-85 next week?; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258); ::gulps::; Just buy a couple shares and watch for the next few days. You have to make your own decisions , I am not providing advice but I will share my position. 

Spend like a couple hours watching interviews, looking at the majority investors and board. Then see what you want to do. Ask yourself do I understand the pitch and am I buying it? Then ask is the market buying it? 

I liked having cash flow to deploy over two weeks so I didn’t have to constantly buy and hold big chunks, I expected volatility. 

My percentage limit is now 10% on dips , Rubrik kissed -5% -6% but I watched the bid ask spread and these fuckers were playing footsie moving the spread from $1 to .50, it was very hard to buy anything right in the middle of the spread and the volume was 1/10th of what it was now. 

I am minimum holding everything through next week. I got fucking beat up for 5-6 trading days with the options. The stock was just 4-6xed in volume over the past two weeks. 

I need someone that trade PLTR or NVDA to chime in. 


IMO it’ll dip because it’s not the side wall of a rising cliff. I however am holding as much and long as possible.; This is amazing and I greatly appreciate your insight here! RBRK will be on my radar moving forward now. Enjoy those gains! I’m jelly and wish I’d see your post sooner 🤣."
161,What is your thought on my portfolio and strategy?,"I'm 30M. I recently started investing in ETF & individual stocks. Below is my portfolio I figured it out myself, but I am not sure if it is reasonable in the long run, and I want to hear other people's opinions, comments, and criticism on it. I put in a lump sum (a large amount of my saving money after I excluded emergency money) and plan to DCA monthly.

**ETF 75%**  
\- iShares Core MSCI World (Acc) - IWDA

**Individual stocks 25%**  
\- **Tech Growth 12%:** Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon, Palantir, Nvidia, Tesla  
\- **(High-)dividend 5%:** Siemens, Merck & Co, Swiss Re, Exxon Mobil, McDonald  
\- **Consumer defensive 3%:** UnitedHealth, Mastercard, Cola  
\- **Personal favorite 3.5%:** Garmin, Air Product and Chemicals, Walmart, Rolls-Royce, Airbus  
\- **Aerospace & Defensive 1.5%**: Rocket Lab, Howmet, RTX Corp

The reason that my portfolio contains more than 20 stocks is that I want to diversify it in terms of the stocks, not types of assets. 

My concerns/questions are:

1. I'm not sure if I hold too many stocks in the same category (e.g. tech stocks) and most of them are already covered by the IWDA ETF.
2. I'm also considering holding only 1 or 2 high-dividend stocks like AbbVie, instead of 5 dividend stocks. Is it a good idea?
3. My long-term plan follows ""time in the market > timing the market"". So I plan to split DCA in half and put in ETF and stocks equally. I also read about the [Enhanced DCA](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b40399/enhanced_dollar_cost_averaging/). Statistically, is the Enhanced DCA worth a try?

All suggestions are welcome. I'm happy to give more information and appreciate any help you can provide. :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h7mstv/what_is_your_thought_on_my_portfolio_and_strategy/,0,2024-12-06 00:13:24,"Honestly depends on how much you know about each company. Knowing those companies inside and out is arguably more valuable than not fully understanding a diversified single stock portfolio. I tend to do 40% in VOO, 10% in FTEC, 10% in FDIS, 5-10% in both Small and Mid-Cap ETFs (VOT and VB) and then everything else is technology because I know that the inside and out. I scrapped dividend stocks because I’m not sure where I’ll be able to write off long-term investment gains down the road in life (I’m 29) and don’t want to pay taxes on those dividends now. With that being said, a set of corporate bonds may be wise to make things more conservative (SPHY).; Isn't that holding too many ETFs a bad idea?; I would argue the opposite. Far less risk. Less reward, but unless you spend day and night researching the individual stocks, you likely won’t beat the ETF."
162,TSMC in talks with Nvidia for AI chip production in Arizona,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is in discussions with Nvidia Corp to produce its Blackwell artificial intelligence chips at the contract manufacturer's new plant in Arizona, three sources familiar with the matter said.

TSMC is already making preparations to start production early next year, the sources said.

Nvidia's Blackwell chips, which the company unveiled in March, have so far been manufactured at TSMC's facilities in Taiwan. The company has seen high demand from customers involved in generative AI and accelerated computing for the chips, which it says is 30 times speedier at tasks like serving up answers from chatbots.

The agreement, if finalised, would secure another customer for TSMC's Arizona facility, which is scheduled to start volume production next year.

TSMC and Nvidia declined to comment. The sources did not want to be identified as the talks were confidential.

Two of the sources said Apple (AAPL) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are current customers at the Arizona plant. Apple and AMD did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

However, while TSMC plans to produce the front-end process of Nvidia's Blackwell chips in Arizona, the chips will still need to be shipped back to Taiwan for packaging. The Arizona facility does not have chip on wafer on substrate (CoWoS) capacity that is essential to the Blackwell chips, two of the sources said.

All of TSMC's CoWoS capacity is currently in Taiwan.

Taiwan's TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, is investing tens of billions of dollars in building three facilities in Phoenix and the project has won significant subsidies from the U.S. government which wants to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States.

They are often refereed to ass the 'Silicone Shield'; Isn't Blackwell 4nm?  So it cannot be produced here yet?; Imports getting taxed higher leading to production coming to America? Which part is unclear?; well, apparently tsmc disagree with you. airzona plants are design to produce 3nm to 5nm, with engineer directly import from tsmc advance lab. you think they dont know better, why do you think they ask Nvidia to be their first customer if they cant do it lol.; 1. There are no tariffs because he isn’t president yet.

2.  This has been in the works long long long before the election night.

3.  Constantly being on your knees is bad for your circulation.; You said 3 and 5 originally - not 3 to 5.; [removed]; if you can produce up to 3nm, what make you think you cant produce 4nm lol. its a sub node; They were scaling up production for a while tbh and given the growing demand that's not surprising.

Also, we are talking about Trump. While no doubt anyone in charge factored him into the decision, the odds of him following through with anything are 50/50; this was most likely going to happen either way.; I am not an expert - that's why I asking the questions. But if you felt to need to lol, in was on your own error, lol."
163,Tesla: Unveiling the Overvaluation—A Comprehensive Analysis. Short Seller Report. (TSLA) Stock Equity Investing,"Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) has emerged as one of the most polarizing entities in contemporary financial history, boasting a market capitalization surpassing the combined worth of established automakers such as Toyota, Ford, and General Motors. Although the company has undeniably transformed the automotive and energy sectors, our analysis indicates that Tesla's valuation is driven by speculative enthusiasm rather than enduring fundamentals.

This report highlights substantial concerns regarding Tesla's financial performance, competitive positioning, and speculative projects such as the Optimus robot. Utilizing a macroeconomic perspective, it incorporates the Buffett Indicator and Shiller P/E Ratio to position Tesla within a broader market bubble. Our analysis concludes that Tesla is overvalued by nearly every metric, presenting a strong case for re-evaluating investment in the company.

**Disconnect from Fundamentals** P/E and Market Multiples 

Tesla's valuation metrics are inflated to speculative levels, outpacing both its peers and historical precedents: 

**Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio (TTM):** Tesla’s Price-to-Earnings stands at **94.55**, far above the automotive industry average of 5-15. For context, NVIDIA (a high-growth tech company) trades at 62x, and Apple, with its mature, stable business model, trades at 30x. Even against leading tech companies, Tesla’s P/E ratio is disproportionately high. 

**Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio:** Tesla trades at 8.95x sales, while Toyota and Ford hover below 1x. By comparison, NVIDIA’s P/S is approximately 16x, justified by its dominance in high-margin, rapidly expanding AI markets. Tesla’s lower-margin automotive business does not command the same pricing power or scalability, making its P/S ratio harder to justify. 

**Enterprise Value to EBITDA:** Tesla’s EV/EBITDA: 81.72, significantly higher than traditional automakers like GM (\~7x) and Toyota (\~6x). 

Tech Companies EV/EBITDA: 

* NVIDIA (NVDA): \~41x (Q4 2024), driven by its dominance in AI and GPUs. 
* Apple (AAPL): \~24x (Q4 2024), reflecting its mature, high-margin ecosystem.

These valuations assume extraordinary growth and profitability far beyond what Tesla has demonstrated or is likely to achieve given intensifying competitive pressures and technological limitations. 

**Current Market Cap to GDP Ratio**: The Buffett Indicator stands at **208%**, indicating an extreme overvaluation of the U.S. stock market. Tesla’s significant influence within major indices intensifies this systemic risk.

**Shiller P/E Ratio Current S&P 500 CAPE:** At 36.5, the CAPE ratio is nearing levels seen before the dot-com bust and 1929 crash. Tesla’s inflated valuation amplifies the broader market distortion. 

**Financial Performance Analysis** 

Revenue Growth Deceleration Tesla’s revenue growth trajectory is losing momentum: Annual Growth Decline: From **51.35% in 2022 to 18.8%** **in 2023**. Quarterly Revenue Stagnation: Q3 2024 revenue of $25.18 billion represents a sequential decline of 1.25%. **Margin Compression** Tesla's once-dominant margins are eroding under competitive and operational pressures: **Gross Margin:** Dropped to **18.25%** in 2023, reflecting price cuts and rising input costs. **Operating Margin**: Declined to **9.19%**, signaling inefficiencies in scaling operations.

Tesla's profitability is heavily reliant on high-margin regulatory credit sales. Regulatory Credit Dependency Tesla earned $1.78 billion from regulatory credits in 2023, representing 1.8% of revenue but an outsized share of net income. As traditional automakers ramp up EV production, the demand for Tesla's credits will wane, threatening this vital income stream. 

Policy Risk: Potential deregulation under a new administration, such as Donald Trump’s rollback of EV mandates, could eliminate this revenue entirely. 

Free Cash Flow Volatility Annual **Free Cash Flow (FCF)**: Declined by **42.38%** YoY to $4.36 billion in 2023. CapEx Expansion: **Capital expenditures** surged to **$3.5 billion in Q3 2024**, reflecting heavy investments with uncertain ROI. 

Competitive Positioning: Eroding Leadership Market Share Under Siege Tesla’s once-dominant EV market share is eroding as competitors scale production: 

* BYD (China): Outpaced Tesla in global EV sales with a diversified, cost-efficient lineup. 
* Ford and GM (U.S.): Successfully launching competitive models like the F-150 Lightning and Chevy Bolt EUV. 

Volkswagen Group (Europe): Scaling production of the ID series to challenge Tesla in key markets. Limited Product Lineup Tesla offers only four primary models: Model S, 3, X, and Y. Delays in the Cybertruck and Tesla Semi have limited its ability to address growing demand for EV trucks and commercial vehicles. 

**Technological Limitations: The Autonomy Gap** 

Tesla's reliance on a Level 2 autonomous system, marketed as ""Full Self-Driving"" (FSD), raises significant safety concerns. Unlike its competitors, Tesla has faced public scrutiny and legal challenges over a troubling number of fatalities and accidents associated with its Autopilot and FSD systems. Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) system is limited to **SAE Level 2**, requiring constant driver supervision. Despite its branding as ""Full Self-Driving,"" Tesla's system lags behind competitors who are deploying higher levels of autonomy. Competitors Advancing in Autonomy 

* Waymo (**Alphabet**): Operating **Level 4** autonomous vehicles in urban and suburban environments, Waymo leverages a robust sensor suite, including lidar, radar, and cameras, to achieve safe, driverless navigation. 
   * Despite millions of miles driven in autonomous mode, Waymo has not reported any fatal accidents involving its vehicles. The company’s use of lidar, radar, and stringent testing protocols prioritizes safety above all else.
*  Cruise (**General Motors**): Similarly deploying **Level 4** autonomous vehicles, Cruise has demonstrated fully driverless operations in cities like San Francisco and Phoenix. 
   * Similarly, Cruise operates its autonomous fleet in complex urban environments without any recorded fatalities. Rigorous validation and oversight underpin its commitment to safety. 

**Mercedes-Benz**: Achieved **Level 3** autonomy, allowing drivers to disengage under specific conditions, and is actively scaling this capability in key markets like Germany.

* As a pioneer in achieving Level 3 autonomy, Mercedes-Benz adheres to strict European safety standards. The company has not been implicated in fatal incidents linked to its autonomous technology. 

**Tesla's Refusal to Adopt Lidar**: A Strategic Misstep Lidar, a gold standard for environmental perception in autonomous vehicles, is absent from Tesla’s sensor suite. While Tesla relies solely on cameras and neural networks, this approach limits its ability to detect objects with the precision and reliability required for higher levels of autonomy. Lidar offers redundancy and reliability in adverse conditions, such as poor weather or low visibility. Tesla’s omission of lidar raises safety and regulatory risks. 

Regulatory Roadblocks: Tesla's current system may struggle to meet the stringent safety standards required for **Level 4 or 5 autonomy**. The Business Model Constraint Tesla's refusal to adopt lidar is not solely technological—it is economic. Adding lidar would dramatically **increase production costs**, undermining Tesla’s ability to maintain competitive pricing in a margin-sensitive market. 

Cost Implications: The inclusion of lidar could add $1,000 to $2,000 per vehicle in hardware costs alone, compressing Tesla’s **already declining gross margins**. 

Reliance on Low Costs: Tesla’s market position **depends on producing vehicles at a relatively low cost**. Embracing lidar and other advanced sensors would necessitate higher vehicle prices or **reduced profitability**—both untenable given Tesla’s current valuation pressures. Tesla Will Struggle to Deliver a High-Quality, Level 5 Vehicle Tesla’s business model prioritizes cost efficiency over technological advancement. This approach limits Tesla’s ability to compete with high-quality offerings from rivals like Mercedes-Benz and Waymo. This makes the realization of a Level 5 fully autonomous vehicle—the holy grail of autonomy—highly unlikely in the foreseeable future. While also ensuring Tesla will continue to deliver lower-quality vehicles compared to competitors who balance advanced technology with rigorous quality standards. Tesla's technological and economic constraints reveal a fundamental flaw in its autonomy strategy. While competitors like Waymo, Cruise, and Mercedes-Benz lead the charge toward true self-driving vehicles, Tesla remains limited by its cost-driven model, prioritizing affordability over technological robustness. This gap will only widen as regulatory demands for safety and precision increase, further eroding Tesla’s competitive edge in the autonomy race. 

**Speculative Ventures: The Optimus Robot and Financial Impossibilities** Tesla’s foray into humanoid robotics through the Optimus project exemplifies speculative spending on unproven technologies. While CEO Elon Musk has branded Optimus as a revolutionary product that will transform industries, the financial and technological hurdles are insurmountable given Tesla’s existing commitments. 

Development Stage: Early and Unimpressive Current Optimus prototypes remain far from market ready. Demonstrations reveal robots controlled remotely, lacking the autonomy necessary to perform even basic tasks reliably. Musk has claimed Optimus will perform functions ranging from warehouse labor to elder care, yet no substantial evidence supports the viability of this vision in the near term. 

Competition: Boston Dynamics’ Atlas Robot: Years ahead in functionality and autonomy, Atlas showcases capabilities like complex navigation, load handling, and task performance, including construction-related activities. Tesla lags far behind established players like Boston Dynamics, whose decades-long focus on robotics has yielded tangible results. 

Optimus, in its current form, appears more akin to a marketing spectacle than a functional product. 

Tesla’s ability to deliver a viable Optimus robot, while maintaining profitability and fulfilling its other ambitious promises (such as Level 5 autonomy), faces significant financial constraints: 

**High Production Costs**: The estimated Bill of Materials (BOM) for Optimus is $50,000-$60,000 per unit, with components like robotic hands costing upwards of $10,000 alone. Scaling production to mass-market levels without compromising profitability would require unprecedented efficiency improvements, which Tesla has not demonstrated in its automotive business. 

Lack of Focus: Tesla is already grappling with **slowing vehicle sales**, **declining margins**, and the **high capital expenditure needed for its core EV business**. Simultaneously pursuing **Level 5 autonomy** and **humanoid robotics** is **financially and operationally unsustainable**. The Conflict Between FSD, Vehicles, and Optimus Tesla’s current valuation assumes success across multiple frontiers—producing low-cost vehicles, achieving full Level 5 autonomy, and scaling humanoid robotics. However, these goals are mutually exclusive given Tesla’s financial and technical limitations.

Level 5 Autonomy Challenges: Achieving this milestone requires heavy investment in lidar or other advanced sensor technologies that Tesla has eschewed to preserve margins. Without these investments, FSD remains stuck at Level 2, far behind competitors. 

Vehicle Profitability Risks: Tesla relies on cutting costs in its automotive production to maintain competitiveness. **Diverting resources** to **Optimus** would further strain vehicle **margins** and **reduce its ability to compete** in the increasingly crowded EV market. Successfully building Optimus at scale would demand massive R&D expenditures, high production costs, and extensive testing—placing further pressure on Tesla’s finances. 

Financial Risks to Shareholders Elon Musk’s vision for Optimus, paired with Tesla’s ongoing promises of Level 5 autonomy and affordable EVs, creates a trifecta of expectations that cannot be achieved simultaneously.

Investor Dilution Risk: Funding these speculative ventures may necessitate raising capital, diluting shareholder equity further. **Profitability at Risk**: Optimus development would drain resources needed to maintain Tesla’s **fragile profit margins**, which have already been compressed to **18.25%** **gross** margin in 2023. Credibility Concerns: Years of missed deadlines on promises like Level 5 autonomy raise doubts about Tesla’s ability to deliver on Musk’s bold claims, tarnishing investor confidence over time. **Tesla’s Optimus robot is emblematic of the company’s speculative spending and overpromised vision.** The inherent financial impossibilities of simultaneously scaling Optimus, achieving Level 5 autonomy, and maintaining vehicle profitability underscore a fundamental flaw in Tesla’s business strategy. 

Unlike its competitors, Tesla is spread too thin, risking operational focus, financial stability, and shareholder value. As Musk continues to promise breakthroughs, **the gap between reality and rhetoric only widens, making Tesla’s lofty ambitions increasingly untenable.** Operational Challenges Quality Control Issues Tesla continues to face manufacturing defects and recalls: High Recall Rate: Frequent recalls, including software glitches and mechanical failures, have raised concerns about **production quality.** Customer Complaints: Limited-service centers and long repair times **undermine Tesla’s brand reputation**. Tesla’s competitors have prioritized safety, employing rigorous testing, comprehensive sensor suites (including lidar), and conservative rollout strategies. This stark contrast underscores the risks of Tesla’s cost-cutting approach: **Inventory Build-Up** Tesla’s days of inventory increased to **28 days** in Q3 2024, suggesting weakening demand relative to production levels. 

Tesla has historically been a leader in electric vehicle (EV) battery technology, notably with its high energy density and efficient thermal management systems. However, competitors are rapidly advancing, challenging Tesla's dominance in this critical area. Competitors' Advances in Battery Technology 

* BYD's Blade Battery: BYD's Blade Battery utilizes lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry, offering enhanced safety and longevity. Its thin, blade-like design allows for higher energy density and improved space utilization within the vehicle. 
* CATL's Qilin Battery: Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL) has developed the Qilin battery, which boasts a record-breaking volume utilization efficiency of 72% and an energy density of up to 255 Wh/kg. This enables longer driving ranges and faster charging times. 
* Solid-State Batteries: Companies like Toyota are investing in solid-state battery technology, which promises higher energy density, faster charging, and improved safety over traditional lithium-ion batteries. 

Tesla's introduction of the 4680 battery cells aims to **reduce costs** and improve vehicle range. These cells are larger and designed to be integrated into the vehicle's structure, enhancing efficiency. However, **production challenges have delayed their widespread implementation**, allowing competitors to narrow the technological gap. 

**Impact of Rising Lithium Prices** The EV industry is heavily reliant on lithium, a critical component in battery production. Recent trends indicate a significant increase in lithium prices due to supply constraints and escalating demand. **Lithium carbonate prices have surged, reaching unprecedented levels.** This escalation is attributed to the rapid growth in EV adoption and limited expansion in lithium extraction and processing capacities. Supply Constraints: The **International Energy Agency (IEA) warns of potential lithium shortages by 2025**, which could hinder the scaling of EV production globally. Implications for Tesla Cost Pressures: **Rising lithium prices directly impact battery production costs**. For Tesla, which aims to produce mass-market EVs at competitive prices, these **cost increases** could **compress profit margins** or necessitate higher vehicle prices, potentially reducing demand. 

Tesla's ambitious production targets may be jeopardized by lithium supply bottlenecks, leading to potential delays in vehicle deliveries and an inability to meet market demand. While Tesla remains a significant player in the EV market, its lead in battery technology is being challenged by competitors' innovations. Coupled with the financial pressures from rising lithium prices and potential supply shortages, Tesla faces substantial challenges in maintaining its competitive edge and profitability in the evolving EV landscape. 

**Legal and Regulatory Risks** 

* **Autopilot Investigations**: Multiple NHTSA probes into Autopilot-related accidents could result in costly recalls or fines. 
* **Misleading Marketing Claims:** Lawsuits alleging false advertising of Tesla’s FSD capabilities pose reputational and financial risks. Tesla’s valuation is built on speculative optimism that diverges significantly from its financial and operational realities. The company faces a convergence of critical challenges: 
* **Slowing Revenue Growth and Margin Compression**: Revenue growth has decelerated, while declining gross and operating margins highlight the financial strain of maintaining competitive pricing amidst rising costs. 
* **Reliance on Unsustainable Revenue Streams**: Regulatory credit sales, a key driver of profitability, are vulnerable to policy changes and decreasing demand as competitors ramp up EV production. 
* **Technological and Strategic Constraints**: Tesla’s Level 2 autonomy lags far behind competitors like Waymo and Cruise, who have deployed Level 4 solutions. The company’s refusal to adopt lidar reflects cost-driven compromises that limit its ability to achieve higher levels of safety and autonomy. 
* **Speculative Ventures:** The Optimus robot project exemplifies Tesla’s foray into high-risk, unproven technologies. Building and scaling Optimus while pursuing Level 5 autonomy and maintaining profitability is financially and operationally implausible. 
* **Eroding Market Position**: Tesla’s dominance in the EV market is waning, with competitors like BYD, Volkswagen, and GM offering cost-effective and innovative alternatives that threaten Tesla’s market share. 
* **Safety and Reputational Risks**: Fatalities linked to Tesla’s Autopilot underscore the dangers of overpromising and underdelivering, contrasting sharply with the safer, more transparent approaches of competitors. 
* **Challenges in Battery Technology**: While Tesla has historically led in battery innovation, competitors like BYD, CATL, and Toyota are closing the gap with advanced technologies like the Blade and Qilin batteries, as well as solid-state innovations. Production delays and scaling issues with Tesla’s 4680 cells further erode its competitive edge. 
* **Rising Costs of Key Commodities**: The surge in lithium prices and potential shortages of critical materials like cobalt and nickel threaten to increase production costs and compress margins. For Tesla, which relies on aggressive pricing to sustain demand, this adds a significant financial burden. 
* **Macro indicators such as the Buffett Indicator (208% of GDP) and the Shiller P/E Ratio (36.5)** place Tesla’s valuation within the context of broader market overvaluation, further amplifying the risk of a correction. 

Tesla’s ability to sustain its valuation assumes simultaneous success in producing low-cost vehicles, achieving Level 5 autonomy, and scaling speculative projects like Optimus—all while maintaining profitability and navigating intensifying competition. This multifaceted challenge is not only improbable but also exposes shareholders to significant downside risk. 

As competitors advance technologically, diversify product offerings, and secure more efficient supply chains, Tesla’s vulnerabilities become increasingly evident. Combined with macroeconomic pressures and systemic overvaluation, Tesla’s stock is poised for significant correction, making it a high-risk holding for investors.

Great article and thanks for putting it here.

I agree with some of your points here but disagree with others. Are you open to me just pointing out where I disagree so we can have a conversation to maybe reevaluate your position?

1. PE, PS, EBITDA: as many would also point out, Tesla is a tech company, not a car company. Its major tech advancement is the embodiment of AI. Which is also in the AI industry. Moreover It has businesses that has a high profit margin, such as sunroof and ev charging. Although I do agree 120 PE is pretty high.

2. FSD: I think they’re on the same level. Either all L2, or all L4. Regulatory risk is low due to the alignment with politics. 

3. LiDAR: I don’t think this is an issue. AI FSD is best used with cameras. LiDAR is redundant. Hence the following claims about prices are not really an issue either.

4. Optimus: Not sure if R&D in Optimus is a good thing or bad thing. It keeps the narrative going and the expectation justifies the price. Viewing it as purely bad might be a bit biased."
164,17 year old looking for some long term investment ideas,"This is not my first rodeo with the stock market, I've been trading since 2020 (13), and the only two major long term investments that I have is Apple and VTI, both serving me greatly. I would consider Rivian to also be a long term stock, but it is more risky than the other two. My portfolio mainly consists of Tech stocks as for it is a market I am actively participating in and informed about, but I'm open to broadening markets. 

I was either planning on dumping more money into VTI, however as it reached $300 It became a bit too expensive for me to want to invest more in. Something I'm more concerned about is a crash, especially in the tech market as for it is reaching all time highs, but from what the tech market has shown in the past decade, is UP with some downs obviously. I know VOO and other vanguard ETF's are shown to do really well, but most of them are expensive, but in the end it may just be worth it.

165,MDA Space $MDALF is profitable and will possibly be trading in the US Stock market soon,"This great Canadian Space sector company ( [https://mda.space](https://mda.space) ) has a beautiful chart showing their growth and is profitable. They have market cap of 3.2 Billion. What do they do?

MDA Space is a technology and services company that provides advanced solutions to the global space industry:

* **Geointelligence**: Uses satellite data and imagery for climate change monitoring, national security, and global commerce
* **Robotics & Space Operations**: Provides autonomous robotics and vision sensors for space exploration
* **Satellite Systems**: Provides spacecraft and systems for space-based services, including broadband internet connectivity 

MDA Space has a history of firsts and over 450 missions. They have been providing operational readiness support for the International Space Station's (ISS) Mobile Servicing System since 2001. They are also known for delivering large-scale robotic systems, such as Canadarm2.

And this excerpt from a post by user manolo44 sure is bullish:

""Their earnings report was stellar: growth of 38% yoy, it is actually **PROFITABLE** \- none of the other space companies are profitable - profitability with adjusted EBITDA of $55.5 million, up 30% YoY, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.7%, net income up 60% yoy, and net debt adjusted EBITDA ratio of just 0.8x (so zero risk of dilution). However, post earnings the stock was mostly flat. Why? Their reported backlog was unchanged from previous quarter report (backlog is 4.6B btw).

But if any of you folks had bothered to tune in to the call, you would have heard the CEO say that it is a fact that by year end they will be **definitely be signing a new contract worth 750M** – of these, only 300M is recorded in backlog – a**n additional $450M is going to be added** upon finalization and t**his will happen by year’s end.** They in fact stated during the Q&A that they are confident they will be finishing 2024 with $5B backlog. They also said MDA’s satellite systems division alone has a $**15B+ pipeline** of potential projects, thanks to its Aurora-class satellites tailored for low Earth orbit  constellations.

 MDA is building a new 185,000 sq. ft. facility in Quebec, **capable of producing two satellites per day** starting in late 2025.""

And then I heard this:

MDA Space, which is a sleeping giant merely because it trades in the Toronto Stock Exchange rather than US, is exploring listing in the US, according to comments by its CEO;

“Management suggested that it continues to explore a potential dual stock listing in the U.S.""

Now I am not sure how a dual listing will effect my 500 MDALF shares but if I had to guess I would say it will be a good thing.

There have been posts on Reddit about how bad of a company they are to their employees, but just like Yelp you usually only hear about the bad apples, not the good ones, so I take that with a grain of salt.

---

**Ticker:** MDALF (MDA Space Ltd.)

**Direction:** Up

**Prognosis:** Strong Buy

**Reasoning:** Profitable Canadian space company with significant growth, large backlog, potential for US listing, and analyst upgrades.  CEO stated a new $750M contract coming soon.


**Bonus:**  Makes two satellites a day by late 2025 (!!)

**Caveat:** Some negative employee reviews online.; This is one of my highest conviction plays on small cap stocks. Huge revenue growth, huge earnings growth, margin expansion, large pipeline of new products and contracts, and decades of success as a space manufacturer. 

Dual listing on a US exchange opens them up to billions of dollars in new investment from funds that are bullish on space and have very few public options. Any pullbacks are generational buying opportunities imo. 

Not that they’re directly comparable, but RKLB is one of the few other publicly traded space companies that even has revenue. MDA market cap  is 80% cheaper, while having double the revenue, net profitability, higher margins, and more government contracts in backlog. Just food for thought. 

Disclaimer: I own ~1,000 shares that I’ve been buying every few months since IPO. Also owned MAXR in the past who spun off MDA in 2020; I have been watching this but have had money tied up in other things; I didn't read any of that shit, do they make Molly?  RFK makes this very bullish if they make Molly.; Some more good news and recognition today:

Im not too worried about tariffs as they are more like negociation leverage tactics and arent a plain % numbers for everything. There are always many exceptions and different tariffs. 

Being in a space race again, im confident tariffs wont be applied on things that could benefit the us.; agreed.

 if it dips lower near market close I will be buying more.; actually once I started buying stocks that had charts like MDALF I realized it was because the company was healthy and revenues were increasing. Before I would buy companies that had charts that looked like this one, hoping that I timed the bottom correctly, and would be surprised when the it didnt go my way.

166,SCHG vs. SPLG vs. SCHD: Too Much Overlap?,"I’m considering these ETFs for my portfolio: SCHG (growth stocks), SPLG (broad S&P 500), and SCHD (dividend/value focus). I’m worried about overlap—here’s what I’ve found:
	
•	SCHG vs. SPLG: High overlap (~30%-40%) due to shared large-cap growth names like Apple and Microsoft. SPLG is broader but tech-heavy.
	
•	SCHG vs. SCHD: Minimal overlap. SCHG is growth-focused, while SCHD avoids most tech in favor of dividend payers like Pepsi and Coke.
	
•	SPLG vs. SCHD: Moderate overlap; both hold large-cap dividend stocks but differ in sector balance.

What’s your take? Worth holding all three, or are two enough?",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h6qxo7/schg_vs_splg_vs_schd_too_much_overlap/,3,2024-12-04 21:56:00,"There is a lot of overlap, but if you want to invest in multiple it can be done as a method of risk shifting or volatility shifting or whatever it's called (Tilting?). So like if SCHG is too hot, but SCHD is too cold, you can mix them together. Or maybe SPLG would be juuuuust right (I actually get SCHB).; Overlap isn't bad, it might even increase gains.  Naked qqq outperforms most diverse ports.

That said i personally have QQA, SDY, DGRW

QQA: aggressive,  risky tech dividend

SDY: defensive industrial dividend 

DGRW: diverse blend,  sp500 type dividend


With this setup you have a huge variety of sectors, from tech to finance to candy to steel and oil.  For more gains allocate more to qqa. For even more riskier gains get BITO bitcoin etf it pays dividends; So there is a lot of overlap but it wouldn’t necessarily hurt to hold all 3?; I don't think so. Just makes your list longer and your taxes more complicated."

169,Investment Advice- Rebalancing?,"I am looking for some advice on my current portfolio and savings plan.

I'm a fairly recent immigrant to this country (36m) so started my retirement/ savings from scratch in my early 30's. Currently live in a very HCOL city on the west coast, making around 100-150k/ year running my own business as an S corp, where I pay myself a W2 salary thats roughly 60% of my income, which i adjust regularly to stay ahead of taxes. The nature of my work is project based and freelance so every month is different. This year I am paying myself approx 6k gross per month on w2. The remainder of the income from the business and other 1099 income I usually manage to write off completely as I invest it back into the business.

My main expense is rent and utilities, other than that I have no other debt (paid off car, no student debt) aside from small credit card bills (under 3k that I pay off monthly- no interest)

  
**Current Accounts and Savings:**

  
Personal Checking Account- $3k, keep this empty for monthly expenses only. Zero interest. I view this as a pass through account- salary in, bills out.

Business Checking Account- $20k, this account fluctuates a lot depending on cash flow, I usually try to keep it around $20k- thinking I could/ should move at least 50% into an account that accrues some interest. 

SEP IRA (Deductible)- 25k, I max out the contribution yearly, 25% of my w2 income (started this in 2022) I divide that total amount by 12 and make 12 monthly DCA buys into VTI. That's it. Could possibly just start dropping a lump sum?

ROTH IRA- 18k, Maxing this out every year. $500 monthly DCA buys into VTI (50%) VOO (40%) and 10% cash.

M1 Investment Account- $3k, started this is March of this year to start putting some money into some individual stocks and slightly more speculative plays. $100 weekly DCA buys into a basket of stocks MSTR, TSLA, NVDA, AMZN, AAPL, V, LLY  etc. I like to own individual names and regular DCA just keeps the guesswork out.

Regular Brokerage Account- $1.5k, use this for the occasional weekly/ monthly option contract. Any gains over 1.5k just get emptied into the ROTH. I regularly generate 400-500 per month from this account, so most months i don't even need to fund my ROTH from my personal account.

Chase Investment Account- $14k, $400 monthly contribtions, this was a Chase Auto Invest account (mid risk) that yielded about 10%, so below avg market returns. Chase has ended this auto investment service so the money is 80% invested into various funds but the new contributions will just be cash unless i Manually buy new funds. As this has been underperforming the market, i'm thinking about splitting this up over a few of my other accounts to streamline.

  
Crypto- $20k, been buying $100 of BTC weekly for years. Occasionally add bigger lumps on big dips. Will continue this DCA strategy.

  
So my currently contributions to all my accounts are :

  
SEP IRA- 1k monthly DCA into VTI  
ROTH IRA- $500 monthly DCA into VTI/ VOO  
M1- $400 monthly DCA into various QQQ type stocks  
Chase Invest- $400 monthly DCA into money market  
Crypto- $400 DCA into BTC  


I don't really ever sell stocks or funds, unless they become seriously overweight, or I need the cash, which hasn't happened so far.

I'm fairly happy with the amount that I am able to save and invest monthly, just wondering if anyone had advice on how I could streamline this approach, or if there are other account types or assets I should consider. The monthly DCA strategy just works for me because it means I really don't worry too much about market movements, I actually prefer to see prices go down so i can buy more cheaper. 

TLDR: Please critique my current investment strategy, are there any other account types i should be contributing to regularly to build wealth for the future and how could i manage my regular buys/ DCA/ contributions more effectively?",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h5wads/investment_advice_rebalancing/,0,2024-12-03 20:49:45,
170,"Apple's stock price hits a new high, recapturing the number one spot in market cap. Is a new 'super product cycle' on the horizon?","**As 2025 approaches, the countdown is on for the release of a number of new Apple products. According to reports, Apple will bring a series of anticipated new products in the spring of 2025, covering a number of popular product lines such as the iPhone SE, iPad and MacBook Air. Are investors ready for a new “super cycle”?**

  
**Monday, $ Apple (AAPL.US)$ closed up 0.95%, shares rose to $ 239.59, hitting a new record high, the total market capitalization exceeded 3.62 trillion U.S. dollars, regaining the first global market value throne, compared with the second place of the NVIDIA has been higher than 250 billion U.S. dollars. This year, Apple's cumulative increase of 25.06%.**

It is worth noting that since April this year, Apple's share price ushered in a sustained rise, has risen more than 45% over the closing low point on April 19 this year. The strong performance of Apple's stock price not only reflects the company's growth momentum, but also shows investors' confidence in its future development. What are the driving factors behind this upward trend?

  
Outstanding earnings performance. In the fourth fiscal quarter, when the new generation of iPhones just hit the market, the revenue of Apple's core product, iPhone, returned to positive growth, and the growth momentum exceeded Wall Street's expectations, driving the company's total revenue to a record high for the same period. The solid financial situation undoubtedly provides investors with confidence.

Technology innovation and AI strategic layout. While the core products are changing, Apple is also launching new products, from Apple Watch to smart home products, to meet the diversified needs of consumers. In addition, Apple's continued expansion in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence has laid the foundation for its future growth with the gradual release of Apple's AI capabilities.

Global market expansion. Apple's sales revenue in Europe, Japan and other Asia-Pacific regions outside of China and Japan all accelerated in the fourth fiscal quarter, such as India, Southeast Asia and Africa, which have low smartphone penetration rates and huge market potential, are also growing rapidly. At the same time, Apple is also promoting the relocation of the industrial chain, especially to emerging markets such as India, with a view to further reducing costs, expanding production capacity and developing new market growth points.

[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse); After that apple update on the Photos app, Apple should be down 99%. I hate it now; https://preview.redd.it/7b8e29a9ho4e1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7271d9253fe379baa3f15cfcc361c6c771748e40

Another 5% more to go; lol idiots here thinking apple will go down can keep coping. Dip gets bought every time and pretty much every 401k has a percentage going into apple; Airpods can now double as hearing aids. Theres a christmas ad going around.

It’s going up from running a buyback program in a low-volume market, with holders not wanting to sell this tax year. Really don’t see this as a long-term buy anywhere over 200, maybe even 160 really; [removed]; Apple $500 EOY, to the moon!!!!; Bought it at 120 and sold at 140 when I thought it was overpriced, fuck me; Where's that dude who bet the farm against apple a month ago or so? Let's see the loss porn buddy!; I've not been impressed by apple products since Steve Jobs died. Jobs was the idea guy that pushed innovation and the revolutionary tech explosion at Apple. Tim Cook that succeeded Jobs is a fantastic CEO - but he is about as creative as a pet rock. They need a new Rockstar idea guy to set them onto the next ipod/ iPad/ iPhone... cause simply releasing the same product with a few dozen more megapixels in the camera lense every 16 months ain't moving the needle; $1,000,000 eoy. Do your research. /s; No; Hopefully all the PE ratio bears didn’t follow buffet into selling their portfolios; It’s only up cause I sold.; can't imagine a super cycle is on the horizon. that last one was a perfect storm of China allowing Apple into it's market. there's no catalyst like that coming up.; Apple's stock price is another classic example of the highly over valued American Stock market. As if there are no downside risks and it's huge profit margin will only improve further. 

By definition a company is never able to earn more than its turnover. But costs will never be 0, so in reality profit margins can't come close to 100% of a companies' turnover. That means companies with a very strong market position and high profit margins mainly increase their profits by increasing turnovers. Growth of turnovers is organisation wise limited though. Very few companies manage to increase their turnovers by over 25-30% on average for 5 to 10 consecutive years. 

That all being said, valuations of over 3 times turnovers are an indication of speculation. The turnover of Apple only increased 2% this year, and even dropped almost 3% last year. So profit growth was mainly because of cost cutting and improved profit margins. Apple trades at 9 times turnovers, 3 times the above mentioned 3 times turnover ceiling of rational valuation. The only way the current valuations would be justified is when its profit would increase at least 30% next year again. Without significant growth of turnover this would mean a further increase of profit levels to around 35% of turnover. The next year it should go to close to 50% profit margin then. It is simply not making any rational sense.

Then there are the real risks:

1 increased competition. Over 30% of Apple's turnover is  outside America, Europe and Japan. Huawei is developing its own Operating System and does have the full support of the authorities in China. This might become a serious competitor in the coming years especially outside the USA.

2 Vulnerability of Apple's production and supply chain. Most Apple products are still manufactured in China with many Chinese parts. In case of further disruption of Chinese-American relations this is very vulnerable.

3 the largest opportunities for sales growth are in emerging markets like India, Indonesia and other South East Asian countries. But Apple's products are way more expensive than competitors products and in many of these markets and anti-china sentiment is absent or much weaker than in the USA.; I cashed out in late May to pay for my honeymoon.

[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/pe-ratio](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/pe-ratio)

Personally I don't really consider the pre-iPhone era relevant because that was a very different company that was struggling in the PC market. But I'll give it to you there have been points in Apple's 50 year history where PE has been higher. For example, during the massive dot com bust tech recession.; Ignore valuation at your own peril fam.

For me it's not a matter of if it's a matter of when the reversion to the mean happens. Apple simply doesn't have the revenue and earnings growth to support it's outsized valuation. That's an unnecessary gamble IMO. No reason to be overweight Apple right now when you can just buy the tech index and have reasonable exposure to Apple. There's been a flight to safety in mega cap tech the last couple years due to uncertainty about the economy with high inflation. When the economic outlook improves I think we'll see a rotation out of overvalued mega cap tech into everything else.

Personally, I don't think Vision Pro will be a hit and we are already seeing its sales stall. Not that many people want goggles mounted to their head. It certainly won't become as ubiquitous as a phone or watch. They would have to do tens of millions of sales annually of a much cheaper model than the current one to move the needle.

And no, PEs have not been too high for the last decade.

[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/pe-ratio](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/pe-ratio)

Apple actually traded at very reasonable PEs relative to the tech index until the last couple years. 5 years ago you could get Apple for 15x earnings in 2019. Now they are 39x earnings. You're paying 2.6x more for every dollar of earnings they produce than you were in 2019. In 2022 their multiple was 22x. You're paying nearly 2x more for every dollar of earnings they produce than just 2 years ago.; You aren’t buying just their services business you’re buying the entire business. That PE ratio combined with their earnings growth is horrendous compared to every other big tech. Their PEG ratio is an absurd 2.5x. And their gross margin is very weak compared to MSFT, META, NVDA, GOOGL.

Earnings and earnings growth metrics are boomer metrics until they aren’t. I heard the same thing in 2021 when all the massively overvalued stocks tanked hard. There’s always a reversion to the mean.; Not sure if I responded to this, but thanks for the context my friend; spying lawsuit = nothingburger.  Company provides hardware to employees, has a right to monitor it. Every company does that.; Apple was apart of the google monopoly lawsuit in 2022 google paid Apple like 22 billion to be the search engine so Apple just lost 30 billion a year cause I doubt the payment stayed that low at 22 billion; It will summarize your emails and that's about it

When they finally have live translations with Airpods (like Google's), or edit people out of photo backgrounds (like Google's), or improve their trash keyboard, then their AI will be genuinely useful; I can't - I admit I drink the Apple koolaid. I'm in too deep now in terms of convenience and usability. They got me; I'm team android & I use a PC. The only apple product i have is an old 256 gig ipod that I use for a portable drive & to listen to my 90s grunge & metal at the gym and on long flights while pretending to sleep so nobody bothers me. 

I'm basically apple free living.; OP didn't get to where he is today from having clairvoyance either.

He took a risk with Apple. Same applies to whether you dare take the risk; [removed]; You're way off on those numbers. The Google-Apple search deal was worth about $18-20B in 2021, not $22B, and the lawsuit isn't even close to settled yet. The DOJ antitrust trial is still ongoing and [Apple's Services revenue actually grew 14% YoY](https://beyondspx.com/article/apple-inc-nasdaq-aapl-embracing-the-future-with-cutting-edge-innovation) even with all this drama.

Even if the Google deal gets axed (big if), Apple's sitting on $153B in cash. They could literally build their own search engine or partner with Bing/DuckDuckGo. Plus their services segment is already pulling in $71B annually - the Google money is just one piece of that pie.

Look at the bigger picture - Apple's crushing it with 46.3% margins and revenue growth across most regions. One lawsuit ain't gonna tank a $3T company, especially when they've got the best lawyers money can buy and Buffett backing them with nearly a billion shares.

The real move is watching how they handle this [employee spying lawsuit](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-faces-lawsuit-allegedly-spying-165143754.html) - that could actually cause some PR damage if it blows up. But the Google thing? That's just noise for now.; banana; I’m full porting to ASTS. See you in 14. !RemindMe 14 years; Bruh their profit margins are already accounted for in their earnings and earnings growth. The growth in services revenue is already accounted for in their earnings and earnings growth. What is so hard to understand about this.

No reason to be overweight Apple here at these absurd valuations. Owning the index you already get 7% exposure to Apple.; even if the google thing goes against them, it will take 5-10yrs to play out with appeals and by then I am sure they will have structured some other way of that pay-to-play so both apple and google still maintain that status quo if they want to.; I will be messaging you in 14 years on [**2038-12-04 13:31:39 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2038-12-04%2013:31:39%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h5rq2e/apples_stock_price_hits_a_new_high_recapturing/m0d5krv/?context=3)

|-|-|-|-|; Bruh good luck staying put in that stock for 14 years.....

Advise you to get off WSB if you want to remain that committed; You're missing the fundamental growth acceleration story here. Current earnings don't fully capture the network effects and scaling potential of Apple's ecosystem. Their services segment isn't just about the current 14% growth - it's about the [expanding margins and recurring revenue streams](https://beyondspx.com/article/apple-inc-nasdaq-aapl-embracing-the-future-with-cutting-edge-innovation) that compound over time as they monetize their massive user base.

The 7% index exposure argument is exactly why you're leaving gains on the table. [Tech is projected for 20% gains through 2025](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/techs-santa-claus-rally-analyst-163637958.html) driven by AI tailwinds, and Apple's cash position lets them make strategic moves that index funds can't capture. They're not just riding the index - they're driving it.

Look at their geographic expansion - revenue records in dozens of countries while China's temporary slowdown masks the bigger picture. The market's pricing in their transformation from hardware company to global tech ecosystem. Being underweight AAPL now is like being underweight MSFT in 2016 because ""cloud growth was priced in.""

Your valuation concerns ignore the quality premium AAPL deserves. High margins, fortress balance sheet, and consistent execution across cycles = higher multiple. The market gets this, which is why they're in the [Magnificent Seven](https://finance.yahoo.com/m/4205eaa9-f620-3a0b-a81a-0e82c7c9fd0b/magnificent-seven-stocks%3A.html) while bears keep calling tops.; Their legal team's already 10 steps ahead on this. Apple and Google both know the mobile search market is too valuable to just walk away from. The multiplier effect Wedbush's talking about with [AI and tech spending](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/techs-santa-claus-rally-analyst-163637958.html) is gonna make that $18-20B look like pocket change in a few years anyway.

Plus their Services revenue is growing like crazy - [14% YoY with record highs](https://beyondspx.com/article/apple-inc-nasdaq-aapl-embracing-the-future-with-cutting-edge-innovation) across multiple countries. They're clearly not just sitting around waiting for the DOJ - they're diversifying revenue streams and pushing into new markets.

The real 4D chess move would be using this as leverage to negotiate an even better deal. Google needs iPhone users way more than Apple needs Google's money at this point. With $153B cash on hand, they could literally fund their own search engine development for decades if they wanted to.; Either tell me what to diamond hands or stop the yapping. It’s either space nuclear or quantum computers. 

(On a second note: look at the exciting shit we can bet on. We a so back); I disagree fam. 

It's quite clear that no price is too high for you since earnings growth and valuation don't factor into your thesis at all. You'd pay 100x earnings for Apple just because they have an ecosystem and 14% services growth. There's no price too high since you have no model to value the company. No reason to continue this discussion.; Nah, if making a search engine and getting people to use it were as simple as dumping the money into it then Apple would have done it a long time ago. They've had the money to do so for well over a decade. The reality is funding it is easy but getting people to use it is an entirely different story. Microsoft dominates PCs but can't get people to use IE/Edge or Bing despite dumping time and money into it. Google Search is incredibly sticky. iPhone users want to use Google and will find a way to do so if Apple removes it as the default on Safari. Google Search is still a top 10 app on iPhone despite already being default on Safari. Apple took the best deal they could get while keeping their users happy.; Eat my dongus you fuckin nerd.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*; [removed]; Bruh, the perfect time for Apple to flex their leverage on search was well over a decade ago. You make it sound way easier than it is. If Apple felt they could challenge Google on Search they would have done it already. Search is and has been worth far more than the payment to be default on Safari. 

Apple is way too late on Search to pull people from Google. The Google deal was great for Apple while it lasted."

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260); You know what's funny? I invested in semis about a decade ago when WSB was on the MU meme.  Too bad I sold and didn't buy back in until way later.

RIP I miss when AMD $9 was the meme here; Now do the next five years; 2 years ago : u/Fatherthinger told me to buy [$NVDA](https://www.reddit.com/user/Fatherthinger/comments/z3ho0r/comment/ixlpm52/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) 

 I bought [$TSM](https://www.reddit.com/user/Fatherthinger/comments/z3ho0r/comment/ixlsbh6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button); And I still lose money on it.; from now on im gonna pay attention to shit i use, apple, netflix, chipotle, monster, amazon, nvidia gaming gpus,  were all things teenage me used, god damn, so obvious in hindsight; Wtf is texas pacific land corp; If you did the same exercise in 2000, you’d find a bunch of companies that no longer exist on that list.; My stepdad convinced me to sell my 500 NVDA shares in 2012 to buy utility and dividend paying stocks. That would've been worth a down payment on a nice house today. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|52627); Wtf is TPL and why is it trading at 200% above target at $1,500/share?; I was building computers 20 years ago - putting in $250 geforce cards in each computer.

If I had only seen the connection...

Why was/am I so regarded? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31225)![img](emote|t5_2th52|31226); \*in the S&P500; Quite interesting to see that some popular stocks including some tech megacaps do not appear in any of those lists even once.; I really like Broadcom actually. Gonna start picking up shares. I’ve always thought Crowdstrike would be the next company to blow up over the next 5-10 years. All this AI and tech is going to need to be protected.; [deleted]; My friends dad used to work at Nvidia and switched jobs in 2009. According to him, he had 450,000 worth of NVDA stock in 2008. He liquidated everything and bought a house full cash late 2008 because he apparently started distrusting banks and the entire financial system. The house is worth 1.9 million.; I am surprised META is not even on the last 5 years list. I guess it will be in another 3 years.; Who cares do the last 5, 10, 15  days: RKLB, ARCH, LUNR, ASTS, HIMS, PL, WOLF, MSTR; Best move I ever made 🍾👍; AXON is right behind in the 5-10-15 years .; im highly regarded because i dont know or never heard of half those stocks; PLTR will be on this list in a few years imo; Nice to see some other familiar names, ftnt FICO ,NOW; red pm means huge green day, right guys?  right GUYS?!?!; Where is MSTR??; Can you benchmark MSTR? It beats NVDA; I put 4k in it a while back, sure wish I wasn’t so poor and dumped a bunch more in it; can we also do a last 6 months performance?; Riding or dying with TSLA calls.  

You won’t shake me out cheap….; Monster stock would like a word; Just sold smci for 51% profit. Maybe I should have kept holding; It is crazy that no matter the time frame, the runner-ups aren't even close.; Advanced Money Destroyer, guys?; and I bought it nearly at the high two weeks ago and watched it rape my portifolio, yay me; Honestly I'm more astonishing by TPL being so high on that list.; MSTR tho; a fucken thousand bagger; That is because last years Ken griffin Q1 increased NVDA position+4000%, then jumped stock on 1 trade +40%.

Q2 jumped stock 47% on 1 trade premarket. 

Q3 +37% GAP UP premarket 

Q4 +47% GAP UP premarket. 

Citadel started selling this year Q1. It's all a scam ran by 1 algorithm that jumps and gaps the publics money until there is nothing left then holds the price after.

I have options; MNST on a 25 year.; …until it isn’t.; From graphics chips to AI, NVIDIA has proven time and again that it’s a top performer, outpacing the market over multiple time frames.; Pretty sure this is incorrect as it only takes into consideration single stock performance, not the combined performance of ownership with spin-offs. Last I checked Phillip Morris, is one of the best investments of all time over any period due to all the spin offs its had since its founding that then went public. 

Cigarette margins to fund capX for Oreo cookies quicker than the standard competition was ingenious.; My first stock i wanted to buy something for artificial reality and I decided between vuzik and Nvidia and picked vuzik. Nvidia was like 40$ pre 10x and 4x split. :(; MNST is better![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640); And my dumbass still managed to lose 80% of my portfolio from not understanding the market; But Saylor told me is was mstr; Oh sp500; Where tf is Microsoft??; Texas pacific land just trucking by ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276); What about intel, planning to put my inheritance in; Best performing stock in the S&P 500* FTFY; Love an echo chamber that prints money; The stars have truly aligned for Jensen Huang.; So what’s the next one?; Dead since I bought it; Very helpful information, now tell me what’s the best preforming stock in next 5, 10 and 15 years.; Why isn’t MSTR on the list? I’m pretty sure it’s outperformed everything in the last few years; MSTR best performing stock over past 5 years; TPL and NVDA has grown to my largest holdings, no intention of selling; It's almost single handedly taken my starter roth ira from $26k worth of contributions to $100k+ in value. Its been TSLA, NVDA, MSFT, AVGO, VGT, COST & PLTR in there just plug plug plugging away over the past 4 years.; Nice that it's up all those years. I'm currently down like $4 per share. It will recover, though.; The next five are gonna be for wolfspeed 🐺; Nice, I own $180K at 235% gain; For now; Lol.it's not even close. It's doubling the next stock in all the TFs. Jensen for president!!; Imagine getting a 927 bagger; And I bought AMD ...; I bought back in 2017, one of my best moves I ever did, pick and shovel play on coin miners that was happening at the time.   Does not make up for throwing away 3 bitcoin worth 15 cents back in the day though lol

Puts??; I bought axon (taser) 25 years ago, before they were big.  Then, the lawsuits happened en-mass.  It collapsed.  I had to sit on it for  years before it got back to at least even.  I then rode it for a while with nominal growth. For a dozen years it did almost nothing.  SO I SOLD IT.  A year later it started to take off.  In 7 years it then went from $25 - $775... 
FML; United Rentals ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes); So I've mostly heard of all these companies, but what is TPL?; It's funny; the amount of rigs I put together throughout my life using Green tech and not once did I ever think they would propel to such heights. I wish they keep growing and that they stay ahead of the competition...but I'd be lying if I didn't say, in the back of my head, I'm expecting the other shoe to drop.; In other words, time to cash out bois, it's been a good run, you've been invested for years to decades, time to reap the rewards.

The better it performs, the closer it gets to underperforming. Time to find the next one that becomes the best performing over the next 5, 10, 15 and 20 years, before it also slows down. Rinse and repeat.; damn. I bought TASR a decade ago and sold it when I doubled my money, lol.

(TASR is now Axon); I bought AMD and TASR (now AXON) in 2013 ☠️

only a tiny amount of each, and I sold each when they doubled. 

would have been a 4472% gain on TASR/AXON, 3800% on AMD; * in the S&P;  And now it’s over 😂; People are sleeping on AMD… no reason why Pepsi can’t prosper next to Coke; Axon ❤️🥲; Where is $MSTR?; Bullish 

Clearly the trend will continue; From IPO price?; Who is buying more at these highs ?; Bitcoin - hold my bear; “In the S&P 500” - now do it for $mstr; Notice a trend ? … 
Classify each stock by industry and you will notice that each industry was poised for massive future growth 10-20 years ago …. that’s exactly why those stocks have grown.; Bitcoin did better; This is wrong. Microstrategy has outperformed Nvidia on almost every timeframe.; The best performing stock price*; NVDA WILL BE 1000 in 10 years BUY NOW; Where is MSTR? 5yr return is like 2,300%; Where is Microstrategy?; MSTR has entered the chat.; The fact that crowdstrike is shooting for new highs this year after a global fuck up just shows you how the big bois have everything rigged in their favor. 

How can anyone start a small company and compete anymore, its impossible.; What about Microstrategy; No. MSTR is. This list only includes stocks on the SP500.; Let your ex wife know she could have been worth 18 million if she waited another 15 years; Putting $70k into nvda back in 2002 itself is a talent.; If it makes you feel better, there's 0 chance you would have kept it until today. At best, maybe you would have held until the increase in 2018 and come out a winner just to be disappointed 6 years later; Sheesh, I was just calculating my 9k in TSLA ipo that I paper handed and sold for a loss - would be 8.5m today 🥴; Reason 9746482017484020374742 to not marry.; divorce can be a bad business move if you think about it. 55% divorce rate & people still get married... what business has a 55% fail rate? oh right, most small businesses & restaurants, nvm carry on; How on earth did you have the foresight at the time to have that much invested in it? That’s incredible. What are your feelers telling you to buy now? 😂😂😂; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787); I got divorced in 2008 too! My settlement was a Toyota Corolla though.; I also had a position of about $10,000 mid 2000's. I feel your pain.; Thanks. This helped me calculate that I should never get married.; Fuuuuuuuuk.

No?; your flair lol; dont worry, you wouldn't have held it this long anyway; Why didn't you keep your half in Nvidia?; Damn; Pushing her thru a wood chipper Fargo-style would've been way more tax efficient 😉👍; So you coulda had 17 million if you just gave her half. This one on you homie.; The flair![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); Holy shit , this is the final nail in thr coffin, I will never marry.; Womp; damn how old are you; Ahh marriage. Glad I never did it.; If my dumb ass just held AMD I could save saved years of pain; i bought in amd at 15 during the 2017 crypto boom and bust. Thought I was lucky when i get out even. If only i just held.; I bought AMD at under $3 back in 2012 :P I sold when it doubled. RIP.; You wouldn’t believe it but it’s all NVDA; Rklb on the list for sure!; !remindme 5 years; TSM has nearly tripled since then.  Personally I would be happy with that.


The grass is always greener on the other side, especially when the other side is NVDA.  Now just imagine being his cousin Lisa at family dinners.; I’m in my 40s and I’m shifting to what my kids and their friend use! The next up and coming consumers.; And reddit?; Yeah.. I use goog products 300 times a day. I want to invest in it. It moves pretty slow though. Maybe some ai will eat it. Whatever happens will probably also be obvious..; What about... RDDT?; I thought the same about GPUs, especially when Nvidia was about to make them for both the Xbox and PS at the time... So I put some money in Nvidia and amd just in case.

When Nvidia went from 100 to 450 I was like ""that's nuts, there's no way it'll keep climbing, and 4x over a few years is amazing"" so I sold most of my holdings. A few months later it was around 1300...; Idk but I’m gonna buy it without doing any research; I live in Texas and don’t own land so I’m buying this instead; I own a few shares. They own land in Texas and then rent it for oil. They go up.; https://preview.redd.it/829b028s4o4e1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db8e229270e1a8ea234cb000b036ad996312df2c

I had to research this company too because it was one of the few old companies on those lists.; Giant TX land owner, AKA oil and gas company, AKA more specifically fracking. Checks out.; LOL!!! I came here to type the same thing!!; Oh, it’s tragedy of the commons that’s what it is.   

Welcome to Texas - where we pillage the land for profit.  “TPL has two business lines: royalties from oil and gas, its main business segment, and selling water.”  

Welcome to California, where we use the brightest minds in science and engineering to actually make shit.  

Southerners aren’t too smart.; A meme stock; Like what?; Dude 500sh in 2012, 4 to 1 split in 2021 and 10 to 1 split in 2024...you would have had 20000sh @ 140= $2.8M. Not only did he screw you out of millions, he is screwing your mom. I would do everything in my power to ruin his life; Oooh dear!! ; You were probably also putting $250 intel processors in each computer, but that has had a very different outcome; You still don't see the connection. NVDA isn't doing well because kids were paying for expensive video game hardware. They're doing well because that hardware they were building to do matrix multiplication in video games turned out to be an exact match to the structure of the most scalable machine learning statistical model mankind has known.; imo its way more painful that the rocket still hadn't taken off in like 2020. I was having long conversations about how the entire future of the world hinged on data and computation in 2018. Shocking how that hindsight hits.; Exactly. The best stocks only after you've excluded stocks with massive gains *before* or *without* entering the S&P.; Like what; I picked up Broadcom after looking at the annual historical returns. Only a single negative year out of 15 years: https://m.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AVGO/broadcom/stock-price-history#google_vignette; They've been disastrous with their $69B VMware acquisition.; check out sentinal one instead.  crowdstrike has bad rep; Soooo 45 trillion market cap?

|-|-|-|-|; Can you sell me some of your copium bro; Is that like a Greatest Hits album of pump n dumps? ; Totally agree.

NVDA is worst of the MAG7 recently,  down ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|downvote)7% in the past 25 days; What makes them so special? I keep seeing their name thrown around. I remember when they weren’t such a hot commodity; it would be second (or first, depending on the day) in the 5 year chart, but it's not part of S&P 500, so not included.; MSTR would be second in the last 5 years with a +2408%.; What?; just give it a decade or two, you'll be alright (probably (actually i have no idea)); I beat you, I shorted it at 260; see above in the comments, texas pacific land corp; Agreed; The same question was raised 5, 10, 25 & 20 years ago; My guy, Microstrategy isn’t in the s&p500.; How else do stocks perform, other than price?; I brought it up to her earlier this year - she took it well

https://preview.redd.it/stwjbi0j6n4e1.png?width=2081&format=png&auto=webp&s=66d2a4dfd372988bb425742124222afc832dfcd2; 15 years of suffering might not be worth it; I’ll tell her for him; Probably significantly more than that with the dividends; And that’s why you get a prenup before every marriage.; I made a little money during the dotcom nonsense and decided to go back to school around when the market fell apart - Wasn't sure what to do with the money I'd saved. I also used to build my own pcs for gaming. My friends and I all loved the NVDA cards over 3dfx, ATI, etc. 

And since I had no clue what to do with the cash (too dumb to diversify) and had lost so much during the internet bubble meltdown, I just figured I would chuck it all into NVDA and ignore it. 

Was just a lucky confluence of factors.; 100% agree. It wasn't in a retirement account, so I'm sure I would have sold most if not all of it by now. Still, fun to dream.; Yeah,  it's like the people lamenting the pizza they bought with Bitcoin years ago.; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260); I posted a response to this question below - just a confluence of lucky factors.; I think you only feel 1/7th of his pain.; I had to come up with enough money to settle the separation.; I've been sticking with the mantra of 'theres going to be more computers in the future than there are now' and that seems to be working just fine. Read a post a good while back, some guy selling all of his amd. I think he went like $2.50 to $40 and he said something like he was only selling because he could and not because he thought amd was done. 

No reason to really believe that in 10 years there will be less cpus and gpus being sold....; You are absolutely right.; How, they are already the largest company by market cap.; MSTR is destroying NVDA over the last 4 years so... not true.; By the way, TSM is currently trading with a PE of around 30. Isn't this really fucking good for a tech company? They are fabricating chips for Apple, nvidia, and AMD. They actually have those companies by the balls. There is no other fab that can meet their speed and power efficiency.; Do you mean TSMC?; My mom told me I have ‘tsm. Not sure how much but I guess I’m pretty rich.; Tiktok, coupons and homeless shelters?; Take out roblox and what would the next thing be for kids? I was also a user of all those products mentioned above.; Exactly the same as me I bought in 2015ish when I bought a 1080ti and thought this is leagues above the rest. Then sold when I doubled my money; Atta boy; This post is my research.; You too!!; To the moon; What happens when all the oil is gone tho; me too.; Sure, because the whole texan economy only consists of TPL and California is run by wework.; pets.com probably; Hello darkness my old friend 🎵; Grandma?; coherent plants squealing childlike long stocking price aback memorize subtract; Google, Meta, TSM, etc, plenty of fans favorites not appearing here.; Bro u lowballin NVDA I think 280 trillion at least; If we get jpow replaced with a paperweight on the print button, we can have that market cap even faster.; This is my own belief but I think they are a 10 year buy and hold. PLTR is probably doing work that is evil but they essentially have software that analyzes organizational data to help them make decisions, think Skynet from Terminator. Their clients are major governments, military, etc. I think they continue to sign huge contracts that are incredibly sticky with the governments of the world for the foreseeable future.; You are def a bear 🐻 🌈; Not yet 😂; Oh, I forgot, we’re chimps looking at price-indicating line charts. Dividends, earnings, nothing else matters. 📈📉🐒; Hahaha Erica sucks! Paper hands! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); Damn her replies are terrible.; Damn I can feel the pain in that hahaha ; Erica high key a bitch. Like her responses have bitch-ass-bitch written all over it.; Is she taking suitors?; Curious why y'all divorced if you're having conversations that have nothing to do with children or any legal needs.; *”I’m leaving you because I need someone who can HODL stocks the way they HODL me.”*; Why do you still talk to her? Lol; She’s looking in the mirror regretting everything now; Fuck that Erica chick; She’s a cutie in the image you have. Is she single? I may or may not have the 18 on paper.; This is so great. 😂; Good you got divorced from that bag of sand.; and now she has the biggest FOMO, she's probably saying to herself she should of divorced you in 2024 instead of 2008, but then again, saved you hefty lawyer fees/settlement so who really won? lol; Who cheated on whom?; r/madlads; Oh Erica.; Ah the classic 🫤; Fuck Erica.; She’s right tho. How do you know you wouldn’t have sold it way earlier?; Iconic way to wish your ex a happy Valentine's Day. She'll never forget how expensive it was to fumble you king.; She was dubbing the hell out you bro. Wouldn’t have told that sl^t nothing; You should tell her EVERYDAY.; lol. You should have told me. You made the right move divorcing her.; “You shouldn’t have told me.” 

I can’t not think about it so neither can you.; I'll suffer for 1.2M/year; Get seperate bedrooms; And then unlucky... ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267); I'm confused, did you ""earn a little"" or ""lost so much"" money during the dotcom? ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|shrug); So no wife changing money but a money changing wife.; Well to be fair I wasn’t thinking too hard back then I was just swing trading.

Now I’m on much more of a buy and hold strategy but that has switched to $ONON

I learned chasing is the dumbest thing to do.; That looks like a pretend company; In hindsight you may be correct but there is a historical precedent where fabs are a bit undervalued for what they do.  Personally, I find it interesting that the chip designers have been the big winners.  I never would have expected that a decade ago.  There is also that looming problem with China which may be a big nothing burger and make that PE incredibly low…or something might happen that in retrospect was quite obvious.; OnlyFans IPO when; Military stocks after Trump admin drafts your kids to go die in the Middle East lmao; They love Cava and Sweetgreen.; Data centers & prisons; It’s game over; Me too. This. I literally came here to post this. Literally. I logged in so I could post, ""I came here to post this!"". This. LOL! I also thought this. LOL! Me too.; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267); Got in at 20 hoping to buy at 20. But definitely gonna sell at 26 this time!; I mean I have 150 shares so fuck me up.; Eat my dongus you fuckin nerd.

This guy was right all along! He probably knew she was cheating before it even happened.; I‘d be bitch-ass-bitching if my ex keeps texting me random stupid shit as well; She’s probably like: wtf am I suppose to do with this information? After being divorced for over 15yrs; Probably just wants this dumbass to leave her alone lol; Ok; We have kids now and are actually pretty friendly. We even took them to see T-Swift in Spain this past summer.; Kids, mang.; She's actually very attractive - I'm a stud, obviously. She is incredibly fit, Google Engineer (The real kind), and works out every day, and she loves to fish... $18 million would definitely give you a good shot.; nah man. Wasn't like that. We were together long time. People change.; The problem is you could be suffering for nothing.; shit me too; trump does that too; Yeah, along come Erica.; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|52627); $100B pretend company that waxed every other company in the S&P since its treasury started in 2020

What does the market know that you don't I wonder?; I would full port in if that happened.; Did you even pay the slightest attention to *any* campaign discussions? Damn hahaha.; What about like a chuck e cheese; Me too!; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); OP texted his ex-wife _on Valentine's Day_ ""We could've been multi-millionaires if you didn't make me sell this,"" he's the real douche; A woman ?  🤣 

Accurate; lol life; Fair; especially 15 years later lmao; damn u guys dont hold back at alllll; Hypothetically speaking, she could realize how the grass is not always greener on the other side like so many women tend to think, and that her materialistic ass could have had everything she thought she was going to get by leaving him. 

A possibility. No idea why they divorced.; Not pictured: Him messaging this fact every second day for years.; Coulda had VIP tickets if you had somehow held onto the NVDA lol; Maybe you should marry her; ""Kids now"" makes it sound like you made them after the divorce.; Thats good because all Taylor Swift's songs are about breaking up.; Are/were either of you in a serious relationship afterward?; I guess while separation people give the reason that ""people change"", but that's exactly the reason they should rethink the separation thought too.

People change; I feel like I am suffering for nothing; Lol.. Life; yes the 'market' always totally rational. is this the same market that boosted DJT? what does microstrategies do? I'm not saying it is fake, im saying it looks fake.; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276); Bro Trump’s stupid ass literally tweeted yesterday that he would basically start a world war if the Israeli hostages aren’t released by Inauguration Day 

Average trump voter political awareness lmao; Sure why not; unused ink nose combative marble attractive makeshift intelligent school busy; we have no idea if they divorced because of him or because of her, or because of a mix. if it was because of her, then fuck her and this is some serious gigachad shit tbh; Or he shared it because Nvidia it was in the news. On that day, nvidia overtook Google in value after having just overtaken amazon.; There's lots of good women out there - one good way to tell is that they usually give you more than one word answers lol

This is a joke btw, maybe she's lovely in person and not a texter lol; You shouldn't have told me; ""She should've stayed with him so she could be materially rich, but the materialistic bitch divorced him"" 

Brother, what the absolute fuck are you doing with your life that you ended up like this?

Walk to the edge of the yard and squint your eyes? Lol; *Start* a world war? Similar to the one we’ve been in for the last 2+ years? The war by proxy?

And Northrop Grumman?; Im in; ok; I am replying to ""She’s probably like: wtf am I suppose to do with this information?""

I am offering hypothetical answers as to how she could find transformative meaning within that information. I have witnessed this phenomena of women leaving men throughout my life. It is part of life because women select partners who are across and above their dominance hierarchy, men select partners that are across and down in the dominance hierarchy. Generally speaking. Not speaking about my own situation because I have been with a milf whom has kids that are older than me for 10 years now.; Fully agree!  She's not a bitch and wonderful your friendly and kind with no pressure.   Enjoy it.   Because I know too many who hate each other and it harms all involved. ; Your ""situation"" needs to be researched to save **man**kind - a man and his wife liquidated their assets after a divorce and can now casually talk about the loss of their potential millionaire status.

Fucking comedy gold.; I wanna know more; Thanks!; So in other words, you don’t know either; lol Trump literally tweeted he will increase the war in the Middle East to unprecedented levels. That’s literally from his own mouth YESTERDAY. You voted for the idiotic manipulated war candidate LOL

Netanyahu owns his brain. Enjoy, regard!; l am constantly surprised how little this is for an agreement we made a long time ago. Seems to beat spending money directly on Russia, but either way I think it'll be what people asked for. You either pay now, or it'll cost you later."
172,Time in the market beats timing the market. Ignore the noise and let it cook. ,No content,https://i.redd.it/sho39lft2k4e1.jpeg,196,2024-12-03 04:49:30,"Let Tim Cook*; Over the time I’ve owned AAPL, I’ve ridden out Trump’s trade war in 2018, the COVID crash of 2020, the inflation correction of 2022, along with a couple disappointing quarters and hundreds of finance ‘articles’ warning about iPhone shipments declining.

It’s easy to get entranced by the market‘s daily ups and downs and constant recession fears. Especially when you’re new to this. When you’re long term investing, you do no need to check the market every 15 minutes. You don’t even need to do it weekly in my opinion. If you can find a stock with a good business model, good growth, and good cash flow, ignore the pundits and stick with it until something fundamentally changes with the company.

  
No one can reliably predict crashes anyway.; 100% correct, I never understand why so many individuals are in the business of buying a good stock and then selling for whatever reason. 

If it's a good company literally just hold, DCA, and buy big dips and it'll keep going up.; Absolutely I just had this argument (ahem conversation) about a stock in a new technology that grew quickly, then dropped. I believe in them for the long haul. So 25% up and a 15% down in a few months. If they continue to be successful and grow as I suspect… it will be just a blip on the way to a strong long term company. If not.. well it won’t be the last time I waste money on an idea.

I've never heard that phrase. Ever.

It's a game - no - it's a life changer; How much AAPL could a Tim Cook cook if a Tim Cook could cook apples?; Fantastic advice; I’m a lifelong iPhone user switching to Android this year. My phone arrived with a non-functional rear camera and I haven’t had a good iPhone since the 14 pro max. I know very few American iPhone users anymore, and most I know are also switching. My keyboard disappears randomly and auto correct isn’t functional.; It’s a mistake I made myself when starting out. In 2013 I sold AMZN and NFLX to lock in a few hundred dollars of profit. I could have been up about 1500% on them, all I had to do was nothing!

I think we’re all emotional about money. I know I have a lot of anxiety about financial security from my upbringing. Long term investing forced me to overcome some of those fears, and those lessons were learned the hard way. ; Well but it depends on the stock really. For etfs, sure. But even a Microsoft or apple might drop one day. So depending on when you enter the market, at some point you might have to sell one or the other stock.; Most people are desperate and want an easy fix for their lives. That’s why crypto exploded and sports betting is now getting huge. It’s a sign of the times and falling faith in the financial system. But the same people cannot plan long term and end up self-sabotaging by taking huge risks.; True! Like Intel, GE, AIG... oh wait!; Definitely got to take the long view.

 Just continue to buy if you believe it's a strong business, it's really that simple.; That would be it… and yep. I’m a believer. 

My Dad is a retired rocket scientist and grandfather (in law) was high up in Lockheed as a chief structural engineer. 

Spent the weekend talking with dad about the technology and the potential for bringing it to market. 

It takes creativity to be a visionary in new technologies. It’s why Einstein said… imagination is more important than knowledge.

|-|-|-|-|; Unless you’re cashing out today, today’s value of your unrealized gains is pretty irrelevant.; I'm curious how the EVTOL industry would do anything except replace helicopters tbh. I see the value with replacing a helicopter with a more capable, maneuverable electric vtol but I see no world where these dramatically increase traffic in the sky?; You are correct. Any single day is irrelevant. That’s kinda my point, did you not read the original comment I made with this post?; I’m not expecting the jetson’s or 5th element kinda sky travel anytime soon. 

I’ve spent too much time in my FIL’s private plane to think the FAA is ready for that anytime soon. The public doesn’t want midair collisions raining down on their houses. Outcry would be insane. 

But I spent time talking with my dad over the weekend. He’s a retired rocket scientist NASA and worked with military air and defense tech his entire career (Silicon Valley) . I showed him 3 companies in eVOLT. So he gave ideas and thoughts about viability of the companies and the industry in general. The military has been looking towards a fast, cheaper and safer small helicopter for awhile. 

He looked at HOVR, ACHR and JOBY.

The areas he was most interested and enthusiastic about for this new niche product…yep… niche. 

They are similar cost to buy, but cheaper to run and maintain.  The learning curve appears to be lower to fly safely and master. Helicopters are tough. Safety overall is sounding better too. The electric aspect makes it easier to recharge out in the middle of nowhere compared to gas. Solar, battery charging basics…off grid can work. 

Private ownership-commute to and from a job for the wealthy. Taxis within big cities to get from say Manhattan to airport. Oil fields and oil platforms transport. (Think Middle East and Texas where roads are long or inaccessible), Medical- basically ambulance for critical, organ transport and where there are care desserts far from hospitals (also think Doctors Without Borders kinda stuff), war time-these are very quiet, times of natural disasters (imagine the recent NC hills and relief efforts), off grid living (think Alaska, Montana, developing countries) 

So while the flying skys filled with these is pretty far off… they have a real opportunity to take some significant market."

AAPL is one of my biggest life misses on building generational wealth.  I owned $10k of AAPL in 2004, half of it on margin, which I realize is ridiculous because it was all I had but I had conviction that this company was the “next big thing” out of college.  

Welp, I ended up selling it off to do life things like buy a car, furniture and get married.  If I simply held, I would have had ~$10 million by the time I was 30 and then some if I continued to hold.  No, it’s not like I think about that as a life decision at all. 😂; Warren Buffet has been generous selling you his shares.; shoot mine only hit $240; Nice!

Manage it wisely and make it to double up.; At what point do you pull the money out and enjoy it? I am nothing but a lurker on these subs but I’ve always wondered when enough is enough for someone. Do you hold onto the stock until retirement? My mindset is that it’s good to have an emergency fund but you should also live a little. Tomorrow isn’t promised so if you plan on saving forever then someone else will eventually spend your lifetime savings for you. I know it’s always good to have more more more but at what point do you spend a little?; I bought 20k in 1998, never sold.  Going to retire Jan 31st, 57 years old.; Nice!

Hope they burn to the ground honestly.; Pretty much my case, I went to a cheap college so my parents gave me 20k they planned for it that I didn't use. I was a film student and film students had apple computers so I told him to put 18k of it in Apple at around $100 a share (equivalent to around $4 today after all the splits), had about 4,200 shares and used half of them to buy a decent house a few years ago and kept the other half for long term. Complete luck, no skill, but still grateful; I met some Apple fanboys in the 1980s who were holding Apple stock.  I wonder if they stuck with it.; Was going to buy apple when I first got into stocks ended up buying a bunch of shares in Palantir and Lumen. My Palantir investment looks to be a huge success and Lumen I got at $1 and it’s now a $7 and was over $10 at one point.; Not rich by any means.

He was already pretty well off.; I was so nervous to buy apple when I first started investing. I had no experience and no knowledge. I just knew making 7.50$ and hour and working all week to buy 5 shares every Friday seemed like a lost cause......I wanted to buy 5k shares of a 1$ company and my dad told me straight......why don't you buy apple? FOREST GUMP bought it and it made him a gagillionaire. So thanks to a retard im doing well.; Yep.; Mind melding; Tim Apple*; Dont most people do that?; If I’m not mistaken, that 150 @ 20 = $3000, is worth ~$1.7M.

I could usually only buy 1 or 2 shares a quarter. The 15% was a nice perk.; Wife(60) and I (64) both retired two years ago. We’ve been saving for retirement for 40 years, and the Apple was just a small part of it. My financial planner wants me to use the Apple stock to sell as needed to counter act the capital gains that will be associated with it.; What's that worth now? Must be millions?; If you’re in your 30s just buy 5 stocks you think will do well over time.  Put 10-20 k on each and don’t touch it.  Save up if you need to but have 100k invested and don’t touch it.  One might hit. 
It’s hard I know, I almost cashed out to put a bigger down payment on a house to avoid PMI in 2001. 
Bottom line just let it ride….; I have 25 shares btw; When a stock price reaches a certain high point, the company elects to split the stock to make the price more affordable.

I just work for them because I'm an europoor; You’d be surprised how many Apple employees actively choose not to invest in the stock purchase program.; Actually the splits and reinvestments have brought it to 13,172 shares, but who's counting. I'm no longer reinvesting since I don't need more Apple. Today it hit 239.50.; Of course there is reason to sell. To collect profit while it's still that high since nobody knows what will happen.; Yup, stupid me. Sitting on 30 shares now and will just keep slowly adding until I retire in 10-15 years; What do indices consist of?; [deleted]; Owning one of the largest international corporations is gambling?; If this is your view on stocks, why not just invest in treasuries instead?; That’s the mental battle I’ve dealt with - the “what if” scenario.  In reality at the time, I would have sold the shares after hitting the $1M mark, especially right out of university because it was a number.  But I play this fantasy game in my head where I say “what if I just let it ride?”

Life lesson, I suppose.  Regardless, I have to go to work tomorrow 🙈; I mention this often, but I am still here.  And still here working at a full time job to fund my retirement plan 🙈; For one I’m 52 and I need to start putting all of these individual stocks into ETFs that are in my IRA. Apple is at an all time high and need to transition from aggressive to more stable holdings. I also have FTEC which has APPL as a holding. This only represents 13% of my IRA.; Oh I see, I will look at it. Thanks!!; Can you pick me up some chicken stock while you’re there?; La tienda de valores; My grandpa sold one of his companies around 30 years ago for around 100 million dollars. He has put almost all of that into safe and secure stocks from what I’ve heard. All he has done so far is buy a house and is still driving the same Lexus from 30 years ago. Hasn’t helped anyone in our family really and hasn’t bought anything for himself or my grandma. They eat out everyday and occasionally go on a small trip. We don’t have a functioning family at all and no one talks to each other. I never understood why he didn’t just live the life he wanted since the family members won’t probably see any of his money. My grandma also is a lunatic and has an aneurysm at anything he tries to do. He did try and buy a fishing boat a long time ago and my grandma freaked out and made him sell it. She said being on the water is too dangerous. From what I gather my grandma is an ocd party pooper so if my grandpa tries to buy something it just gets shut down from her. I guess he’s just stuck with all this wealth and can’t really do anything with it. I’ve never received or asked anything from them.; probably around $6.5 mill; A little under 2000 left worth nearly half a mil; [removed]; Yeah, he’ll go back over ten years because he had the foresight to take a screenshot to share on Reddit today.; And a dash of luck; Bruh I buy a good bit of mine every buy/sell period.; Why though? They understand the interworkings of their company more than the average person…

Why am I even being downvoted? I thought it was common to buy stock in the company you work, its a huge part of the culture in four out of the five jobs ive had… odd.; I worked for a big blue chip company that had a great stock plan.

We’ve all heard of companies that were once on top and thought never able to fall.; Not per se, its just extremely risky to have all your money in one place. Diversity is automatic risk management.; Because index funds produce higher returns than treasuries?; I did the same with bitcoin, sold my share to go towards the deposit for my house. 

I did it because it was the sensible thing to do at the time, just like it was for you.

174,Question about buying options,"Hi it is my first time buying options, I have 640 shares of Apple calls 220$ 20/12 I paid 1.544€/share and the option price is now 1.77€/share I would like to ask how much money would earn if I exercise the option? Why the option price is not higher like, 15€, since Apple is now at 235$?

Thanks for the help!",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h4ovj4/question_about_buying_options/,0,2024-12-02 07:36:37,"Buying options with 0 knowledge of how options work typically is not recommended. The price of an option is theoretically the intrinsic value of its derivative, and while it is correlated, it does not increase by the same absolute amount. The profit of an option can be calculated by a set formula, since this is a call option, the profit would simply be (ST-K)*number of contracts - the cost of the call options.

Please go read a book before dabbling in options, what you are doing is not investing, it is gambling.; Yeah, I think you are in the wrong sub unless you want to talk about passive investing.

Also, what do you mean by 640 shares? An option is a derivative of the underlying asset, a contract for the right to buy (in the case of call options), the underlying asset at a price (the strike) before an expiration date (itm calls may be execised automatically upon expiration). Each contract is 100 shares, so idk where you are getting 640 from. Did you buy 640 contracts?; Is this the 220 Strike for 20 December? I see 18.15 for the bid with my broker. With an exchange rate of 1.0535 at the moment, this works out to 17.22 Euros. With the 100 multiplier, this is 1722 Euros.


I wonder if your (likely European) broker is showing the price with the 100 multiplier, and missing some numbers at the end? 1722 is 1.722 in European notation, not so far away from 1.77(0).; I would recommend firstly, that you stay FAR AWAY from options.. a few years ago I got deep into them thinking I was some sort of day trader option trader cool guy, I lost 20k. It’s gambling, that’s all it is, even if you make money, you’ll just end up eventually loosing it. This sub reddit is for more “adult investing” if you want to do options trading go to r/wallstreetbets. Secondly, I’d recommend using a brokerage that will allow you to actually see and simulate your returns, Robinhood has that feature. But again, stay away please; You sell the option contract - you don't exercise the option contract generally. 

Also - are you sure you actually have listed Apple option contracts? You said - 1.544€/share

Apple llisted contracts are quoted in USD. And they are not shares. 

What are you actually trading? Is sounds like maybe you are trading something else other than US listed Apple options.  

If you want to trade derivatives - you ought to learn a lot more.

176,Technology and its effect on stock market average returns. Does the future hold higher average returns?,"I know, I know.......I know. NO ONE knows what the market will do other than it will go up, down or sideways.

But I feel like we live in a different world now than we did the past numerous decades. Everyone has access to investing. Right in the palm of their hands. Virtually anyone anywhere can invest in any market they wish from their phone. Historical returns are 7 percent (inflation adjusted) based on old technology, processes, access and education on finance. It is no longer the days of old where tie wearing NYSE brokers answer their rotary phones screaming about deals and brokering deals for end user. It was a whole process and really, you NEEDED someone to strike the deals for you and in most cases, suggest what funds to invest in since there was no internet to self educate or even research companies to invest in.

Nowadays with giants like Fidelity, Vanguard and others offering index funds that take all of the thought and most of the choice and a lot of the risk out of the equation. I don't need to ask a broker which SP500 fund to buy. I don't need a broker to strike deals for me. I don't even need to make a call or have a person do ANYTHING for me.

I am not a crypto investor, I am a naysayer in fact. But I cannot deny the effect that crypto has had on investing. It has done a LOT to make investing mainstream, if not even trendy. There were always hedge funds and major investors but now regular consumers are taking part and making retail a MUCH bigger player. Retail tripled almost instantly in 2020 and participation has remained high.

Almost all of the hurdles have been removed between the investor and the investment with technology. There is little to understand/learn and is done anywhere, any time for convenience. Not a fan of robinhood but apps like this have put the keys to investing directly into the end users hands.

Now that investing is automatically diversified, exceptionally well returning index funds are in the palm of everyone's hand, consider that the US stock market is the economic powerhouse of the world. Anyone anywhere for the most part can invest in US stock market. This is appealing to anyone in a lesser financial climate (Japan). Now that the wealth gluttons have their claws in every last corner of US government, I don't see them doing anything but moves to further bolster financial and economic markets. The US stock market is the harvesting field of the elite wealth gluttons.

My personal thoughts though as I said, I am aware NO ONE can predict the stock market. But it feels poised to redefine ""average returns"" and with the near future political climate.....if it doesn't get completely blown up (unlikely) I think future returns will far exceed 7 percent as long as the USA remains the economic powerhouse that it is",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h2ppqn/technology_and_its_effect_on_stock_market_average/,20,2024-11-29 17:35:52,"I’m just going to put right here that it’s going to be unclear if the world has really changed involving stocks until we get past 2030 probably.

The reason why returns are not that high is because there are numerous secular bear markets over the years that have below average returns. The last one was 2000-2009 (or maybe even up to 2013 depending on how you judge). 

It’s just not going to be clear that those have gone by the way of the dodo for another number of years.; Aerotyne; Your argument doesn't match the historical record.

The role of financial institutions in controlling the volume and direction of money flow in the market only began in the late 1950's. ""Retail"", aka individual investors, were the driving force behind the stock market prior to that. Yet valuation multiples along P/E, P/S, P/FCF, etc. as well as market returns were not elevated during this previous period either.; If GDP grows at 3% YoY, can the SP500 maintain 13% YoY?; Retail investors still don’t have that significant of an impact on stocks, most money is moved through billion dollar fund algorithms not me or you trading on robinhood. Also, retail investing is fine now when unemployment is down and the economy is somewhat okay, in a recession I would expect more downward volatility as consumers are more easily manipulated - you could maybe argue that there would be higher highs but then there would also be lower lows.; tech valuations have grown much faster than their earnings growth, so no, it is unlikely to return what it has returned historically.


For example Apple was trading at like 12x earnings a decade ago... tech stocks went from being very cheap to very expensive; This is feelings post devoid of facts or statistics. In other words a shit post.; The present has higher valuations but lower returns (particularly in US markets)

The future will revert to historical returns. It's not ""different this time"". AI may get some ""killer app"", or it may be an unmonetizable producer of low-value slop, with people paying a premium for services that guarantee they're AI-free.; Probably longer than 10 years to establish a new trend; Where do you think the hedge funds that entered the market got their clientele? From the existing (at the time) retail participants. I get what you are saying that but that is kind of my point. I don't feel that the ""historical record"" applies in the advent of new technology which has greatly increased participation and ease. It isn't necessarily WHO is investing, but rather that a lot more dollars are entering the market. Which drives up returns. At no point in history has investing in the stock market been a complete DIY, hassle free experience that requires little to no knowledge and accessible from anyone anywhere in the world. Now ya can

I feel pre 2020 to current is a different investing world. Edit: Downvotes for having a discussion and learning experiences and viewpoints, the reddit way.; Valuations mean nothing when people run imaginary currencies up to 100k a share.; > The future will revert to historical returns

since you're able to tell the future, mind telling me the lottery numbers for next week?; Yeah people are blind to see that investing has changed. It's been on a hyper drive since post covid.; > I don't feel that the ""historical record"" applies in the advent of new technology which has greatly increased participation and ease.

The history of economic development is nothing more than the continual introduction of new technological cycles. This includes services that increase the ease of retail participation. So why should we expect higher-than-average returns indefinitely when your primary justification is something that has been occurring for literally hundreds of years? Innovations and permissive legal changes helped fuel the Mississippi bubble, the Wyoming cattle boom, the Roaring 20's, etc. The latter two had intense speculative inflows from international investors as well.

As I said, the crux of why your thesis is based on assumptions. You're relying on stereotypes of the stock market and vague optimism instead of actual data.  

> It isn't necessarily WHO is investing, but rather that a lot more dollars are entering the market. Which drives up returns.

If the core of your operating thesis was true, we would see a constant acceleration in CAGR over the lifespan of the stock market. Pull up any chart and you'll see this isn't the case. Note that the introduction of seminal new technologies like the personal computer have neither boosted productivity or GDP in the way enthusiasts originally envisioned either.

Over time, stock market returns are mathematically bounded. Ease of participation doesn't exert meaningful long-term upside pressure.

> At no point in history has investing in the stock market been a complete DIY, hassle free experience that requires little to no knowledge and accessible from anyone anywhere in the world.

We can expect worse crashes as well if this holds true.; No doubt, my entire post is speculation and hopium. As charged, I pull no punches about that.

Never, ever has the entire planet had direct access to any investment they want and the ability to research to the worlds end. That is my entire point.

You are clearly more educated in the history of the stock market than I and yes, historical data is all we have to go on sometimes. I will definitely be researching some of the events and timelines you mentioned. Fascinating stuff. I am personally hoping for bigger returns moving forward so my ""not enough"" fun becomes enough to retire.

RemindMe! 20 years; > Never, ever has the entire planet had direct access to any investment they want and the ability to research to the world's end. That is my entire point.

Remember, they said the internet would usher in a transformative era of self-education and knowledge too. The flip side is there's a lot of bad data and incentive to get retail invested regardless of market conditions. 

> I will definitely be researching some of the events and timelines you mentioned. Fascinating stuff. I am personally hoping for bigger returns moving forward so my ""not enough"" fun becomes enough to retire.

Over time the aggregate stock market will go up, and there's always a bull market in some subsector. But understanding which part of the market cycle you're in is essential to preserving hard-won principal."

178,Old IRA very overweight in two equities - opinions please.,"I have an IRA from an old job that has grown to a balance of $700,000.  The “issue” is $425,000 of this balance is made up of AAPL and MSFT.  I bought a decent amount of shares in this account years ago and didn’t touch them.  Got lucky basically.  I’ve been considering selling the majority of the balance in these two stocks to move it to a SP500 fund (VOO).  I feel like I already know what the correct answer is but wanted to see some takes on this topic.  Thanks in advance for any responses.  

My concern is AAPL and MSFT will keep beating SP500 returns but there is a lot of risk in keeping these two positions.  I remember Enron, Worldcom, etc.  

Edit: yes I’m aware there are no tax consequences with this transaction.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h2lr1x/old_ira_very_overweight_in_two_equities_opinions/,4,2024-11-29 14:26:53,"This is an easy question since it’s a tax advantaged account so you can rebalance with no tax implications.  Intellectually pretend you were doing this from scratch. You just inherited $700K. Would you put that much on just 2 stocks?; Just ask yourself what is your goal for the account?  If it is to outperform the market and you are willing to accept more risk to do so, leave as is.  If the goal is to reduce risk through diversifying and keep pace with the market, trade to an index fund.  If the goal becomes even less risk/volatility then find appropriate percentages of bond funds or fixed interest to add to the index fund.  Clearly defined goals for the account help to guide wise trading decisions 👍🏻; Just sell it and rebuy VT or VTI/VXUS or equivalent funds from other brokers.  AAPL and MSFT will be within the Top 5 stocks held in most diversified funds; Yes, obviously sell most of it - but maybe sell all of it and put it in QQQM instead of VOO, if you want to remain tech heavy but have more diversity and still own a big chunk of AAPL & MSFT.; You could start by selling your original position and transferring that amount to VOO. That way, everything left in MSFT & APPL is essentially house money. That relieves the pressure of having to do something.; You can sell without it being a taxable event in a tax advantaged account (traditional or Roth IRA). So if you wanted to sell some of those shares and get some VOO you absolutely can. ; You should also be in r/Bogleheads. lots us are here as well.; It's an ira so cap gains are a non issue. Sell those shares at market and toss it all in voo once the funds settle. If you want some heavier tech exposure you can buy something like qqq or fngs but yeah having more than 5% of your portfolio in a single company is dumb and should be avoided unless it would cause big cap gains.; Funny that no one has asked your age. I'm going to assume you're in your 40's.

Both Apple and Microsoft are excellent tech stocks that will continue to grow long term. I would hold on to them.

You can diversify by putting *additional* funds into VOO etc.; Rebalancing is the low risk choice. Go for it.

You'll still have portfolio exposure 7% AAPL and 6.18% MSFT in an SP500 etf, so if they keep going up you're golden.; Sell the AAPL and MSFT and buy VOO. You’ll still have exposure to AAPL and MSFT upside.; [deleted]; MSFT is still rated a buy - maybe keep some of that?

Maybe sell some call options instead of just selling at today's price?  Keep selling more as they expire. As some get assigned, Once you've sold what you need to you're done with options.; Your weight shouldn’t impact your investment plans.; Sell covered calls until they get called away.; Not sure I'd worry about either company reaching Enron level of incompetence, but both companies are at risk of reaching their growth ceiling in the next decade and it's easy to imagine them stagnating in 20ish years. 

If you're still young then $700k in VOO/VTI should set you up for retirement even if your contributions are minimal over the next couple decades.; Suggest VTI +VXUS but yes; You know the answer. 

Don’t have more than 5% in any one stock.; Overweight is a myth. Your 401k is not an index with limitations on position size relative to portfolio size. In the last five years, Apple is up almost 300% and Microsoft is up almost 200% while the S&P 500 is up only 100%. Being overweight in two excellent stocks has returned more than twice the S&P 500. Why would you sell at this point? Are you thinking that the S&P 500 is going to outperform either Apple or Microsoft?

If you are worried about the volatility of either position, you can put in a stop loss at 5 to 10% below the current price on both stocks. This will limit your loss and risk.

Thank you.; Yeah it’s hard to take emotion out of it but reading some of these responses is helping.  Thanks.; Yeah I’m mid 40s.  My other 401k and Roth IRA are SP500 heavy.  I ended up selling $200k of AAPL today and kept the Microsoft for now.  It was nice of everyone to respond seeing opinions in writing is helpful.; Yeah seeing it in writing makes it clearer and easier to make the move.  These stocks have done so well for me it’s hard to enter the sell order for the majority of my shares but as you state VOO is still a high % of these two firms.  Thanks for the response.; You can also move to a tech-focused ETF. That might be a good compromise. Instead of owning 2 companies, it’ll be closer to 4-5, but that’s still a big step in diversification and there is regular rebalancing.; Yeah I sold a large chunk of the AAPL this morning and will keep the MSFT for a bit longer.  Thanks for the response.; Yeah I’m mid 40s…I have my regular 401k and a Roth IRA as well.; No thanks.; So you were already diversified? I don't see the point of selling AAPL then.; Another advantage you have is that it’s in an IRA.  You could sell all the stock and put it in VOO then decide two weeks later to go back with zero tax consequences.

If you’re having FOMO you need to reconcile that any gains you miss out on is the price you’re willing to pay for the resilience of diversification.; AAPL and MSFT still make up a high % of my total portfolio considering all accounts.  MSFT is lagging the SP500 performance this year and AAPL had a great 6 month run to catch up to the SP500.  Without a crystal ball it’s hard to say if these two companies will continue to beat the US market just wanted to see some opinions here.  It does feel right to me just to further increase my SP500 position by selling a chunk of each.; Keep in mind AAPL and MSFT make up \~13% of the S&P500 when you calculate your portfolio allocations.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Yes, they do a ton of capex, but at least they have demonstrated a very strong ROI and capability to create/enter/destroy incumbents in new industries.

Imo, rather than  whining about Apple/MSFT being expensive and implying this extends to all tech, maybe the most obvious longs are staring right at you with  AMZN (+ Google).; Say what you want but people convincing buying PLTR, SOFI, RKLB, HIMS when they're all up 200-300% on average reminds me of the 2021 period. No doubt they're good companies but surely a correction has to come at some point.; GOOG below 170 klaxon!; Meta just announced a massive infrastructure project to future proof their business.

Investors are gonna punish the shit out of them.; Too late to get in on RKLB? I am holding a fair chunk of cash that I usually just regularly DCA into FWRG, but looking to take a few punts now, only everything is ATH and nothing is looking like a bargain.; Wedbush with a $300 PT on AAPL while Barclay sees it at $184.

You could fit GOOGL in that valuation gap...; How did everyone do today? I didnt finish quite as strong as I started this morning. Bought some Nu dip. Holding a bit more cash then I’d like currently but having a hard time finding places to deploy it.; I never realized this but once your stocks go up the rate of going up also increases! One of my stocks went up by 13% today which is a good move. But because my buy price is so low it was essentially +50% jump for me! Absolutely crazy. Unfortunately when if it falls I'll be in pain but until then I'll enjoy looking at these numbers lol.; 600 looks like the upper bound for SPY today, put interest is evenly distributed from 595-600.; I’m up 400% on my APP position in 3.5 months.

It’s a high quality company but starting to feel a little too good to be true; Any black Friday stocks on sale? Lol; It's been a very good 2 weeks for $TLT.  I know this is a reddit stock group, but with stocks at ATH's; this is a very good time to just buy treasuries and chill.; MBLY went from $11 to $19 and instead of shorts closing when they were in profit, they just opened more shorts and called for lower prices (eg. BOA securities), 23.4% of float shorted: https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/MBLY/short-interest/; UMAC on a tear.; Foot Locker had significant hidden options flow over the last week (more than $300k), and it broke the 50-day EMA on Wednesday. Looks like people are positioning themselves ahead of earnings.

Carvana has the hallmarks of a short squeeze next week.  

Energy Fuels got a nice headwind after Madagascar's government lifted its suspension on the Toliara project. UUUU is seeking to add rare earth minerals to the mining permit.; Wtf happened with HIMS? Last I heard they were down on Amazon entering the space. Now they’re hitting ATHs every day.; someone somewhere said today would be a low volume day but it doesnt seem that way.; $NU and $MELI down sharply at the open, dont see news

Edit: Found it: ""Shares of Brazilian financial companies fell as the government proposed to increase taxes on high-income earners and expand tax exemptions for lower-income earners. The Brazilian real hit an all-time low of 6.02 per dollar.""; New ATH today.; It really feels 2021 again. We keep grinding higher and higher with extreme valuation. Wonders if it will reverse in 2025?; Until the tariff issue is resolved, tankers and shippers will continue to crash. I would stay away for now, but keep an eye on the good companies with depressed multiples.; ""Fundamentals"" Friday lol.

Ill start: AAPL has small revenue growth and profit growth and thus it trades at 38 PE. ""Fundamentals""; Nice -4% day on EVVTY. Great job; 6,100 here we come, baby.; Definitely some monthly rebalancing going on w those closing swings. Dow stocks got bit. Sbux got the rip.; What's the best online forum for stocks /stock pickers? I love reddit but want to keep an open mind to the best discourse available; New ath for the main fruit company. What's more richly valued nvda at 3.5 or aapl at 3.6T; [deleted]; What are you guys thinking about SPY movement for next week?; My portfolio performance:

Bottom 10: https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/s/eDDhggzfdK

Top 8: https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/s/05S0oBhZC9; Yo u/CosmicSpiral , you mentioned POET a few weeks back, I added it to my watchlist, it's up 40% since, had I bought it it would have been my largest gainer this year easy. Nice work mate!; New ATH. Let's get to 6100.

Santa rally; forgot market closes at 1 pm et today.; Took stakes in SYM, CE, MRNA this week. Added to BIDU.; New ath for costco; What do you all think of Ge Vernova as a long term play; Is it even worth buying mag 7 individually if you have an ETF like VOO?; I would love to add my 3 month xmas bonus into QQQ but man does it not feel toppy; I sold half of my position in IONQ, and dumped it into 7dte SPY calls for next week. So that's my full portfolio right now. The bull market has just begun. I expect another 50% jump from IONQ this coming week. I expect SPY to hit $620 next week. I already made enough to retire, but at this rate why not keep making more money. NFA; Really wouldn’t be surprised at all if we get handed a red day in semiconductors after there was a light relief bounce worldwide while the US was closed.; So yet another perfect V from Wednesday. Shocker, another ATH in the SPY. QQQ on it's way. And yet I keep getting criticized for saying that this market will never go down and will continue to make V after V when that is all that it does.; Is buying prison stocks, such as GEO orCXW a good choice?; Any interesting stock tips? I just DCA into the S&P500 but would like to look into individual stocks; I need help with a strategy. As a college student, I haven’t started investing a ton of money. I’ve got about 3k in my account. That said, I’m not too worried about losses right now. I’ve been selling whenever I hit 10%+ on a stock, depending on the momentum. My highest growth right now is IonQ, SoFi, Palantir, and Redwire. Are any of these absolute holds? I’d hate to look back in a couple decades and be disappointed; A lot of equipment names are having a strong day ; What is green; Holiday miracle.; Lol ooof; That's right, from a more informal perspective, from what I have heard from people in this industry AWS is as ingrained in how companies, banks and governments (point being they won't migrate) run that we could mention it could be mentioned in the same breath as MSFT.

I can absolutely see them as being the most valuable company in the world someday.; Both can be true. Most of tech can be expensive while AMZN and GOOG; Welp, I own GOOG, AMZN and MSFT, so I think this bodes well.; Yup we call this rule don't chase; Yeah but can’t one argue if they plan to hold any company for 5-10 years then it doesn’t really matter?

RKLB is my second biggest holding rn and not using it as a short term thing; I agree, but remember that Thiel bought the country's new VP. sooo no stopping that one now.; Surely; They've been punished enough.; Infrastructure project as in blackwell chips?; I bought a very small position at $20 on Nov. 13 so I'm up 36% already  


Not many people would have recommended buying at that time but everything seems to be just going up. 


It is getting kind of ridiculous so play with caution. ; Compounded gains much faster that compound interest; Compounding; It’s your money, so do what you want with it, but I’ve learned to take profit when things go up like that. ; It's overvalued, but not so overvalued that a severe correction is imminent.

If you haven't divested any of your original position, you can shave off 25-35%.; Options collar; I've sold all but 25% of my position now. It's a competitive industry and all the easy multiple expansion gains are pretty much over unless you're betting on it becoming as expensive as say TTD. (on a multiple basis; it has easily cruised past TTD's market cap) I personally have not done enough due diligence to know something about their forward earnings that the market doesn't know (anymore). Up to you about selling off, but imo trimming is absolutely the right move. 400% gains are quite rare and we know the market can swiftly punish that in an instant.; Im only keeping it to see if it becomes a 10bagger for me at this point.  I trimmed enough to make back my original amount.; So good betting on the government adding 1 trillion in debt every few months; I'm staying away from bonds.  I can see Trump's policy destroying the dollar and Bonds even further.  My portfolio which is mostly composed of SPY is barely keeping up with the housing market in California.  Goes to show most of these gains are due to the devaluation of the dollar.; Disagree - inflation going in the wrong direction…and this is before the apartment supply will dry up like a cactus in the desert (maybe a late 2025/2026 story); Don't know much about this company. Why so much short interest?; Brazilian reais just hit an all time low value vs the dollar, if I had to guess why. Most of their revenue comes from brazil.

  
edit: fuck I made this post before the edit showed for me b/c my tab had been opened for a few minutes already; Why would an income tax affect them that much? Especially on high earners.; You would need to got the Oracle of Delphi to get an answer to that question. The real actionable question is if you are positioning yourself to either be mentally ok or portfolio wise stable should a reversal happen?; Yes in some ways it does and in other ways it doesn’t. Someone seems to say this every day lately. It’s kind of hard to have a realistic discussion about the state of the market when people have been saying this in one form or another the last couple of years, right through amazing buying opportunities. People who believe the market on the whole is overvalued often point to one or two metrics and ignore everything else and act as though they know something everyone else doesn’t and don’t want to hear any other opinions, so the discussion gets fatigued.

I don’t think the market has gotten anywhere near as wild as peak 2021 madness yet. Keep looking for value, or stick with your bets and tune out, or if you like you can place a modest bet against the market if you think the opportunity is there. There is money to be made both directions in the market.; It felt like 21 earlier this year. Now it feels like 99; Thanks for bringing that up. I used to own INSW and LPG, but it's been a while. Haven't been keeping up with their movements; What ones would you say are the good companies? Any buy targets for them?; I dont own any aapl... no one is forcing you to either; Nothing stopping it from trading at a 50 pe currently; [deleted]; It is at decade low here on multiples, growth also slowed since then though... I keep buying it keeps dropping, last Q was pretty decent so surprised it closed the gap; These guys have a ton of debt or something?; None.; Twitter if you're selective. I get most of my ideas and datapoints I missed there. Then I come and share them here occasionally (the non-micro caps at least). 

It's also fun to know that I'm DMing with someone who had a $20M+ position in this coal company I have a few thousand in lol.; This is honestly a tough one. NVDA's is in the 'over-earning' stage so it appears cheaper than it actually is. It's going to be a mad rush to the exits when the cycle turns. Apple is expensive but I see it as more reliable source of cash flows in the near future. I'd probably still buy NVDA over Apple today, but exit fairly quickly, preferring AAPL long term. [But I'd rather buy neither of them]; Apple. Nvidia has the growth to back it up. 

I'm not invested in either; Check out their debt situation.; It will go from left to right, that much I can tell you.; Thanks. I missed out on the surge too, but I'm still bullish on the company and will start buying shares next month.; No management fees and it allows you to swing trade a bit more. If one of the mag 7 that you really like gets some negative news (google) and goes down, the etf might not even go down.; I buy some of mag 7 and don't hold etfs; Not all mag7 are equal; Depends how concentrated you want to be in them vs the rest of the S&P 493; 🎰; What’s the position if you don’t mind sharing; Doubt it due to export controls being less than expected, semi equip bouncing in Europe ; Curious to know if you're shorting? I see the same comment abt Semis from you everyday lol.; It will keep happening until it doesn't.; Imo the window to profit in a meaningful way on them has passed and I'm surprised they aren't going back down more. I'm doubtful any of the Trump deportation promises will pan out anyways.; It’s a really vague question so hard to answer. I would start out with very large caps, companies you like, and that have a future in an emerging technology.; I posted my holdings recently. I'm long on everything but Costco, which I may dabble in again at some point. If you have questions on any of my picks I'd gladly answer; You shouldn't be selling so quickly. Sure it's 300 bucks or maybe a bit more, but that is also taxable income now. If the 3k is something you need soon or are afraid to lose, I'd suggest VOO since it's safer than individual stocks. With a solid investment in VOO, you'll have a foundation to rely on investing something in individual stocks. Again it really depends on if losing 3k or most of it is an issue for you. 

In terms of whether these stocks are absolute holds, nobody here knows. People can be right about a stock, but we have no idea what will happen in a year or five or ten. Even great stocks can drop for a bit and then rise to new all time highs.; Better than feared export control news, Tokyo Electron and europe names did well yesterday while we were closed; Would make more sense than NVDA or AAPL.; I think this opinion works more with Tesla and Elon tbh, but if we actually don’t get continuation by the Nasdaq and have semis weigh it down next year, then maybe it’ll block Tesla from doing something stupid like going to $500-510 before Elon and Trump have a falling out. 

Anyway, I’ve made my concerns well known, but I think your most likely case is that tech just continues to be dragged higher to mid February, kicking and screaming while small caps outperform bigly, then mid February is likely just about the top of the year and semis lead to the Nasdaq getting smashed down.

Probably big volatility like 2018 was.; Nope lol they aren't allowed to spend money, only print it.; https://www.benzinga.com/media/24/11/42247515/meta-weighs-sole-ownership-of-a-10-billion-subsea-cable-project; Yeah, I’ve been trimming it but am letting some of the original position ride.

Win-win at this point; Yeah I just trimmed it again. 

Curious, what do you feel is the ballpark “fair value share price” of the stock at this point? ; TTD will never justify its valuations. At 145x P/E, it needs its ROA to increase 6x and EPS 7x. The growth rate in both is far too slow to reach those goals even if you stretch out the waiting period past 10 years. 

It's possible for APP with its current earnings power, but everything depends on establishing the e-commerce foothold and scaling it without margin impact.; You're thinking the inflation trend is up in 2025?; In August shorts had gone from 20m+ down to 11m while the stock was at $14.28.

In November the amount of shorts had doubled while price was in the $10-$15 range, and now the price is at $18-$19, so basically all those new shorts are deep underwater (up to 76% losses).; lol, no problem I do the same thing all the time; Perhaps, but the delta between peak 2021 frenzy and the current market is getting narrower and narrower. At some point, the risk/reward just isn’t there; STNG, TEN, TNK, ASC, DLNG

You'll need to track their price movement and find the best levels of support.; i mean, FUNDAFUCKINGMENTALS should stop it from even trading at a 25 PE, let alone a 38 and jesus fucking christ let alone a 50PE.; well yeah were in a market bubble so of course its gonna keep going up for no reason (until it doesnt); I am down 10% from my OG buy, when I bought I thought it was super cheap and that I would set and forget, might need to research again.; Exactly the opposite; It is insane to think about being able to have a direct line to communicate with people who have that much money to invest.; Which coal company is this if you don’t mind sharing 😮; lol; [deleted]; Any specific reason for waiting? Also did you ever end up buying BMY or did that thesis change?; Please please please do not follow my advice. I have went bankrupt before and may go bankrupt again.

I just started throwing common sense out of the window an started doing the opposite of what I would do (inverse myself). The more ridiculous the prediction I have made, the market has produced an even more ridiculous outcome topping mine, over the past month. Im hoping that by betting SPY will go up to 620 this next week, it may go to 650.; That’s the point.

The relief bounce came in Europe. Small gap up and then move lower most likely for this session in the US.; I mean sure. It will keep going up. Unstoppable market.; Bingo. Retail will be left holding the bag.; Some analysts say that they will be good dividend stocks, but I found their surmise based on a very stretching scenario for them.; I’m kicking myself because I saw rocket lab at $8 but it had already gone up a lot by that point so I didn’t invest. I’m trying to get insight on maybe some more potential winners; Thanks for the reply! I’ll take a closer look, do you think nividia still has potential?; You make good points, I suppose I’ll have to think more about it; Also saw this news 

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/japan-earmarks-extra-9-9-080342643.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHDTc5w47l85eAjWnLHzkJKMJ-tlu9-dzeVcU7XlE1Gnhfwzp9WMl72WcChy58oJ6fqP62snjcYrJW1PdMz5dCGsQ20yssinJpTk-fzBRA4OqdcMGv8_oCKXCTUTB3ds2oVE9ExgtH39aWhZVnAJ284x2InRdHcUq5gceMW_9TeE; 10b over ten years? Nothingburger. They blow 5b plus a quarter on vr goggles.; Right now, the UAFRS data says it's trading around 38x P/E. If we exclude the move into e-commerce and focus solely on revenue and margin growth within the gaming sector, we're significantly above fair value on a DCF basis. Earnings would have to reach $18 per share; right now, they're at $6.00 and projected to reach $8 next year.

Whether APP is *unsustainably* overvalued, akin to a competitor like TTD, hinges on the rollout of Axon 2.0 into said new vertical.; Thank you for the info ; Better only VOO for you. Too emotional for the game.; Seems pretty cheap then. Might have to sell some puts on it.; It was BTU or AMR (or a combination) if I remember right. And I may be off by $10M (it could be higher lol).; There's a big push to refinance it, which is keeping the stock down. It's not a Biden/Trump thing as the rest of the sector has run. It's debt thing. There's a bunch of people who write about it on X and Substack.; I'm rebalancing my portfolio. 

Currently considering BMY alongside other companies like MHVFY. Thesis is still the same.; Oh I wasn’t planning to haha, I was just curious as it sounded like something I’d never do. Have you found success going ape like this lol?; All in with puts on SPY, gotcha..

Jk man, I know how that is. Def gives the feeling that you're being watched and they know exactly what you (as the herd) know and can flip the button to snatch your money with their behind the scenes knowledge. 

It's like all the indicators available to the regular guy say it's a left up ahead but MMs know damn well they're turning the wheel right.; Perhaps, I think we are do for a stronger relief rally though tbh, semi equip side has gotten pounded for like months now; I've been thinking that for like 16 straight months but PEs just continue to expand from nosebleed levels to even more nosebleedy levels.; You actually believe that nonsense? I hear the same BS every day. Exit liquidity. Yet it only goes higher and higher.; Be very careful buying companies that have a lot of online hype. Most of what is pumping hard right now are pre-revenue or very early speculative bets. There are plenty of names that went up big in 2021 on the same principles then crashed hard. If you want to essentially gamble on these stocks I would buy just a small amount to get your foot in the door. If/when the market falls these types of stocks will be dirt cheap and you can make a decision which will be a winner and put more in.; Yup yup, I think AI will continue to improve, their hold as leader I think will maintain, and the pace they lose market share I think will be less than the increase in productivity that their contributions to the AI industry will have. So, as market share goes down, I still see valuation rising. Ai is an unprecedented opportunity at increasing value across many industries that I think won't dip back down in a significant way. The dotcom bubble has led investors this time around to be more cautious, and even with that we see with ai improvements in efficiency in so many fields, that the biggest companies need to embrace it in order to keep up with the growth of their competition. Companies that utilize AI do better than their competitors who don't. Blackwell will rock the boat one way or the other, so we'll see eventually. I'm way late on it anyways but I just really believe in what AI is capable of, as a someone distant relative to the stem field; Not trying to be annoying, but it's funny seeing your username, I had something similar like 20 years ago. We all have to keep aging it seems. Like the other reply said, just throw most of your money in a index fund, keep learning, maybe make some small bets on individual stocks over the years, and quit selling winners at 10%; That's what I'm saying, but they killed it with their earnings, but they adjusted their Capex lower limit up by 1b, and the stocked dropped 4-5%  because of it.; I'll keep crushing VOO with my own strategy thanks.; Gotcha, I remember you used to share a lot of info on HCC. Any updates on that if you are still holding?; Gotcha was just wondering as it seemed you were pretty bullish on both mentioned above. Do you not worry about price jumping until you decide to enter in and changing the thesis or are these stocks you have conviction in for long long term? I always begin with a starter position and slowly build due to spikes at least if I have my decision made!; I just got tired of being wrong all the time. Historically ,every time I entered a short position, the stock went on to have its best performance of all time. And every time I entered a long position or bought calls, the stock went on to have its worst performance ever.

For example I bet on google since the big drop in august by buying calls. My calls were destroyed. Common sense would tell you google is the stock to invest in, not rklb or ionq or sofi or any of that junk.

I also bet that the judge would pass jetblue buying save. Turns out the judge was corrupt and rejected the merger and now SAVE is on life support and will eventually go out of business. Market is definitely rigged.

Last year I bought calls on ionq at $19 they then reversed and had the biggest downtrend ever. Same with sofi last december. Same with rklb last year (the ceo sold shares at the top ($7) which caused the stock to go on an endless downward spiral.

I have SO MANY more examples to give. I feel like I represent the erd and the market can see where the herd is leaning (I can't see it) and they have access to info and all the summaries that we dont have, and they can use it to go against us. Once a ton of retail exited sofi, the stock started flying. Sofi was a joke in this forum and everyone loved to clown on them a few months ago.; Well, it did happen in late 2021.; That's your first mistake. No one uses or cares about P/E unless you take a finance class lol.; You got it. Funny coincidence that is; Stock doing just fine, was 80 bucks 2 years ago. Now almost 600; Yep holding everything. I see no reason to sell any of them. I just have no new information to share about them.

I almost sold BTU when it was nearing $30. AMR is mostly sold down already after a massive bull run in 2023 and just holding onto lingering position.; Depends on the duration of the hold, the ATR, the institutional buy-in and how sensitive the underlying stock is to news catalysts.; Gotcha, you ever consider just playing into the market and buying SPY/VOO just an ETF? Also how did you get enough money to retire then? Just by striking gold on options?; Only for PEs to now be 20% higher than the 2021 peak.; Well yeah no one cares NOW because they don't matter it nonsense bubbles. They will matter soon.

In the long run, stocks follow their earnings. If a stock goes up 100% when their earnings go up 20%, there's gonna be a closing of that gap; Yea, but they were at 362 before that fall in 2022.; Still good, tsla was 420; For sure.

Have held Meta since 2016, and bought more in 2018.

I'm doing pretty good on it, cried myself to sleep in 2022 though LOL."

Even with top relief strap. Just add more monitors to your work space. Unless you have Mac and unless they updated support peripheral since launch, it also had no mouse support. You’ll have to trade with pinching and poking a virtual keyboard.; Sucks ass, heavy, uncomfortable, etc. Returned mine a week later."
182,Apple looking for a run to the upside?,"I love to look at charts and analyse the clear patterns forming (I recently posted about the possible NVDA pullback, falling from the ascending wedge).

Here we have an ascending triangle forming. This is considered bullish, looking to make a move to the upside with my target price being between $260 and $280.

I drew on 2 possible paths I believe the price action could follow.

[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse); “Love to look at charts” ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); stock performance is driven by news and financials, it doesn't care about your chart patterns. it may sometimes match the pattern and sometimes doesn't so what's the point, it's a gamble all the same.; RSI is in the 60’s so according to that metric it still has room to move up; https://preview.redd.it/smi5nopego3e1.jpeg?width=1354&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=44fd517589b27118c04a59fa6ab08c11011224f3

Yes, I understand that news and financials drives prices, but so do MMs following specific trading strategies? I also don’t believe I categorically said it is definitely going this way.

183,Where are future returns even supposed to come from? ,"Happy thanksgiving to all of you, I hope you are able to spend time with your loved ones. Just some discussion points about overall valuations in the equity markets. 

This is something that I have wondered for a while. Almost every asset under the sun has skyrocketed, and obviously people are planning to get a return on their investment, so let's discuss how this is even supposed to happen at this point. 

First, there's the low hanging fruit in terms of arguments supporting that we are in a wildly overvalued equity bubble. Dogecoin is worth more than Nintendo. Palantir trades at nearly 60x revenue and made a nanopenny of earnings on a market cap that is nearing ASML's. Tesla is worth $1.1T and thus somehow larger than berkshire. Carvana. I'm not even going to talk about bitcoin. These are prime examples of rampant market speculation and I believe nobody who has their two brain halves connected would argue that these are not cult assets that are disconnected from reality. 

But digging a bit deeper, the bubble doesn't remotely seem to be isolated to certain sectors. Apple is a lick away from 40x earnings. Walmart trades at nearly 40x earnings. Costco somehow manages to sell at nearly 60x earnings. Eli Lilly commands an 85x multiple as an entry price. ServiceNow trades at nearly 175x GAAP eps. These aren't 2021-style ARKK stocks but the largest companies in the world. 

Nvidia is probably the greatest financial success story of all time but they too quickly need to find another $80 billion of annual earnings somewhere otherwise they will also eventually implode like a neutron star. And all of that is happening while the 10-year yields close to 4.5%!

I mean, I like walmart and I like costco. They are good companies. It's a sticky business and they have carved out a nice piece of the U.S. economy for themselves. But Walmart does nearly $700b in revenue and has 3% operating margins. The current EPS yield is barely 2.5%. What is supposed to happen here? Earnings isnt expected to skyrocket and that multiple is so stretched that even 10% yearly EPS growth may leave bulls without a return until 2034. Never, even in my fever dreams, would I have believed that a company like costco would command a 60x premium. 

It seems to me that nearly any asset imaginable is wildly overbought and that people are just pouring they paychecks into the stock market because it has a history of only going up and to the right. But multiples are arguably way ahead of themselves. Current CAPE-ratio has only been higher during two times in history: 1929 and the dotcom bubble. This is kind of a cliché but at the same time, owning these stocks nets you nearly nothing. So what's the game here? Are people betting that Costco will trade at 80x earnings next year? 

Everything I know as a value investor tells me that this must end and that it is time to hedge. But at the same time, anyone who has shorted this ridiculous market has been ground to a pulp by the onslaught of endless liquidity that's pouring into the market. 

So what do you guys think? Are the U.S. stock markets about to pull a Nikkei and leave us all grinding our teeth until 2040 before a new high will be set? Hope that turkey tastes well by the way.

[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse); Line must go up else 401ks and pensions explode and we have civil unrest.; Those of us old enough to remember 87 and 08 know that the merry go round WILL stop.  I can’t tell you when, but you are 100% correct.  Plan accordingly.; Anyone paying attention knows that we are in a crazy bubble and that a major crash is coming.

But also...

Everyone is greedy and wants to make as much money as possible so the bubble keeps getting inflated.; I think we may have stumbled upon Warren Buffet’s ghost account…; Just look at US debt.

Debt was free forever.  Companies could expand indefinitely because it didn’t cost anything to invest in growth.  Multiples expanded and that became the new norm.

Regular people all over the country upgraded to way bigger houses because they could get cheap mortgages.  They did cash out refinancing.  All that cash goes back into the economy.  Stocks are easier than ever to buy and it’s pretty popular: a lot of than money went to the market and increasing prices.  

Interest rate went up just recently, but the multiples won’t correct because everyone is still moving money around the market chasing the gains that have become normal.  People still believe that owning a share is like owning a piece of a company, but the reality is that they are completely different assets, and stock price fluctuates with stock demand, not with underlying company value.  As long as more people are putting more money into the market, demand will outstrip supply and the multiples will go up.  

One day, something will happen and it will correct, but no one will see it coming and no one will know when.; As long as M2 goes up. Stonks go up. 

Yeah, at some point the music likely stops. Who knows when? 

The money has to go somewhere. Which is why bitcoin is 100k and a family home 700k.; What about UMC? PLAB? BP? DAKT? IGT? and endless more companies that are trading lower than 2x maybe even under 1. There’s value out there for the stocks that are ignored.. a shift is needed or perhaps we just sift through for value.. problem is if you’re not with the crowd you’ll just be stuck with your stagnant “smart” picks.; I see four outcomes for the coming year 

- we pivot away from the traditional blue chips large caps you just mentioned to small caps. We are just a few rate cuts away before the market will consider small caps again imo. Neutral to bullish scenario 

- we keep piling into the large caps you mention and keep inflating assets until it imploded because of some external reason nobody saw coming. This also destroys any opportunity for small caps to rise again. Bearish scenario 

- we just hold the stocks we currently hold and it will just trade sideways for the next year and consolidates as Goldman expects. Meaning no more large gains but still big drops as the most overvalued (palantir, Carvana) finally drop. Neutral scenario. 

- the a.i. Revolution really continues and we will see even more return on capex and higher capex spending than we saw this year. Meaning we think it’s overhyped right now but we have seen nothing yet and Microsoft will hit 800, Meta will hit 1200, Nvidia will hit 1400 again! This is the most bullish scenario.; Maybe inflation impacted P/E forever?; Maybe we aren’t thinking of it right.  Now that everyone has to invest in the market or be left behind, it has moved up what an acceptable level of x earning is.  The baseline has been reset because so many more people participate in the stock market than 30 years ago.; Look at the price of gold and bitcoin. The line go up. VOO is just another symbol with a number that goes up. There is no news. There are no companies. It’s all an illusion. Borrow money to buy more

And please tell the mods to unban me; In the long run we are all dead; Agree on everything you said here. 15 years of stocks only going up; and even when it went down it goes more sharply up, as well as passive investing is likely what caused this. It’s the reason why all returns forecasts are at the lowest levels I have ever seen. Theres nothing you can do about it, there’s a lot of liquidity out there chasing returns, at some point the music will stop, but it’s impossible to predict when.

For any longer term investing strategies, I’d be shifty away from growth and moving it to value right about now, if you can find any.; It’ll all implode, retail investors get royally screwed, then it all starts again.  It’s one big cycle. 

In my memory as an adult, purely off the top of my head:
Crashes:
1987’ish (black Monday?…black something)
2001’ish (dot-bomb)
2008 (mortgage crisis)
2020 (Covid meltdown for about a month)
2025? (we’ll see)

It always happens, just when is the question. Wall Street has a really good idea because it starts with them. The largest are the safest. And I don’t mean the largest funds etc. I mean the group of the wealthiest people who run them.; Well, you see, the thing is, this time it’s different.; [SPY priced in gold](http://pricedingold.com/charts/SP500-1950.png) has been trading sideways for 60 years.

It's currency debasement. Stocks aren't going up, dollars are going down. We're at a point where people continue to buy assets regardless of valuation, because the alternative is guaranteed losses by holding onto debased cash.

Look at the main sources of inflows into the market

* 401k auto-buys

* Pension funds

* Corporate stock buybacks

None of those buyers are price-sensitive.; Investors expect the next admin to massively overprint and make inflation even hotter than it is now.; Our AI tracks our most intelligent users. After parsing your posts, we have concluded that you are within the 5th percentile of all WSB users.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*; 2 big catalysts in my opinion: corporate tax cuts will ignite stock repurchase programs and rate cuts will eventually bring down Treasury yields and all the big institutional money will move back to stocks. Also deregulation and AI adoption in industries will continue to improve efficiencies and increase profit margins. Right now the AI potential is being priced in, but stocks will still pop when the AI potential is realized and earnings estimates are met; This is what happens when the Central Banks of Nations can create money out of thin air without anything backing those dollars.  M2 Money Supply has skyrocketed so rich people (who own the majority of that money) are investing in assets.  Very simple.; Who cares, stonk go up.  Just don’t get trapped at the top, ya mean?; They create more money and it make more money in stonks.; why would they?

People still pay their retirement accounts(401k, roth and all that shit)

We have regard monkey subs like this and big institutions have been burned trying to take money from these regard groups. These big regard groups are also hyper bullish, at all times it seems. 

You have people buying stocks on their own because wtf else are they gonna use their money for, you have Europeans buying US stocks because its better returns

who is going to take money out to make it crash? 

Donald Trump is possible a catalyst for it but honestly he is just as likely to make everything pump covid style; The one thing you aren't thinking about is inflation and cash/ bond markets.  Right now inflation has been ridiculously high leading to massive bear market in bonds /cash.. There is roughly 100 trillion in stock markets but also there is 100 trillion in the bond markets..  If you think governments will not be able to get their budgets under control and continue with deficit then stocks could still be supported in nominal terms as inflation hedge as money flows form bonds to stocks even if they are declining in real terms as currency collapse crisis become more common place forcing governments to balance their budget. The high multiples you see in huge companies with growth behind them is because they are recession proof selling things that people need no matter what making them immune from any downturn making them better hedge against stagflation (Slowdown + inflation). Things that are much more cyclical or would be the first things people would cut from spending trade at much lower multiples with the exception of extreme growth like in tech/AI for example.  You are right though the amount of short/medium term gains in some of these stocks has been excessive and should not be expected to continue but that doesn't necessarily mean  a huge crash will follow therie could be a lengthy period of consolidation sideways trading.. those who buy them don't buy them for excess returns they are looking for measly single dig annual returns that is still seen as a win. In general the market is efficient most of the time so every option appears indifferent, this why you need to focus smaller more niche markets with higher potential growth where the potential for inefficiency and mis pricing is much greater.; Who knows, maybe these price levels are the new normal, and we might as well be buying lows of this new standard.

Unless the economy is hit with a black swan, there's no reason for prices to stop going upwards and to the right.; It's a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy.  Like there's a lot of room for skepticism, but if you were going to pull your money out and invest it elsewhere, where would you put it?  If your answer is ""I have no fucking clue."" then you have your answer as to how things remain as they are.; Grandpa magic wardrobe.; as long as the US can abuse people and keep them poor, investors will make gains :); The stock market, like the economy, is made up and is essentially a Ponzi scheme. If the music stops there’s an issue, but until then stocks only go up.; The US has boomers sitting on [70T of wealth.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Wealth_Transfer) At least a 1/4 of it is not in stocks but land, housing and others. How many Gen Zs will take grandpa's homestead and decide to become a farmer? They will sell that land that money needs to go somewhere. Now multiply that amount with the boomers wealth of other industrialized nations. We heard the term ""all time high"" too often. There are also lots of undervalued stocks out there.; Margin expansion, nothing new. This has accounted for 50% of the gains made in the last 20 years. Also growth is higher today, therefore comparing Cape ratio is not very valid.; Thanks to you I am cashing out and buying a corvette.  You sir are an A$$; Insightful posts, but I wouldn't worry about it. The stock market is a scam and we're all here for the ride.; I believe this is a direct result of TINA, there is a shit ton of money and where is it supposed to go? Bonds would be the natural place for money to end up if yields where reasonable, if long term treasury yields were closer to 6/7% you would see mass exodus from overvalued stocks.

Problem is Janet and Powpow won't ever let that happen, the US would implode with the current debt load. So instead they do ""stealth QE"" to artificially suppress long term bond yield by pretty much only issue short term bonds...; most of the stock market, and all of crypto, as far as i understand it is just a game of greater fool; I smell FOMO. ; 🌈 🐻; Well you told it yourself... Treasury yield is high, the market premium is like 4 or 5 therefore the stocks go up too; What the hell is thanksgiving; The only thing that matters is money supply.; Don’t think. Just buy.; Sir, this is wsb.; I stopped reading when I realized you used current P/E as a barometer for valuations. Rookie mistake. ; I've been using UVXY as an tool if I think spy is going up or down and it's been consistently going under $20 dollars while spy has consistently had not stay above $600 mark. I I wouldn't mind hold UVXY if I think the market is going to crash; How you really finna write us a manuscript without any damn positions; Here’s a sincere question for you - who is to say 40x earnings is over priced? At one time 10x earnings may have been viewed as ‘over priced’; The theater took a decade to get overstuffed. It's getting more crowded, but the exit door remains the same.; Inflation.; Small caps my friend. Small caps; you forget your Fiat currency is worth less every day, which makes assets more expensive.; EVGO; high sustained inflation is being priced in; OP did you trade 2021-2022?; Why are you comparing palantir which is a software company with ASML which is semi company? And ASML is Dutch while PLTR is US based. And ASML is still 2x the market cap of palantir?; TLDR; Forward PE's are trading around 22ish, back in dotcom it peaked at 25ish. So, we've been crazier before, as you pointed out as well. You can blame the FED, the rest of the western world central banks and that insane money printing during covid. Add a 7% budget deficit into the equation. 7!!!! There's just so much money in the system. That's why you have elevated inflation+high stocks+high gold+high btc, you name it. Everyone is high. We live in a gambling economy because of all the stimulus. But what can you do? You either go with the pyramid fingers crossed that tomorrow there'll be another regard willing to buy higher than you did today.

Also, you can't just hedge with long puts. Market can simply be flat too for a year, then you'll just lose the premium.; Still has room to run historically on most metrics. Don't know how much longer. 

$COST and $WMT are some of the more interesting valuations to me.  At least with some of the others you have some pie in the sky aspirations where they'll continue growing at insane rates and nothing will ever go wrong. These bitches aren't even growing that much, and they're commanding NVDA-like multiples.

I suspect the first hint of inflation and Fed either pausing longer than expected or even ticking rates back up will be part of the ""crash"". Crash in quotes cuz it'll be like the dotcom/2022 era, a slow grind to reality.; AI AI Ai; Immigration and 3rd world markets.

I work for an international tech company and almost our entire focus is on South East Asia, South America, and Africa; You're thinning about Walmarts operating % wrong, it's 3% profit every time they turn their inventory, which they do many times in a year .. so that same 100 makes 3 a bunch of times in one year ; They said same 10 years ago.; The market will never go down again, this is the age of enlightened portfolios. Ever since Ai its mathematically impossible for the system to fail. Trust me I know business. Sub to my OF for more info on the next big stock; This thing called earnings. Share prices over the past decade have risen pretty much in line with earnings.; Daily doomer post 🥱 (they are always wrong); Honestly I agree about Costco, I'm the biggest costco fanboy in the world, but I wouldnt touch it unless it drops back to at least 700.

It's a wholesale club and its up 62% in a year. WMT is up 75% in a year. TGT is down 1% lol.; Inflation + corporate tax cuts first, followed by increased interest rates and recession/crash next, followed by zero interest rates and money printing after. Rinse, repeat?; Shit crashes as soon as the Trump tariffs hit.; Who cares just make the money; some things are better left unsaid. Recommend no more posts like these, for the sake of the people, the industries (and our bags); International equities are CHEAP. Great international assets like ASML, LVMH, SONY are all trading at giant discounts. Meanwhile you have your next gen high growth assets like RKLB, AUR, RIVN, VKTX that can give an easy 10x if they are successful in their given markets. No one is telling you that you need to put all your eggs in the large cap US stock basket.; First time?; i think everyone is overlooking the massive and mainly silent crash so many stocks had following the huge swings up in 2021, so many companies lost 5-10+ x their market cap in a few months, things are definitely overpriced compared to months ago but perhaps they were underpriced then. 

combine this with the massive pandemic money supply increase and we are seeing the after effects of a massive rebound, where it will top who knows but its definitely entering or already entered some kind of buble territory.; Dude, if you didn’t do the reading, I’m not gonna give you the answers.; Aaand welcome back to reality where profits are high and money is printed.; I dont know; Just stay invested long term. You’ll be fine over the course of the next 20 years; That is why you ride the wave and set stop losses regularly; Right, but this leaves the door open to a potential recession simply because the equity markets have been so insanely greedy. Imagine if everyone's shartcoins and AI stonks are suddenly cut by 80% and people are not spending anymore like AI is going to give free reacharounds behind every wendy's.; I look forward to the 2027 Boomer riots; Boomers are too busy posting fake memes made by the FSB in Moscow on Facebook.; What if they want civil unrest? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787); This is the most concise explanation.

Western government pension funds (eg Social Security) are basically insolvent, because economic growth since 2000 has been a lot slower than those govts projected, and their tax bases are too small to pay out retirements for every boomer. 

So the feds basically nationalized asset markets and pumped the shit out of them to make them into sovereign wealth pension fund #2. Boomers can contribute on their own with 401ks rather than facing a blanket increase in payroll taxes. The feds top the fund up with QE if the line ever starts going down.

It's a wealth transfer. Retirees and the 1% get a pension paid from a broad inflation tax on everyone else.; I see future gains coming from Warren Buffett's one third of a trillion cash pile, buying distressed assets in the crash he's predicting.

I'm beginning to think that many of you are American, and don't  think to look beyond your own impossibly overleveraged stock market. The Buffett ratio suggests that further growth is impossible. The market cap is more than double US GDP, which is clearly impossible without overseas investors trying to squeeze the last few % out of this once-in-a-lifetime ride. But those investor's will be gone well before Donald Trump is inaugurated.

Corrupt oligarchies with insufficiently regulated markets and the erection of artificial trade barriers make international investors lose confidence in a country. America is about to repeat Britain's Liz Truss mistake, but you have no political mechanism to replace Donald Trump in 7 weeks if he crashes the bond markets through insufficient fiscal prudence.

the good news is that America is not the world. With modern investment apps you can trade any company on any stock market. All you need is a line going up, anywhere, even if your own country is collapsing around you.; If you're old your 401k is mostly in stable assets now and very few stocks; QE has been the game changer. If everybody gets scared and pulls their money out of the pool (eg Rona crash), the Fed will money-print fiat out of nothing and refill the pool.; Unfortunately the market can stay irrational longer than we can stay solvent; Well the merry go round always stops.

""Lower interest expenses and corporate tax rates mechanically explain over 40 percent of the real growth in corporate profits from 1989 to 2019. In addition, the decline in risk-free rates alone accounts for all of the expansion in price-to-earnings multiples.""

In other words, market returns for most people's working lives might be driven by artificial factors more than we might like to admit.

M2 was actively increasing going into, during, and exiting the last three major market crashes (dotcom, GFC, COVID).

As long as there isn’t some insane black swan and/or smoke and mirrors in the financial system most don’t see, it’ll probably be a drawn out “balance sheet” recession as the labor market continues to weaken, and the massive outlays of venture capital in AI continue to show poor returns on investment.; Bad financial year seem to occur roughly in 7 year frequency. 2022-2015-2008-2001-1994-1987...

Fricken meme stock SOFI made 5x to Apple. Only loss addicts cling to old tech at this point.; Small caps have been outperforming for the last 6 months ish; I don't think it was inflation. I think we had ten years of near 0 interest rates, QE and paltry bond yields. During that time there was a cascade effect where money(institutional) left bonds and moved into blue chip stocks and money left blue chip stocks and moved into tech and money left tech and moved into more risky investments. It's like, the safest investments started paying almost nothing and so that money moved into stocks that were becoming less risky and paying bigger returns. This blew up the conventional wisdom on P/E. 

Now that we are in an environment where treasuries are greater than 4%, I think the fact that Costco is still trading at almost 60x earnings is a good indication that investors think that we are eventually moving back to the near zero interest rate, QE environment. It's like they think we are going back to that so they have already priced that into Costco's share price.; P/E shows current demand, not necessary future market valuations; I just made 100% gain on Dogecoin.

Welcome to the stock market, you're gonna hate it here; recession isn't going to come because the equity market is greedy. Recession comes because the fed has been continously tapering the last 2+ years and keep doing so. Recession comes because money supply has been flat for 2+ years. If no new money enter the system then where do higher revenues and profits come from? That's right. UNLESS, the FED u-turns.; Yeah. The economy is fucked because the stock market has absorbed all dollars.

That's why there's got to be infinite money printing, which is then absorbed by the stock market so that inflation stays under control.

Not asset price inflation obvioiusly.; Nothing to add but wanted to say this is some of the most concise stuff i’ve read and have wondered the same. The Wendy’s reacharound line just proved you’re a legend.; There has never been a point in time where the market was considered “fairly valued”. You’re regurgitating shit I’ve seen every year for two decades.; Good points, well-made, sir.

But those investor's will be gone well before Donald Trump is inaugurated.

Why do you believe this? The cap doesn't represent actual value, it's just the total number of stocks x the most recent price. They maintain that valuation so long as people don't sell, and people won't sell so long as the valuation keeps rising.

So long as more money is created to pump into the market, the ponzi keeps going and everyone's happy (except for poor people, of course, but their opinion doesn't count); True. I think I will go fully in, Brazilian soy bean futures it is.
Or you can buy puts or do short selling with US stocks. Or wait for the market to bottom out, maybe after Buffett comes back, because timing the market bests time in the market after each crash and recession.; To be fair, valuations are made up. Money needs to go somewhere and if nothing else is yielding anything, then the premium of high quality names continues to go up. A company is worth what others are willing to pay for them.; They do have the mechanism but have replaced representatives of the people with Cheeto Jesus cultist... errr so they don't. Thank fuck our policycle had Tories in place last 4 years.; buffet isnt in cash so he can buy discounts, by his own word he is in cash due to tax changes implications; Bond markets can still get rekt. Cash is inflated away.; Old people are in full regard mode - retirees are now in NVDA, rather than bonds. Not their fault. The government paid 0% for years. What else were they supposed to do?; This is not sustainable with inflation.; Just lol.. do you understand fractional banking or anything about money supply?  Do yourself a favor and read “The Creature from Jekyll Island” in a hurry.  Chapter 9 is important.  The USD is backed by nothing but “the full and credit of the US Govt”…. 

You tell me how that *might* impact your statement above.; Well fuck it, if it’s irrationally going *up,* who am I to complain?; Warren Buffett is literally planning to just die rather than keep investing.; 💯; Damn that’s a good one. Gonna steal that line from you.; Checks out.  What are you, age 14?

I'd love to see another analysis done between 2009-present that factors in the impact of QE on the money supply. That's a stock market sea change that using a broad 1989-2019 window sort of overlooks.; Like that guy on some committee that told his family to liquidate stocks while telling the public everything is fine just before the early COVID crash. Like all the congress people trading on the effects of their regulations.; 😂😂😂; [deleted]; Really? One you can live in, the other is a spreadsheet entry entirely disconnected from reality.; I've never read this before. What debt tracker are you using as a correlation?

I used to track M2 to the total market until this most recent peak because the money printer hasn't been in used in 2 years. So M2 doesn't seem to matter anymore.

My latest theory to the current market madness is the appreciation of real estate assets. If people pull out equity, that can add exponentially more gas to the stock market fire.; So much this. Layer a graph of US debt over S&P for the past 20 years. Almost identical.

Turns out when the government offloads Megabank and Globo-corporations' liabilities onto their own balance sheet, stonks can go up!; Good enough DD for me.; [deleted]; Not just underpriced but almost completely ignored.; Nothing except “Taiwan risk” comes to mind.. they even have a solid 5% div.

It's that simple, I don't know why people make it so complicated.; Good bot; Good bot; Yeah, they're wrong.  Inflation will be 8% before 0 percent.; ITS ALL PRICED IN; P/E happened and is real.

They generally get an idea of what will happen but things can and will happen as a surprise  lol; What you're looking for is ""forward P/E"": https://finbox.com/NYSE:PLTR/explorer/pe_fwd/

There are names near the low if you look; $UNFI.

UNFI is addressing their logistics costs, as seen in their last ER.

They do $30 billion in revenue.

Some of their clients are Whole Foods and Krogers.; Some legacy tobacco stocks were decent at the beginning of this year, but they have risen quite a bit since then. It's as if people are scooping up whatever they can, which is still somewhat decently priced.; GOLD; [deleted]; Are you sure that's not just economic mismanagement? Deporting cheap labor, slapping random tariffs on allied countries, massive tax cuts for the rich when the deficit is huge are certainly not policies that will help.; anyone who uses ""they"" is a certified regard.; And bitcoin. Unlike 99% of ""cryptocurrencies"", bitcoin has a fixed supply. It's volatile but also an inflation escape.; The ground work is being laid to get J. Pow pushed out and put someone in who's willing to cut rates. Or the tweets and public comments on pushing rates lower will influence the Fed. This admin will measure economic success by the stock market, so they'll pull the levers to keep it pumping and let companies buy back their shares. Shoot, even the current admin redefined a recession as it was happening to say we weren't in one. Coming out and saying 25% tariffs is the start of negotiations, curious to see where those end up landing but I think this is a negotiation tactic to start that strong.; > long term care 

Hm, what does this plug on your bed do, grandpa?; Those nursing homes don't just eat the money. They inevitably spend it. A lot of it will end up in the stock market one way or another.; Pre Ukraine war related ban AK-47s keep going up in value!  👍; Yep, him and that unqualified group of ass clowns are going to crash our economy so bad that it's going to make the great depression look like the good old days.; You think you hate it now, Clark- Wait until you try to retire on it!!!; https://preview.redd.it/uwlf79um1o3e1.jpeg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=55d163e8040a9b5276f437c9b8a0ee9ebf9631a8; FOX News is why.

Yea, that definitely implies they manipulate everything on behalf of the White House, Cambridge Analytica definitely didn’t happen /s; Thank you Edward Snowden. How's it going in Moscow these days?; Edward, I’m writing you from the Midwest USA. Never been to Ukraine or Russia.; Now THAT is worth saving to my phone and spreading around. ; What if ""they"" want ""settle down, retahrd""? ; Then they are not truly wealthy.; Yeah, how many aging boomers will discover their bond funds invested in totally safe MSTR convertible bonds when crypto crashes?; Bond ""markets"" have never been considered a stable asset; Inflation is a feature for clearing debt overhang 


Asset owning Elites love this one trick; it is and has been sustainable. Inflation is a function of supply of goods and services. If there's more money in the system there'll be more bitcoin type of assets in the system where people lock their money into without causing a real world high inflation (because mainstream money is locked somewhere else). More and more digital assets emerge which have no real value in the physical world but are perfectly capable of holding back inflation. Can you imagine today if there was no crypto. Where would all this money go to?? Mucho inflation somewhere else. 21st Century Gambling economy.; Haven't read the book, but I read Zerohedge daily, so I'm pretty up to speed on the fiat-ponzi stuff. 

I get the sense that you're actually agreeing with me here on calling out Fed BS. But I assume you're talking about global de-dollarization?; It’s copy/pasted into literally every thread; It’s a quote from Keynes, big guy ; Ouch, talk about being out of touch with history and reality, complaining about an annual 30% gain.; Sometimes this strat works, but if you tried this earlier this year, 2022 or 2023 you would’ve got your shit rocked. It’s a meme stock/crypto frenzy rn and they usually go together as bellwethers of excess greed in the market. Similarly like in 2022 these times of meme stock pump usually proceed downturns; That's in the paper! I'd encourage everyone to read it.

The paper very clearly argues and shows most of the increase in risk-free rates were driven by responses to the recession in the early 2000s, the Great Financial Crisis, and the Tax Cut and Jobs Act in 2017.

It also technically shows data through the end of 2021.; Yeah?; Maybe spread out your population on some of that land of yours. Vertically I mean.  


 Also, reminder to everyone that 1 USD is about 1.40 CAD; Surprisingly, inflation and GDP did not correlate as well as debt.  M2 is not necessarily debt.  This is over past 100 years from data from some .gov .; I don't think they control everything, but I do think they're big players. Like 25% of Forbes richest Americans list are Jewish. If they think it's going to be a bad year, it probably won't be a good one either. 

And before you start calling me crazy conspiracy theorist, I just googled the thing and The Economist, The Jerusalem Post, Investing(dot)com, and others have covered this. [https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/sukkot-shmita-and-a-stock-market-crash-679621](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/sukkot-shmita-and-a-stock-market-crash-679621); LOL; “G is made up bullshit”? Analysts growth expectations is contingent on the earnings guidance given out by the company, and mega caps usually gives conservative estimates, leading to some marginal beat on a regular basis, but this is priced in. When have u seen big tech miss earnings badly this year or the past year? Its all in line with slight beats majority of time. ; Elmo begging Big Orange to get China tariffs on ev cars is one of those scenarios where past P/E doesn't explain huge gainz on Tesla shorts.; You mean MSFU; That's  a casino stock, not value; Wait that sounds like pretty bad news; Don't want to get into any political debates here, but the cheap labor thing always had me puzzled. 

There are more reasonable ways to import cheap labor. Many of Taiwan's factories are staffed by foreign workers on work visas. Australia and Canada have programs for tree planters and farm hands.

Every other country has a quota for low-skill cheap labor work visas, so that economic growth is not inhibited by labor starvation and citizens' uncompetitiveness is somewhat managed.; You realize Trump renegotiated NAFTA to the USMCA last term correct? He's trying to renegotiate his own deal with immigration as the focus?; My bet right now is that their plan is to just pump money into a stimulus package. My job seems optimistic for 2025 and they ran the numbers for both candidates, but I can't help but feel like they were too optimistic for Trump.; purging the hunter Biden laptop story as well. ah yes they did it once so they def dont do it multiple times. ""I only killed 1 person im not a killer I promise"" mentality.; you seem to have an obsession with the FSB for a midwesterner lol.; Is this a psy op? What if they want me to think that they want me to settle down, so that I don't settle down, which is what they actually want....; Concept of a joke?; They're upper class then.

The wealthy have since before the beginning of this country feared the collective poor.

No one really believes it's the immigrants taking the jobs, the next president is one the hook for delivering his prosperity promises. 

He had to give out checks, money, to keep the poor from taking from the wealthy.

Remember, a few years ago people were taking from the wealthy like it was nothing?

If a civil war happens do you think we're just all going to be standing in the check out line in Walmart?

Every store will be empty. The wealthy never had the numbers.; The boomers probably think MSTR stands for Monster energy drinks.; >If there's more money in the system there'll be more bitcoin type of assets in the system where people lock their money into without causing a real world high inflation (because mainstream money is locked somewhere else).

What do you think happens to the money after you use USD to buy Bitcoin? 

The person on the other end of the transaction gets the USD, and gets to spend it elsewhere, allowing inflation in USD to continue. It's not ""locked"" anywhere.; No, friend.  Inflation has been and will always be related to money supply.; lol. Anytime someone tries to turn a real comment into “but muh Bitcoin!” It’s just another hilarious example of this bubble. Bitcoin is not money and it never will be. I’m the event of a market crash, it’ll be one of the first to go.; People aren’t “locking money in” when they buy bitcoin. Those dollars are going to whoever is on the other side of the trade and just sold them those bitcoins they’ve just bought 

They’re then going to use those dollars to buy shit. It’s just dollars changing hands.; This is regarded; >This time is different!; Is that Kanye's brother?; I think he knows ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275); Clamping down on ILLEGAL immigration won't trigger a correction.  That's what's on the table, NOT ""clamping down on immigration"".

I know they get close most of the time I’m just saying life happens and it’s a prediction in the end of the day; Market is forward looking anyway.  That’s the fun part, nobody really knows what will happen; You mean STFU; Entertainment value; Absolutely. I just don't see Trump being the one to transition to a more sensible system, and he asked Republicans to kill last year's deal on the border where Dems agreed to the kinds of concessions they previously hadn't. Ultimately, you need some sort of bipartisan deal that tries to take the politics out of the issue or you'll end up with the current type of thinking that is alternating between two dysfunctional extremes.; Their optimism is extremely misplaced...; I bet you have fever dreams about that hunk of junk.; Once they have the military, no one keeps promises. As you can see the current world. There are always people willingly fight on the side that is against themselves. There are poors who fought for the rich and powerful. There were Jews who fought for Hitler. There were slaves who fought for their masters.; Even better, you then borrow more money using btc as collateral, so creates more money; And when 21 million bitcoin at 100k a coin suddenly crashes, all the money that wasn't trading hands beforehand vanishes. Unless other currencies and goods that have real world implications, our money is tied up in something that literally doesn't exist.

This is why I want to buy a house asap, because when this market crashes I want to at least know I have a roof over my head. I can work hard for money, that doesn't bother me. But my house is an asset that will exist even when my portfolio doesn't.; ofc it's RELATED. But supply plays a huge role here which many disregard. Higher money supply leads to higher demand and this will lead higher price ONLY IF SUPPLY IS CONSTANT. Throughout history, how often is supply constant tho? Never. Supply is constantly growing, how else can gdp grow? To put it simply, money supply growth is inflationary, supply growth/efficiency/speed/technology advancements is deflationary. Question is about the balance which gives you the price level.; Don’t know why people are buying mining stocks.

While you're right that the other side is getting dollars, you might be very wrong about them immediately spending it. Especially when they are already very wealthy.

Do you know how much money there is on the sidelines??; Your thinking of Kenye; That's a gross overstatement. Start in Ontario, Quebec. Around Winnipeg, South of Edmonton etc. etc.


Without sprawling you can make cities between existing places. One might even make use of the East-West train tracks that exist; hell, upgrade them to make people want to live there.

Chaos is the time to grab wealth and power. Chaos is when wealth and power consolidate. When don’t have food, they will see how much fighting spirit you have.; Yeah, but their long-term revenue stream will be disappearing.  Though...I guess they can mine other coins.  Revenue and profits will shrink either way though.  Looking at ten year potential, I would think investors should consider a large reduction in revenue...unless they are hoping that the other coin's values will approach Bitcoins years from now.  Seems like a very risky bet to me with little chance for large rewards.; I am basing this off of having lived in Montreal and Sherbrooke, having visited Québec city, Toronto and Ottawa by car.


Canada is not unique. All countries have their own geographical struggles. But the main thing is density.


The greater golden horseshoe has half the population density of the Netherlands at a similar size (35 000km2 of land). One seventh of the density of Guangzhou (20 000km2). One fifteenth of the density of Tokyo (13 000km2). Cities fit just fine, and the existing places can (and will) become denser. 


These densities work there because of one thing: efficient use of space in combination with public transport. 


Why anyone would want to live in downtown Toronto is beyond me, though. Cars rule there, that is the issue.


What exactly do you mean with 'comfortably live'? ; I guess the 7 or 8 million of us that live in the “taiga and forest” that contribute mass amounts of GDP are just filler."

185,Microsoft faces wide-ranging U.S. antitrust probe,"The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has opened a broad antitrust investigation into Microsoft, including of its software licensing and cloud computing businesses, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.

The probe was approved by FTC Chair Lina Khan ahead of her likely departure in January. The election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, and the expectation he will appoint a fellow Republican with a softer approach toward business, leaves the outcome of the investigation up in the air.  
  
The FTC is examining allegations the software giant is potentially abusing its market power in productivity software by imposing punitive licensing terms to prevent customers from moving their data from its Azure cloud service to other competitive platforms, sources confirmed earlier this month.  
  
The FTC is also looking at practices related to cybersecurity and artificial intelligence products, the source said on Wednesday.

Microsoft declined to comment on Wednesday.  
  
The FTC fielded complaints about Microsoft last year as it examined the cloud computing market.

NetChoice, a lobbying group that represents online companies including Amazon and Google, which compete with Microsoft in cloud computing, criticized Microsoft’s licensing policies, and its integration of AI tools into its Office and Outlook.

“Given that Microsoft is the world’s largest software company, dominating in productivity and operating systems software, the scale and consequences of its licensing decisions are extraordinary,” the group said.  
The FTC has demanded a broad range of detailed information from Microsoft, Bloomberg reported earlier on Wednesday.  
  
Until now, Microsoft has been somewhat of an exception to U.S. antitrust regulators’ recent campaign against allegedly anticompetitive practices at Big Tech companies.  
  
Facebook owner Meta Platforms, Apple, and Amazon.com Inc. have all been accused by the U.S. of unlawfully maintaining monopolies.  
  
Alphabet’s Google is facing two lawsuits, including one where a judge found it unlawfully thwarted competition among online search engines.  
  
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified at Google’s trial, saying the search giant was using exclusive deals with publishers to lock up content used to train artificial intelligence.  
  
It is unclear whether Trump will ease up on Big Tech, whose first administration launched several Big Tech probes. JD Vance, the incoming vice president, has expressed concern about the power the companies wield over public discourse.  
  
Still, Microsoft has benefited from Trump policies in the past.  
  
In 2019, the Pentagon awarded it a $10 billion cloud computing contract that Amazon had widely been expected to win. Amazon later alleged that Trump exerted improper pressure on military officials to steer the contract away from its Amazon Web Services unit.

Not saying that this will be the case but it’s at least something to go off of instead of just speculation.; Lina Khan's swan song. I bet the new FTC chair kills it before it gets off the ground.; Looks at AMZN…; Kind of ironic Microsoft is finally getting heat after testifying against Google in their antitrust case. Looks like their Azure licensing practices caught up with them. Wonder if this'll impact their AI integration plans...; Microsoft Office perpetual licenses are still available…; I don't think Trump and the Republicans are going to support the fight against monopolies; Good. Little rat Microsoft ceo testifying against google in their trial. Hope sundar takes the stand and turns the tables; I don’t understand how Microsoft has gotten away for so long meanwhile you got Alphabet and Apple basically being fired at by all corners of the government.; Goodbye, Lina Khan. Thank you for doing your job for the brief time you were in office.; A lot of my portfolio is in msft. I don't care. These companies are too powerful and control too much of the market not to stifle competition ; They should have started this years ago. Microsoft is a pure monopolist player that always tries to connect as many other products as possible to their monopoly on their operating system; Wont matter. Slap on the wrist and buy back your shares?; Broadcom should be targeted as well, never going to forgive them for what they did to VMware; Sounds like baloney. Lina Khan is just a useless Chairperson.; A company literally can not become worth 3Tn dollars without being anti competitive. It’s IMPOSSIBLE. The fact trillion dollar companies exist prove the FTC is failing consumers.; Meanwhile Sony has a monopoly with anime in the west and it's about to be even stronger with the purchase of Kadokawa. I love anime and it's sad to see regulators turning a blind eye to the danger there. They also turned a blind eye with Disney. 

I just can't stand the double standards. Go after every monopoly not just the ones you're still salty about losing to. Break off MS but also Sony etc. Every corpo that has even a small  monopoly should be under fire.; [deleted]; They'll come for AMZN an FB next; Send his regards; He probably meant social media, they are convinced they're being persecuted by Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, etc.; [deleted]; These people only care about big tech to the extent that they ban bigots off their social media platforms. Luckily Microsoft is safe in that regard.; Vance can yap all he wants, but all that matters is when the fat lady sings.; JD Vance is a Peter Thiel scion; he isn't going to be a force for Silicon Valley skepticism, unless it directly benefits the Thiel mafia or his boss & actual president, Trump.; I dont think the new administration is going to necessarily be a friend of big tech. Granted they will have a significantly lighter touch.; As they should.  This shit is about Azure being bundled with Office 365.  You cannot take office 365 off Azure and take it to AWS or somewhere else.  Office 365 being a service saves companies hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars a year...; Lets hope..; Microsoft better get to sucking off Trump

Turns out they didn’t do enough for Biden.; It's quite possible they pick someone to replace her, but keep the investigation going. JD Vance is a fan of Lina Khan.; What is the issue with Azure's licensing practices?; i think this was a bait for Microsoft. They targeted Google to get MS produce a bunch of statements and now using those to finally attack MS.; In the late 90s microwave had antitrust issues; How are any of those 3 companies hurting consumers?; I think between MacOS, Windows, and Linux, there’s enough competition.

Browsers: Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera.

Search: Bing, DuckDuckGo, Google, ChatGPT.

Monopoly? Where?; Yeah, these big tech companies should've never been allowed to become as large as they have. Anti-trust as a concept is becoming completely dead in the water.; I have used Windows all my life and have never elected let alone felt trapped by their ecosystem.

The same can’t be said for Apple, but I prefer Apple as a product so it doesn’t matter to me personally; So basically describes NVidia as well.; The DoJ extended its antitrust review of Sony's acquisition of Crunchyroll, but ultimately let it through.

Presumably they decided anime either wasn't a distinct market (i.e. it's just animation made in Japan), or other streamers like Netflix and Disney offer enough competition to Crunchyroll in the anime space.; That's why you hold.

You invested 6 months ago, market crashed for 2, still up 8%.; Zuck bent the knee to suck in Marolago yesterday.

Trumpers will get their grea$e, democrats get there ""we tried to rein in big tech and you killed the move""; Agreed. Lina Khan swung for the fences in ways a ""pro-business"" administration would never.; Have you seen how expensive Microsoft licenses are nowadays?  You can't buy perpetual licenses anymore, only subscription, and they keep hiking the prices. It doesn't even save money anymore, the main problem is the amount of money it would cost to migrate to another platform because Microsoft intentionally makes it difficult to get data out of their platform.

It's kind of like a property owner hiking rent well above market, because they know it will cost their tenants more to move than to just pay the increased rate.

Oracle is the same way. Lots of SaaS companies that seem cheap and great early on, but as they develop a captive customer base, jack up the prices and just exploit their dominant position.; I don't know anything about this stuff. Can you not get office 365 without Azure? Or use AWS and Office 354 separately?; yeah I dont think its as simple as this.; Google said this about Maps and Android. 

DoJ still wants them to sell the profitless Chrome into the void so it’ll die a quick death.; I’m all for controlling monopolies but this khan lady just come across to me like an idiot after criticizing and going after  nvdia — for what? They have been investing into ai before
Anyone was serious about it and kept at supporting their cuda exosysrem even when they were losing money and now that they are reaping the benefit this dumb ass lady comes along and decided they are not playing fair like WTF; Khanservatives; that’s exactly why I wouldn’t invest my money in microwave - $OVEN is much better.; Microsoft**; Office (MS 365) + Azure Services.

Every one of them.; He actually bent both knees and was dressed as a geisha; Lol and you have more self respect?; How does PayPal or Oracle persecute JD Vance and conservatives? If I were him, I’d be going after LaZyboy.; JD Vance is literally a tech billionaire creation, I think they pick and chose like they do with all things.; [deleted]; For anti-trust, definitely; Maybe you don't remember before office 365 and cloud services.  For a company of 20 people we needed minimum 3 servers.  Office, enterprise, and backup.  We would prefer two more to split out email and other network down time coverage.  We had 3-5 full-time people to manage those servers and paid for off site tape backup storage.  Even in the 90's you were looking at 500k to 1m a year just in information management.  That is just for a small to medium sized company.  Of course you were already paying Microsoft for windows, office, email, and backend services.  It was crazy expensive to run all of that.  Now you just sign up for 365 and it is all taken care of for you...; This 100%; You don't buy them together.  O365 runs on azure, but you as a customer do not pay for and consume azure services as a result.  

There is a security and management plane that controls both services but that isn't having to buy azure.; It's available, but not as seamless as running via azure. 

Also running 365 on azure comes as a bundle price. So it's cheaper to run on azure.

https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/08/amazon-workspaces-microsoft-365-apps/; I mean the FCC is tiny compared to other agencies and Lina has not had enough time to properly research and build a case against all of these companies.  I don't know what they are thinking, but even if Harris won they were spread too thin for 5+ huge cases.; She is very young and just doesn't understand what her job actually entails.  From listening to her speak and reading some of the stuff she wrote, she seems very book smart to me.  Unfortunately she has been absurdly ambitious, way too aggressive, and overestimated her ability.  There is absolutely a large amount of monopolistic activity happening in the US right now, but the government has never understood tech and the fact that she though she could take on the mag 7 with out finishing even one case was third grade level stupid.  


Her tenure at the FCC and DOJ will set back antitrust cases worse that the ass whooping the government took in the Internet Explorer case against Microsoft last time.


It is so disappointing how completely incompetent excessive ambition can make someone...; Lol WHOOPS!; Perpetual licenses for Office still exist.

People can use Slack, Asana, Discord, Google Docs instead.

An ecosystem is not a monopoly.; Exactly.; Hiring 3-5 email server admins for a company of 20 people? That sounds horribly inefficient. I worked for a MSP of 4 people that managed all kinds of IT services for  thousands of employees spanning hundreds of companies, and email/exchange servers was just 1 of those services we supported. It's not nearly as much work as you make it sound.

I can tell you we did not bill anywhere near $500-1 Million per year to small-mid sized companies. Try ~$50k a year for a company of 100-200 employees, and that was for full IT support. Or if they just wanted email + VOIP phone line + web hosting, it was like $20 per employee.

You still need admins for O365, btw.; This.

There is a brief period of time where the time it took to setup was weeks. Now it's a press of a key. The time to value is skewed in favor of value... to us who had to spend weeks doing it.

1GB in 1999 took me 7 days to download on dial-up. Today I download 100GB in 25m. 

Is it entitlement? Is it marketing? Is it a monopoly? Or do people just become easily mystified by convenience because they haven't experienced life without?

Microsoft is probably the least stingy out of all of the companies having issues, and I say that knowing the origin story of MSDOS. They could charge thousands just based on the sheer amount they do... and it costs 20 for a business premium license that gives you windows pro and m365.

People are just daft.; you had a. office, with 20 people and 3 servers and you need 3 to 5 people to manage just the MS product suite 

that's assinine, I work in IT, at a company with 3,000 endpoints, 500 servers, and we had 7 network/server people; The reality is that tech is so fluid antitrust cases against them are tough.; The only two successful antitrust cases I know were railroads and telephone.

And it's interesting to think how both industries are dead today.

Is antitrust actually doing good?; That's why I said kind of.

A lot of companies are starting to go heavily into this 'we don't need IT in our company to get things managed, rather get managed solutions to reduce headcount'. Cloud solutions provide this and you need to consider aged populations are prone to wanting already known tools means MS office since the early 90th.; i believe its more of now that microsoft has a monopoly with no competitors and even lower regulations when trump gets in they can just hike their products prices so insanely high yet no one can do anything about it. thats the biggest risk to me; What are you talking about about?  Rail is thriving...  Hell Buffett makes huge piles of money running BNSF.  And Telecom is huge as well.  From Comcast to Satellite to phone to T-Mobile. They make good money and are innovating super fast.  Frankly all of the land based lines are going to quickly be one obsolete with how fast companies can put satellites up these days...  No more need for trans oceanic lines will be huge...; But how does that make them a monopoly? Because old people can’t figure out new products? 

“Kind of” is not legal jargon. It either is or isn’t.; I can't agree. The tools I've seen on the business end are basic at best and there are multiple SaaS options that do it better.

What exactly does Microsoft have a monopoly in? Seriously.

The only sector Microsoft does better than anyone is Azure which is IaaS. Do we believe a smaller company would do it better after one bad push shut down a bunch of companies this year?

They also provide grants and sponserships for businesses who make products that are, at a basic level, the same as their own.

Those aside, Microsoft doesn't raise their prices. Windows XP in 2001 was 199.99. Before consumers used the internet as much as today.

Windows 11 is 139.99 for a consumer home product. 199.99 for Pro. For a unregistered business, you can get a Business Premium License $22 per user, which includes security, windows 11 pro, and a ton of other products.

So again, what is their monopoly in?; Well they don't have a monopoly on cloud because AWS and GCP are there too.; Visit any old big company as an intern or sth. in the world especially outside of the US. You will immediately understand.

Day-to-day business is already demanding to loose comfort and confidence in your doing with those tools for most people.; [deleted]; My comment was not related to the article itself.

It was just related to the comment with the confidence regarding holding the shares during a possible antitrust probe.

Therefore 'kind of' should be fine."

188,I'm interested in trading indices but know absolutely nothing about finance/economics.,"By nothing I mean NOTHING. I don't even know what ""the market"" actually means. I've only studied STEM subjects all throughout school and only recently started my degree. The reason why I'm interested is because a friend of mine used to trade this Dow Jones thing and made some pretty decent money for himself despite losing a lot along the way. 

I know this isn't a get-rich-quick thing and requires time and effort which is why I want to ask, is it possible for me as a ""side gig"" while being a university student with no income, without taking up too much time? (I might work during semester breaks) Plus my time zone is 11 hours ahead of New York so there's that...

Even if I could only earn enough money for an extra meal I'd be quite satisfied. Though I know it will probably be a while before I actually trade with real money. 

Also I'm using a trading simulator game/app I downloaded onto my phone and it's a little helpful but half the time I don't understand what it's talking about. Something like an ELI5 for everything would be really helpful. 

I'm not looking to become a ""day trader"" or ""full-time trader"" btw, nothing career related. I'd rather treat this as a kind of productive pastime, but then again please do correct me if I'm being delusional about anything... Any input is appreciated. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1h16aph/im_interested_in_trading_indices_but_know/,4,2024-11-27 16:02:14,"This looks like a newbie/general question that we've covered in our [resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/wiki/index) - Have a look at the contents listed, it's updated weekly!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Trading) if you have any questions or concerns.*; It's your last sentence, that's key here.

No, you can't. Trading is not a pastime, it's about as involving as an activity can humanly get.

You either commit 100%, or you will end up losing money.

What you're looking for is investing, potentially.; See you cant just earn something. You either win or lose.; Yes, it's possible to do trading on the side, but that's after you become consistently profitable. Before that, you'd need to spend countless hours studying how stocks and the general stock market move; different types of setups; trade/risk management and so on.

You can forget about day trading on the side; it requires too much time and effort. Instead, begin by swing trading, which only takes 1-2 hours per day (most days you don't have to do much). 

I made the switch from daytrading to swing trading last year, and that's when I finally became profitable.

Swing trading is easier, less stressful, less time-consuming, and more scalable.; Sounds like you want to be an investor. There are a series of books titled ""investing for dummies"" etc. They really explain in simply terms and you will have a better ideal which path to take. They have many more titles. But whatever you decide practice risk management from the start. Many books on that subject I already read.; I think learning proper portfolio balancing and allocation is more important than learning finance/economics.; No problem at all. What you need is a bit of assistance from trading experts and then start it off! But, ensure that your knowledge of various trading tools like Coin Market Manager is also present.; I would start by watching tutorial/ others trade so you get a good understanding of how it works; Hard to trade as a pastime in my opinion. I do believe it’s possible to do it part time, but it needs to be treated as a business. Best bet is a prop firm to start.; I see, so technically if I wanted to start trading I'd have to quit studying altogether and spend the whole day doing it? 

Does investing have a better risk-reward ratio?; What's swing trading?; Never stop studying; No, that's not necessarily what I'm saying. It would be possible for you to start trading part time, finish your studies, slowly transition to trading etc.

But you can't do it half-assed. First of all it takes years to become profitable but more importantly, it takes focus. Not sure how better I could put it...it's kind of a binary thing. You either become good at it, in which case YES, you WILL want to do it full time, why wouldn't you? It's probably the most lucrative profession there is. Or, you'll fail to be profitable, and then there's no point in doing it ""recreationally"" or as a pastime as you've put it, because you'll just keep losing money.

I know people who do sports betting as a hobby, and they have like a strict bank of say $100 a month (could be adjusted to one's budget) and even though sometimes they win, they know they're gonna lose it all in the long run, except they're fine with it and treat it as money spent to get some adrenaline or whatever. There are no teams and goals in trading however, so burning away some cash just to say you entered the market, doesn't make any sense.

It's...addictive, and it most likely requires a complete paradigm change in one's life.

So yeah, you could ease into it, but ultimately you either do it full on, or you don't do it at all. That's just how I see it.

It takes most people at least a good 2-3 years to get profitable, maybe even 3-4. Personally, it took me 8 (!!!), although I was sideways (breaking even over an extended period of time) after about 4-5 of those 8. I also lost quite a lot. But I persevered, and now I'm way into profit.

I kept my regular job all up until the end, I always wanted to have a plan B.

So ask yourself, even if you're among the lucky ones and get it right after just a few years, are you ready to make your whole life revolve around trading? And keep in mind, you could also end up being among the unlucky ones. There are people who spend a shitload of time and money, and never get it right and then just give up. Some of them are here on Reddit, preaching that it cannot be done. Trying (for years) and then failing does make people extremely bitter.

\---

Investing is a whole different cup of tea. You can make some returns, especially if you study the stuff you invest in and if you have patience. Unless you put all of your $$$ in some stupid shitcoin, if you do your research and diversify you're almost guaranteed to come out ahead, given enough time. But the returns will be smaller. Less risk, less reward.; Buying a stock and holding it for 1 day to several months.

As opposed to day trading where you're in and out of a stock within one day, and investing where you may hold onto a stock for years.; Lol ofc I won't stop, just saying hypothetically; Got it. Thanks a lot! I'll think it over.; How long would it take before it starts becoming profitable?; No problem. Feel free to watch some basic video tutorials on trading (basic lingo, platforms, etc). Avoid learning strategies, most you'll find are rubbish anyway. And then play around with a demo account. Just understand, that what you're doing is the tip of the tip of the tip of the iceberg. But, no harm in trying :); It really depends on each individual trader's abilities, but for starters, it may take at least one year to find a profitable strategy, if you're good.

It took me 3-4 years to become consistently profitable.; Is it a sufficient source of income for you? Or do you just do it on the side for extra income? Honestly I don't even know if I can persevere learning for more than a month lol I don't really understand what I'm trying to get myself into, sorry.; I have other sources of income to sustain me. I don't draw money from my trading account as I want to leave it in there to compound.

You're asking the wrong questions, and the fact that you're already saying you unwilling to study for more than one month leads me to believe that you won't make it.

If you have the passion for anything, you'll persevere.; About that last part, yeah I agree with you. It's just...my studies are already stressing me out so idk if I can handle something so...grand? I'd prefer to take things at my own pace though, there's really too much stuff that I don't know rn.; If you think your studies are stressful, don't even bother with trading. That'll just multiply your stress levels by 10.; Well when's a good time to start then?"
189,Ai ETF or individual stock?,Any advice on AI ETFs? Similar to when I was considering investing in Apple etc years ago I feel like the next thing is of course AI and don't know if I should invest in single stocks or an ETF. If this is redundant please refer me to a thread if you don't mind. Cheers.,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h0tuh5/ai_etf_or_individual_stock/,13,2024-11-27 03:30:36,"Only invest in individual stocks if you are willing to do the research and follow them including listening to earnings calls, reading financial statements, and monitoring the news that affects the company. Otherwise it's best to stick to ETFs.; Which AI ETF is popular; Would you jump on OpenAI if they went public? Still early days to see who will be a leader.; If the question is there such index’s, yes. But they all have paltry returns. But that might be expected as they focus heavily on robotics. And we are not quite there yet. Not a space I would want to be in.; Really I would heavily advise you AGAINST getting an AI etf. Reason is that there's really only a few players in the industry that are very likely to meet or exceed expectations over time, we see a lot of ""hype"" startups with no moat that can be defended, thus making them a bad ""investment"". A lot like the dotcom era, only this time we're seeing the big players post solid results.

If you want full exposure to AI in general, pick up nvda whenever it is cheap. They have a slice of every exciting AI startup and is the ecosystem orchestrator, no threats on a 5 year horizon that can really challenge them. They are the intelligence-printer itself. If one company is set to become skynet, it is nvda. Note: This is over a long timeframe (years), pick up some of it every now and then whenever it is cheap. I expect to see high CAGR for a forseeable future, it's underpriced because market are unsure if inference compute will be large enough to keep them growing. From my standpoint it's very obvious that it will.

Next wave of AI hype in the market will most likely be based around *companies who employ AI in a great way.* Mainly around existing companies where AI works synergistically with their old business model and also a lot of r&d focused companies that leverage AI in the ""correct"" way.  NVDA should stand still for a while as it moves to becoming more of a blue chip stock and market consolidates. Great time to pick it up.

If you want a bet on a smaller player, there is one that really stands out to me: ZoomInfo ($ZI). I'm planning a DD on them but in short: Their data-moat is amazing, a player such as them WILL HAVE a slice of the ecosystem. They're carving that slice out rn. Their core business is solid. Mngmnt has shifted to the side of being very very cautious lately, scaring investors who just look at analyst projections. CEO stocked up on shares last week, trading at almost all time low. Analysts can't price in the data-moat as mngmnt is overly cautious to avoid hype - they want to show results instead. Probabiity of catalysts coming over the next 3-6 months are high. Next earnings should garner traction. I see it as very very likely that they will strike deals with ERP providers and other types of BI-companies, over time if all goes well, that should push fair value 1.5-15x current market cap.

Googl is also a great pick, apart from nvda they are best in market at using AI as a tailwind to drive real productivity while at the same time having significant compute moats along with a booming hosting service. If amzn is the main hoster of the internet, googl is becoming the brain of the internet.

Source: AI implementation & disruptive digital economies is my field of work & education. Always do your own DD and don't listen to me blindly. A good starting point for zoominfo is their Q3 2024 earnings call; If you buy the S&P (FXAIX or VOO), then you’re getting 30%+ exposure to tech companies.  Most of the top end is very focused on AI. I’m sure you can find an mega cap ETF that weights it to the top few companies and gives you an even bigger AI exposure.  There are also tech sector ETFs and mutual funds to look into.; I don’t feel like there are enough good AI focused companies right now for an AI specific ETF. Many of the general saas companies in the saas etf are also AI plays to some degree; If you’re bound and determined, sprinkle some SOXX or SMH into your account but stick with the heavy hitters… IVV or VOO; BRCHF; BBAI have good growth in 2025; BBAI - 2025✅; 100% agree with this. if you're not down to spend time on research, stick to ETFs, they're way easier to manage tbh.; There's one I'm looking at called WISE that has SoundHound and C3.ai as well as others.; Depends on their key ratios.

But I'm guessing it would be highly overvalued and I wouldn't probably touch their IPO. IPO's overall is pretty bad."
190,$VSH - The Forgotten King of Chips,"TLDR: $VSH (Vishay Intertechnology) is printing money while everyone sleeps on it. $VSH just got the stamp of approval from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, confirming it as a hidden winner in Nvidia’s AI and RTX 50 supply chain. With key wins in MOSFETs, capacitors, and resistors, $VSH is now primed for explosive growth, riding Nvidia’s dominance in AI servers and GPUs. If you’re not jacked up on $VSH, you’re not meant to have money. 

Who is $VSH?

Vishay Intertechnology is a veteran in the electronics industry. They make essential components like resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, and semiconductors. You know, the boring stuff that makes your GPU, PS5, and electric toothbrush actually work. They’ve been doing this since 1962. That’s right, this company has survived every market downturn, bubble, and chip shortage in the last 60+ years. Meanwhile, you can’t even survive a red day on SPY.

Why $VSH is printing money:

Chips are everywhere—cars, phones, smart homes, AI servers. The global semiconductor market is growing at an insane pace (projected $1 trillion market by 2030). Guess what? Vishay is supplying the guts.

Look at their P/E ratio: 12.5 (as of last check). Compare that to Nvidia’s 75+ or AMD’s 30-ish. $VSH is practically trading at the bargain bin, and yet their revenues are consistently strong.

Vishay’s last earnings report crushed expectations, with double-digit growth in several segments. They’re sitting on $3.4B in annual revenue with plans to scale. Oh, and they’re buying back shares like they’re on clearance at Costco.

Everyone’s hyped about Nvidia because of AI. Guess what? Vishay supplies components used in AI hardware, EV charging stations, and industrial automation. While Nvidia makes the sexy GPUs, Vishay sells the boring but essential resistors and capacitors that keep those GPUs from melting your motherboard. They’re eating up the market share. 

Recent Catalysts: 

Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo dropped a bombshell: Vishay is a key supplier for Nvidia’s Blackwell AI servers (GB200 series, DGX/HGX B200) and the upcoming RTX 50 series graphics cards. These are Nvidia’s future bread-and-butter products, dominating AI and high-end gaming.

Vishay replaced Infineon as Nvidia’s MOSFET supplier. Yes, Infineon, the semiconductor giant, just got sidelined. This Is MASSIVE for $VSH. 

Vishay is providing MOSFET/DrMOS (VRPower), vPolyTan (Polymer Tantalum Capacitors), and Current Shunt Resistors. These components are critical for Nvidia’s most cutting-edge products:
	•	GB200 series AI servers: Nvidia’s next-gen AI infrastructure.
	•	RTX 50 series GPUs: The next flagship graphics cards.
Vishay’s vPolyTan capacitors (especially the T55 series) are already facing a supply crunch for 2025. That’s how in-demand they are.

Kuo estimates that Vishay’s MOSFET production alone will contribute 20%-30% of revenue by 2025—with above-average gross profit margins. The vPolyTan capacitors will add a high single-digit percentage of revenue with significantly above-average margins. Translation? Vishay is printing money.

Vishay’s production lines are already at capacity through 2025. When your biggest challenge is meeting demand, you’re in a good spot.

Beyond Nvidia, Vishay is also poised to benefit from:
	•	Automotive rebound: As EV production scales, Vishay’s components are critical.
	•	IoT growth: Billions of devices mean billions of tiny components. Vishay is at the center of it.

The Stock Is Still Cheap

Even after today’s 7% jump to $18.35, $VSH is wildly undervalued. As I said earlier, the P/E ratio is still around 12-13, compared to Nvidia’s 75+. This is a company with real earnings, real dividends, and real growth potential. This is a great opportunity to make back everything you lost from your MSTR calls.

NVDA is a one of one supplier right now. VSH makes commodity parts. Yeah you need them, but they are a one of many supplier. They cant name their price like NVDA. That might explain why their revenue growth over 10 years is a  whopping 20% total.

---

**Ticker:** MSTR, NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN

**Direction:** MSTR and NVDA down until after Christmas; MSFT, AAPL, and AMZN stable or up.

**Prognosis:**  Hold stable stocks; avoid MSTR and NVDA until after the holiday shopping season.  Profit-taking for holiday spending is impacting growth stocks.

**Holiday Shopping Impact:**  People are selling stocks to fund holiday shopping, impacting some tech stocks negatively.

**Bonus:** This is apparently the ""new holiday trend.""; Consider people selling to buy gifts as a gift to you to buy their shares for cheaper. For the most part though I think the real money that moves stocks doesn't sell to buy gifts; Lmao bro thinks retail traders selling their assets is gonna cause a downtrend. You fool that’s what the MM’s do.; S and P is up so there is not an increased need to sell. Rather, these stocks particularly MSTR is responding to being overvalued; Sold 25 shares of NVDA for Red Cat haha. That’s my gift; Profit?; People really take profit to buy gifts? No wonder people are poor. I'd expect a santa clause rally with profit and loss taking before the new year. Looking to sell some positions before christmas eve.; Or people realize that Microstrategy is a ponzi scheme and are selling for a profit while retail becomes bag holders.

194,Stock Market: An Overspeculation Environment,"There are eery comparisions to the dot-com bubble, it is becoming increasingly hard to believe that a rising industry such as the AI one is worth what investors are betting its worth.

Top 5 Positions in the S&P500 index as of as of 11/22/2024.

|Rank|Company|Weight|Price|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|Apple Inc.|6.91%|232.15|
|2|Nvidia Corp|6.91%|136.35|
|3|Microsoft Corp|6.13%|418.59|
|4|Amazon.com Inc|3.64%|201.47|
|5|Meta Platforms, Inc. Class A|2.42%|564.78|

Now lets look at the P/E of these companies:

* Apple: 38.28x
* Nvidia: 53.76x
* Microsoft: 34.64x
* Amazon: 43.14x
* Meta: 26.67x

>*""The 10 largest US stocks now account for 33% of the S&P 500 index’s market value, well above the 27% share reached at the peak of the tech bubble in 2000""* \- *Ben Snider, Goldman Sachs*

The revenues that these companies are generating are not at all adjusted to the prices at which their stocks are trading at, we are in a overconcentrated and overvalued market environment.

This is exactly what happened in 2001 with the dot-com bubble, companies were trading at absurd levels driven by the speculation that the internet would revolutionize the world and so anyone with a few spare bills dumped them into the market, deeming anything "".com"" was good enough.

The same is happening today with AI, we started with NVIDIA and we are still in the honeymoon phase with it, however we are starting to see many other AI related startups and companies, there is a big speculation about this industry and the idea that it will revolutionize the world, altough it most likely will we must have into account that this is the economy we are talking about, and we are talking about fair value.

I would like to read your opinions on this if you are concerned at all and if you believe 2025 will bring a correction to the markets or we continue to fuel up this, so called, ""bubble"" (dont call me bubble boy).

[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse); All you say is true. Including your concerns (which are shared). But, nobody here (or elsewhere) has any idea when correction will settle in and to where money will move. The trivial part is to know what is good/bad etc, the timing of when the market regains some logic is what the gamble is about. I am clueless and so are you.; Will do. Bubble Boy ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267); As long as people are employed and have the spare income to gamble with they will continue to do so.  When unemployment goes up and people start selling to pay the bills the tide will shift.  Same with the housing market.; When was the casino, err... um...stock market not about over speculation?; im pretty sure Amzn at 43 p/e is the lowest multiple ive seen on the stock since i started in 2016. Also, these are not just AI plays, they are cloud plays as well. the valuations are too low imho; I'm sorry the answer we were looking for was moops.; To me the over speculation is more readily observable in the recent rally of companies like teladoc, peloton, lemonade, etc. These stocks all rally during the obvious over speculation phase of the pandemic and I believe you're seeing that repeat as of right now to a lesser degree. I'm looking to take some short positions and puts on some of these assets in the next week. Timing these kinds of rallies is difficult but I will enter my position slowly and increase if things go sideways for me from the start.; Yeah all those companies ONLY do AI stuff...; Don't let (pre)historic measurements of P/E freeze your mind into paralysis.  Judge these  companies by their products or services and what they mean to the world.  The 5 companies you named  deserve their place on that list and they are somewhat inelastic.  You famously heard Buffett say an iPhone is more valuable than a car.   The good companies rarely let you in.  

I have more issues with companies like Tesla, nuclear, crypto, and other fads.  You're picking the fight with the wrong team imo.

Also, if you want to point the finger, you can do so at the govt and human's worst habits like the push toward zero rates, required 401k enrollment into target date funds, the mass adoption of passive investing, the inception of leveraged etfs, and the casino effect for options junkies.  Nvda is pumped full of steroids on options. 

Just my 2 cents.  Mag5 for life, hodl for real dawg.  They don't miss.; Nothing is a bubble anymore brother. Its called hyper inflation. The purchase power of the USD falls, the price of things just go up. I do believe there will never be a crash of any sorts anymore in any market. Real estate, stocks, everything will just keep getting more expensive, due to the nature of the powers that be debasing the dollar and sucking away its purchase power.; There haven't been comparisons to the dot com bubble by anyone with a clue since the spring when people started making that claim. This is nothing like he [dot.com](http://dot.com) bubble, why do people recycle this garbage?

Things are frothy, what's interesting is the amount of shorting is increasing almost at the same rate as the valuations, which isn't what happened then.

You also don't have people pouring billions into a company that just has a domain name. And institutional buying isn't even at an all time high.

You can't call a bubble based on a P/E metric. AMZN and MSFT are actually undervalued.

Of course there is hype and there will be correction. That's not a bubble.; Get me some junk bonds to hedge.; I’m the biggest rainbow bear there is but I’m riding this doomed freight train until it launches itself into the gorge. If you could tell me the exact day to load up on SQQQ I would appreciate it.; This is going to sound dumb. So be ready to lose some braincells. What if, prices of these assets are just being driven up as a result of how the internet revolutionized the world and these industries being pumped up. And it's just a delayed effect that was supposed to really happen when the dot com bubble popped. And now we aren't in a bubble, we are just creating the foundation for a new bubble.; Crypto is going crazy too; Eerie I think; Imagine comparing Microsoft and Apple to pets.com ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640); The comparison to the dot com bubble is flawed. Nvidia has physical products and is selling billions worth of it. Google is making money as is Microsoft. Dot com companies largely had nothing but buzzwords.; “hard to believe that a rising industry such as the AI one is worth what investors are betting its worth.”

No offense, but markets don’t care what you, or all the Joes and Janes believe it is worth. 

It only boils down to supply and demand, which set the equilibrium market price. And buyers and sellers agree on that price.; I, for one, think that the stock market reached what looks like a permanently high plateau. Everybody who doesn't buy now will be priced out forever. Anybody who does buy will be rewarded with a lifetime of riches.; It’s a money grab time! Everything is on sale, grab while it lasts; Legitimately dotcom was in fact worth what speculators thought (if not more), just not at the speed they thought it would happen at.; Yeah these companies are very profitable tho. Dot com bubble was companies earning negative amounts. There’s a difference. This is not a bubble,  it’s just a float above the 20 day MVA. When sell off down to the 50 again people will be like “oh this is a fair evaluation, NVDA is at 25x forward earnings”; Name one company on SP500 that won’t exist if AI goes away; The market can continue to be wrong long after you’ve run out of money.; If I had to assign a trading strategy given the current environment it basically comes down to avoiding indexes, some minor percentage of bonds, precious metals, defensive ended stocks (preferably with a dividend derived from reliable cash flows).

I would increase the margin of safety on stocks you want to buy. given the concerns of the market as a whole. Be mindful of debt and whether or not they can service the interest expenses.  Maybe lighten up the equity load for more liquidity as I see people are doing in the comments.

It's definitely a time to be cautious.; Everyone knows this, it’s just no one knows when it will pop; And the truth is this government is gonna juice the fuck out the market for a while longer yet! It’s coming and it will be shit when it comes, just make you filled your belly before it hits because that’s what everyone else is doing!; Until then we party ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); Is there anything you are doing different with your positions/portfolio to adjust for these conditions?; The correction will start on March 5th 2025, it'll be a week of single digit red followed by a major exodus of capital leading to double digit downs the week after. SP500 will be set back about 2 years and NVIDIA will go back to P/E of about 15.

BTC will also take a haircut to the extent that it becomes clearer for everyone it is NOT an independent holding but instead correlated closely to Gold. This will trigger a rotation BTC to GOLD and BONDS in April and May, leading to a new plateau for BTC around 25K.; Dotcom, 08, jan 2020… all ATH’s, at their respective times.

People were calling speculative, irrational highs during the dotcom bubble for years, same with 08, and with 2020.

The rug only gets pulled after wall st delays cause-effect and necessity, and, importantly, after they lul the populace into fomoing.

However…

The only real, consequential way “this time is different” is that we are on the very real precipice of forever losing the ability to pay our sovereign debt. As such, purposeful inflation, to inflate away some of the debt, is not unlikely.

It will decimate the economy. Corporate earnings will go down. But, the shares of the company will not go down as much as they should, and very well could go up. Limited shares, increased $ supply.

I sense in many ways, this is what has caused our “bull run” of the past, say, 2 years, let alone 4.; Are you concerned at all with these valuations?; When the garbage starts really pumping, it becomes dangerous; We are not in a hyper-inflationary environment. Inflation has existed forever and is actually a good thing when kept at the ~2% target. Claiming that there will never be any crash anymore in any market just because inflation exists is wild.; There will never be a crash again in any market? 

Yeah, I’m sure we’ll never see something like *checks notes*  4 years ago 

Luckily once in a lifetime events don’t happen to often, just ask millennials; No one’s gonna hedge yer junk, dude.; and everyone knew that was coming for the last 4 years.; Do you know what a plateau is?; I thought I was in /r/rebubble for a second there.; Not OP but I’m sitting on about 60% cash more then I have ever and thus missing significant returns ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31225); Wouldn't surprise me. Portfolio contribution time is late February in Canada and I've done it every time and been fucked over by the market only a matter of weeks later.; Sound analysis. However, market does panic sell.; im more concerned when i go to target and see 2 pairs of socks for 15 dollars, or a pack of 6 plain low quality black t shirts for 27 dollars.. Purchase power my guy, purchase power.; Only for those who don’t know how to balance a portfolio.; in more immediate timeframe it'll be a meltup, not a crash (yet); haha lets not split hairs bro we know the fundamentals of the fiat currency. They print more, Dollar lose purchase power, and now 2 pairs of socks costs 15 bucks.; I think you’ve forgotten what subreddit you’re on…; It is an area of relatively level high ground, but it's not important right now.; I'm sitting at 40% +- myself. Time will be the judge; I’m sitting on 100% cash and burning it through time…; Touche ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); On the bright side, Just go to another country and you'll see the purchasing power is there.  Sucks to have to travel abroad to know this but it is what it is.  

I definitely think the economic class divide is widening from those that invest vs. those that gamble/just save.

195,PLTR: They said the quiet part out loud [DD],"On November 15, 2024, PLTR's board member Alex Moore tweeted,

>We are moving PalantirTech to Nasdaq because it will force billions in ETF buying and deliver 'tendies' to our retail investors. Player haters be aware that we've been hated for decades (plural). Everything we do is to reward and support our retail diamondhands following.

Immediately afterwards, he deleted his tweet.

At first glance, the statement seems harmless, and even obvious. Companies are added/removed from passive indexes every day, and it's not a crime to want to deliver shareholder returns. There's no problem with boasting about passive index inclusion. It doesn't affect the fundamental business anyway.

Right?

I think otherwise.

Alex Moore said Palantir's quiet part out loud. I contend that this has been Palantir's gameplan since day one. **The stock's performance**, ridiculous valuation, and mania all **points back to one fundamental goal** of the company's management: **manipulating stock market indexes to juice valuation and provide liquidity for insider selling.**

**The Evidence (s/o Mike Green):**

**Part 1: The Listing**

Companies generally list via a direct listing, traditional IPO, or SPAC. For a company the size of PLTR, a SPAC was out of the question. They had to choose between an IPO and direct listing. Let's take a look at both.

**Traditional IPO**: Typically involves investment banks underwriting the deal, setting a price, and selling shares to institutional investors like mutual funds or hedge funds. Importantly, these shares are **not** part of the stock's free float, and insiders must dilute themselves in order to create new shares to sell on the public market.

**Direct Listing**: In a direct listing, a company offers existing shares directly to the public without issuing new shares or raising capital. This avoids traditional IPO underwriters (investment bank). The free float is immediately determined by shares held by insiders available to sell. Palantir chose this route.

**Takeaway:** In a **direct listing**, all existing shares held by insiders, employees, and early investors become eligible for public trading immediately. There is **no lock-up period** (common in traditional IPOs, where insiders are restricted from selling shares for 6–12 months). This approach ensures a **larger float** right from the start, as insiders can sell their shares directly on the public market if they choose, increasing the number of shares available for trading.

Why is this important?

Palantir almost immediately qualified for index inclusion upon its first day of listing. Vanguard and others were forced to buy shares on the **first week** of listing because Palantir met the necessary requirements for most broad market indexes:

1. Market Cap - This is self explanatory, Palantir began listing at \~17B market cap, rendering it eligible for most indexes.
2. Free Float - Indexes are not just weighted by a company's market cap. The S&P500, for example, uses **Float-Adjusted Market Cap**, adjusting the company’s market capitalization based on its free float to determine its weight in the index. Float-Adjusted Market Cap=Share Price×Free Float Shares
3. Liquidity - Also a no brainer, considering the number of shares immediately available for the public, and the hype around the stock.

It doesn't take a genius to see it. As insiders sell shares, the “effective float” rose, requiring extra purchases from index providers, and helping Palantir insiders exit.

[Vanguard = Liquidity ](https://preview.redd.it/630t26f5vy2e1.jpg?width=801&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b54299e2988d9b42437fe9eb7d9db3f407cf904b)

**Part 2: Buying a Seat at the Table**

2021-2022 was tough for Palantir. The index game was faltering as net income and revenue growth lagged. This threatened their ultimate goal of S&P500 + Nasdaq 100 inclusion. They had the market cap, if they could only find a way to juice their revenue in a profitable way to get themselves over the inclusion requirements!

So, they did what any reasonable company in this situation would do, and bought customers. Financing customer growth by [investing roughly $450MM in over two dozen SPACs](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-11-29/palantir-failed-to-spot-pattern-in-spac-debacle), Palantir was basically [buying revenue.](https://www.newcomer.co/p/is-palantir-buying-revenue)

The process was straightforward:

1. PLTR would invest in the SPAC and assume a significant controlling interest
2. PLTR would use the SPAC's funds to purchase PLTR services
3. Any operating losses of the SPAC company could be carefully hidden from PLTR's reporting.

[Not part of operating income!](https://preview.redd.it/ydfikqj6vy2e1.jpg?width=1254&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=19a6a7d123b4cf926e5dd07b1ce374ac30061bb2)

And, soon enough, PLTR was (technically) reporting profitability by GAAP standards! With the company now profitable, in 2024 it became eligible for SP500 inclusion, and was included in September 2024, coinciding with a face-melting rally.

**Part 3: The Next Frontier**

To wind out its strategy, Palantir wants to maximize the benefits of index inclusion, capped off by its **relisting to Nasdaq** to position itself for entry into the Nasdaq-100 (QQQ).

The timing of the move is also suspect. The index’s modified market cap weighting system limits the concentration of its top three constituents, disproportionately favoring mid-tier companies ranked between #10 and #30 in market cap—exactly where Palantir has maneuvered itself.

This move is no coincidence. Palantir’s ownership by the big three institutional investors—Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street—has soared to an impressive **22.23%**, surpassing even tech giants like **Microsoft (20.5%)**, **Apple (20.0%)**, and **NVIDIA (20.17%)**. For a company that only went public in Q4-2020, this level of institutional backing is ridiculous for a company of this size.

And the insiders? They're loving the exit liquidity.

https://preview.redd.it/2ovaqp09vy2e1.jpg?width=1456&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0c9e88a0d96b9b0e6402d50835979bd1d34530e2

In fact, they've been dumping into the institutions (and retail) this whole time:

https://preview.redd.it/2p4k1qx7vy2e1.png?width=1022&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b0be708d61438cdcf2e779d1216cd3e9696140a

""Show me the incentive, and I will tell you the outcome.""

Institutional shareholders through indexes are the easiest exit liquidity in the world for insiders. They're brainless, rules-based buyers. And, once the entire world owns an equal share of your company, priced at 50x sales, and you've dumped most of your shares, you could give a fuck less what the market ultimately does with your stock!

Of course, index inclusion for this stock has coincided with a complete disconnect from the fundamentals. The net \~3B of projected inflows from the QQQ have contributed about 40-50B of market cap growth in just the past few weeks.

Overall, I think there's huge problems with how companies are intentionally trying to juice themselves into indexes, knowing it's full of bloat and thoughtless exit liquidity. PLTR is just one of many, and they're giving a master class in index manipulation as we speak.

TL;DR: The recent PLTR tweet about joining the QQQ was a deeper insight into strategic yet dubious decisions the company has made for years in order to increase institutional ownership to fund insider selling and pump the stock outside of business fundamentals.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gz9jf7/pltr_they_said_the_quiet_part_out_loud_dd/,1852,2024-11-25 04:26:48,"

[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse); Too bad no one at SEC cares about anything; So what you are saying is that they are masterfully manipulating the price to go up? Sounds like a good reason to buy then.; Shocked PLTR would do anything that even hints at unethical behavior. No way man.; Alright I gotta clear some of this up. This dude went full Charlie corkboard with his conspiracy. It reminds me of Tug Speedmen's performance in ""Simple Jack.""

1. Palantir **did** impose a modified lock-up period, as documented in its SEC filings (Form 8-K and Free Writing Prospectus). While direct listings usually avoid traditional lock-ups, Palantir restricted 80% of insider shares for 6 months until February 2021 (from September 2020 ) after the Q4 2020 earnings release. Insiders (employees, early investors, etc.) were allowed to sell up to **20% of their holdings immediately**.
2. I think you misunderstand what happened with the SPACs- It definitely is a grey area but not illegal so its more like gaming the system. The SPAC revenue did improve Palantir’s reported revenue growth, but profitability (a key factor for S&P 500 inclusion) remained elusive until 2024. SPAC-related revenue didn’t directly manipulate inclusion; it was a short-term boost that eventually faded.

Palantir's growth during this time was largely organic, which makes the argument about ""juicing their books"" with SPAC investments less convincing. Sure, SPACs may have temporarily boosted revenue by locking in software contracts, but how do you sustain that growth and actually become profitable without constantly reinvesting in new SPACs? You don’t.

Palantir didn’t invest in any SPACs in 2023 or 2024, so their profitability by 2024 couldn’t have come from ""artificially inflated revenue"" tied to SPACs. Why? Because not all of those SPAC-backed companies succeeded, and without new SPAC investments to keep the cycle going, they had to shift to real, organic growth to move toward profitability.

Final notes: The S&P 500 requires a company to be **profitable on a GAAP basis** for the most recent quarter and the trailing four quarters combined. Palantir was not GAAP profitable until 2023 for the first time. So they weren't able to be added to the indices right away like you claim.

This is all the time I have to spare for now. Wallstreet is always shady and we don't get to control the game, just participate. The market doesn’t always reward consistent, stable growth; sometimes, it rewards flashy narratives and perceived potential. One day it trades at a 20x multiple then next at 25x just because some analysts or finance bros said so. At the end of the day, the stock market is more of a psychological game than a reflection of financial reality. Right now its shifting towards an AI software narrative, who knows for how long. We're here to ""play the game"" and hit it big. I don't fault you for your thinking but posting this without skin in the game is messed up and not in the spirit of WSB. (I've been long 100 shares @\~23 ).

TL;DR- OP's DD is similar to ""Simple Jack"" and check out the trailer if you aren't aware. OP has easily verifiable misconceptions and no skin in this DD. Stock markets a game.; Where are your positions?; I’m glad they’ve manipulated the market for my portfolio.  Going to buy more now.; Just make the sandwich dude; I mean a lot of this is pretty tinfoil-hatty, but even if you take it at face value, it simply means that management is fully aligned with shareholder interests and is trying to maximize the stock price. 

Edit: A bunch of their RSU’s kick in at $80, so seems like an easy swing trade; None of this matters when they are cornering the DoD AI and software market.; Interesting and detailed DD. It’s refreshing and great to see a DD laid out and the conclusion is “no position”. That is a choice! I think though you maybe missing a nice continuation of the qqq run up?

Any idea when the inclusion will be? And after require significant buying of the stock by institutions that own qqq? 

So I’m asking the hysteria of the pricing of this stock will continue for the foreseeable short term future?; With this going on. I can see [Anduril](https://youtu.be/al9ITeP4fUA?si=DvGj5fw0W5ZQ0IEN) going public next year.; [deleted]; I don't think they are dubious at all; I’ve said for a long time I don’t like the PLTR business strategy:

“Pump us to a $100B+ valuation even though we only make a few hundred million per year…and we can’t tell you exactly what we do…trust us”; Prior to April 2023, the SP500 did not allow any company with multiple share classes to be added to the index.

Palantir has a multiple share class structure, and thus prior to April 2023, being added to the SP500 was not even an option for Palantir.

Your claim that their final goal was to be added to the SP500 from the time of DPO in 2020 makes zero sense, unless you're also claiming that they could also see 3 years into the future to know that the SP500 would change their criteria.

You'd need a real life Palantir to pull that off...; PLTR to the moon; Very insightful post and enlightening on the behavior or these types of companies. I've always wondered how exactly palantir stayed ""profitable"" without really knowing much about product except rumors it's for war. Loved the insight on purchases of SPACs. Great work; I mean I don't really disagree but isn't this what most companies are thinking/doing? PLTR just happen to be better at it.; Who cares is the stock is good or bad… the point is that right now it keeps going up and will make you money 🤷🏻‍♂️.

Been holding 300 shares since $28; I own shares from around the ipo time. I hate the executive suit in this company.  The only reason I bought its because I think they will do immoral things with their softwares and I think humanity will reward them. So far I am doing  well but I have a stop loss. I am ready to sell and never talk again about this turd ever again. ; That's what every company does though; This is what I think is happening to Carvana.  Its majority institutional owned.  Once they pump it enough to be included in all the big indexes, they can start offloading shares onto everyone's 401k.  Easiest exit liquidity ever.; How much you pay for the Bloomberg sub? 

dumping some overworked intern's b-rate analysis on us, and you don't personally have a position is what you are saying?; Todays valuation/price is cray cray. This is a bigger disconnect then Tesla had 2020-2022. Tesla at least had a visble plan that investors could follow.; That sure is allot of words I didn't read 👀; Long as they keep doing work for Israel, they will continue to have institutional backing (BlackRock, State Street, Vanguard). The decision makers of those companies are Jews with Israeli citizenship and have every incentive to dump all of their money to prop this AI beast up. 

You're looking at the next GE, Lockheed, Boeing in the making. Neither one has had a cyber missile and PLTR is delivering whether the numbers make sense or not.; Okay buy calls gotcha; So…💎💎💎✋✋✋; thank god this guy wrote this my calls are gonna moon; It almost seems like they make decisions with retail in mind.  As a Palantard bagholdah, I take this as a positive sign.; With you completely. I’ve long hated these “players.”; Looks to me they are delivering shareholder value——using every trick in the book to make ‘number go up’. That’s what I would want from management as an investor 

That said, great thesis. Plus Karp & co are genuinely evil; You've hit the nail on the head here. Karp has sold over 35 million shares in the past 2 months. These are at all-time highs, and he is now a billionaire. It is clear that insiders are winning big. 

However, it is not clear if this can be sustained or not. My initial thought is that the stock should be imploding and see a 20-30% decrease on the low side. Yet, the actual product of PLTR seems to be a unicorn. It is selling and making lasting impacts in every sector. It could just be the stock that defies typical insight and continues to grow.; Jesus did someone just post actually DD on this sub? Been a minute....; Calls on PLTR?; PLTR is this bubble's MSTR. interestingly both have products in the analytics domain one is propped up by BTC the other is propped up by excellent accounting and playing the markets.. wondering what weird thing will Karp be shilling in twenty years; Sir you are a regard! A company's board member wanting to be included in an index like QQQ or SPX is the same thing as them saying, they want they're stock price to rise. Literally every CEO/CFO on firms that are on the cusp of this, are trying to do this, you don't need a 3 page text to tell us this.; Open a position you fucking pussy; I don’t care as long as it keeps making me filfthy rich.; But pltr wouldn't be that hight of a Price without all those juicy gov/military contracts ad  they wouldn't get those without good product; The stock, like many others, are up 200%+, with Palantir up almost 300% YTD. Institutions aren’t buying, solely retail. This is the worst time to buy practically any stock. Whales are probably going to wait for it to retest the $30-$40 range to buy. 

It’s only a matter of time before earnings expectations get the best of these companies getting crazy valuations above of what they’re actually producing.; over valued stock.; This is great analysis. Thank you.; Really appreciate the insight but I can’t help but think that any company if given a chance would do this and I could only imagine how many already have done it. I am personally invested in PLTR and will be holding for a long time but I am confident that pltr will grow or get closer to its valuation in due time.; So, the play is? Puts in 2025?; This is demonic. 

What do you think the chances are that they get got for this?; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787) so puts then? Puts it is. Puts.; too fucking much to read someone explain like im the way I am; That’s a lotta words… too bad I ain’t reading em; This is fine because it would give me a place to dump my stupid covered calls without costing me all of the unrealized gains of the shares.; If they were taking this higher, why is Karp selling billions?; [deleted]; I got so lucky on Planters calls last week. They announced their NASDAQ up listing on a day the market was beat red. That was like a 500% gain holding those calls for 5 days
Just dumb luck.; Great DD. Thanks for the input; RemindMe! 1 day; That hair… who electroshocked him before that photo?; When buy PUTS?; We could do catx next. It's just sitting there waiting; This is how most companies work, until they don’t.; Trump being elected has shown only one thing. There are no rules any more. As always proceed with caution. A buy sign here imo. ; To make a poker analogy, this man folded pre flop. He didn't like the cards or the position at the table.  Often the wisest choice.; Fascinating read. Thanks for posting.

I think it was Charlie Munger, quite a few years ago, who said something to the effect of ""If enough people index, it's not going to work out well.""

Things that cannot go on forever will stop, but when and how is anyone's guess. Smart not to short.; This is r/WSB... r/investing is that way 👉

Great analysis by the way. With the growth in passive index fund trackers, it was probably inevitable that some companies would try to game the system. And it undoubtedly leads to other unintended consequences with concentrations of risk due to compounding effect of weightings in the event of a sector bubble.; Call me when Karp sells controlling shares in Palantir and I'll lift an eye brow. I'm fully aware Palantir isn't worth 64$ but I don't feel like selling so I guess I belong here:

I'm going to pretend I didn't see this.; Sooooo.... Buy?; Interesting DD/PSA……you short?; This was a fundamental reason I didn’t re enter after I sold my shares in early 2021, I felt it was confidently an exit play by insiders given the massive share selling the ceo was doing; They did it right at the start as well - opened up 50+’s and their board members were selling by the bucket load which had a big sentiment on why it went downs to the 7-8’s. Once they apparently ‘banned’ these Execs from selling so much so quickly (and the good results) has led it to go up again. Watch Thai space as the rest of the board offload; No skin in the game (like zero?) in the wsb sub makes all of this elaborate DD extremely sus.  If OP can do this much deep dive DD, he should put his fucking money where his mouth is.; Can anyone tell me what the fuck they even do because their website doesn’t even tell me.; Meh. Let me know when Karp combs his hair, then I might consider selling; Always thought what they were doing w the SPACs was fishy even if I didn’t quite understand it. Thanks for detailed post; I don’t have time to read all that. Calls or puts? Strike price and expiration?; https://preview.redd.it/zgqsqxm1j13e1.jpeg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0d9ae0b208681fcf085972cebd6db53576fafe3; People who think Blackrock & Vanguard own everything are flat earthers of wall street

of course being listed on nasdaq will increase trading of your company; Karp’s open obsession with “burning the shorts” is weird as fuck for a guy trying to portray himself as the quirky mad scientist type ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640); >The net ~3B of projected inflows from the QQQ have contributed about 40-50B of market cap growth

Not only will PLTR be receiving this new index funding after the Nov 29th snapshot for the Nasdaq 100 inclusion, but AXON and MSTR too. 

At the time of the writing, the market caps of each are:
PLTR: $146.5B
AXON: $48B
MSTR: $97B

The higher the market cap snapshot, the higher the funding.; https://preview.redd.it/ask7y7amm23e1.jpeg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d843808489dd0e6cefa6012fe14acd242f4908ef; They support a genocide so there is that; Somebody is seeking attention..................; Virtual you should sell now and back when it is lower.
Time and time again we have seen Tech stocks get recognized and bought by EVERYONE which leads to a higher price and a higher valuation .I find it interesting that so many could not figure out the way Palantir makes money and has so much cash on hand with no debt but now they are coming out of the woodwork with investing models that prove Palantir is not a good investment.The very next day it goes up because EVERYONE is buying.When you have owned Palantir shares for a few years you have seen it all and heard it all and you just hold onto the shares in the company you know and believe in.There is no Power Point required to figure this out,this is how Wall Street works and this is how a company becomes imbedded in the United States government,it just took time.Time for the US commercial market to see the real winners and time for other governments to start coming on board.You are either in or you are out.I’m in Brother and I have been for years.; Every company does this, CFOs ask us all the time about flows from passive AUM. They are paid on stock price performance not free cash flow generation.; Shit you are a smart dude; Thank god for this post, I was beginning to worry that PLTR stock was going to drop. Now that this DD has made the front page it’s free tendies for me; There is no conclusive evidence that index inclusion juices valuation. The academic evidence is clear and points to a temporary price effect. One thing it does is dry up liquidity as passive holders are largely buy and hold, but liquidity in the name is plentiful and there is scope for the owners to sell more shares > increasing float and eventually larger index weighting. I dont think they are gaming this, because the effect of inclusion is not a permanent observation. Plenty of stocks have been added to Sp5 and Ndx100 without the price observation we see in PLTR, which is ultimately driven by its fundamentals and a shift in AI focus from hardware to software and services in the AI space.; Yes, PLTR is super over valued and is a great short target for when it blows up

Also you’re going to lose a fuck of a lot of money shorting it for the foreseeable future since everyone and their brother loves buying 200+ PEs right now.; Short or gtfo pussy; Here's the kicker.  Google ""stock performance after addition to index"".  It outperforms initially and then underperforms.  

I've been long for a while but plan on getting out here soon.  It will almost no doubtably underperform for a good period unless liquidity is dumped into the market.  It will ride the wave.; All this talk about whether PLTR going up or down. All I wanna know is what’s the latest company trying this strategy so I can buy in early!?; Instructions clear: short indexes.....?

No, no, that can't be right....

Instructions unclear.; Position or GTFO.; Did I miss positions in there?; Yes very obvious what they are doing, but judgement day will come.

Unfortunately not the insiders will be the victim of that - but the common shareholder.; It’s funny how you have posts like this but last year when we hardly scratched 20$ a share we are the worst company ever.; As an early PLTR retail investor, I approve this of this strategy.; Thank you, sir. May I have more shares, please.; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) Impressive use of a lot of words to say absolutely nothing. Wake me when Palantir is a trillion dollar company in the next few years.; Palantir is still an evil company. Ask anyone in government.; Palantir to 450; I’m sorry I read all that and am confused on what OP is trying to say? Is he saying this is bullish for PLTR? thank you; The quiet part is that they enthusiastically back Israel's genocide.; Honestly the fact that their CEO looks like that is bearish; Awesome work. Thank you. And I've been slaughtered more than any stock in my life by this piece of shit company.; Great fucking DD; Palantir is and always has been a bunch of shitheads; Great work, thanks for sharing! I will look to buy long dated puts on this and MSTR after they join the Nasdaq-100; Been loading since the IPO. Love the company.

Not talking about them making money, or making others money. Do what you do.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*; What flavor of crown is this, Bullshit?!

(seriously though, well done on the write up); 1. 20% over 6 months is nothing. Traditional IPO lockups are 180 days and 100% of insider holdings. But I wasn't making any commentary on their lockup strategy. It's more about how a direct listing juices free float, which juices index inclusion.
2. I didn't say anything they did was illegal. I did say it was gaming the system. Their fundamentals are not as good as they seem in GAAP principles. Weighing the evidence, it seems that PLTR used these SPACs to juice revenue in a way that hides unprofitability, which assists with SP500 inclusion.

I also didn't say that their initial listing got them on the SP500. It propel them in many other stock indexes, though, especially with their juiced free float for a newly listed company. And, those index flows disproportionately inflated the stock.

Finally, I don't need to short a stock disconnected from fundamentals to feel good about my analysis. I just refuse to play the game with these sorts of stocks.

It is truly regarded that people think the ""stock markets a game"" and that's an acceptable, reasonable opinion. Fundamentals always matter, they will matter in the end. You're not just buying magical numbers on a screen, you're buying a portion of a business and its earnings and assets in perpetuity. So, yes, it matters if they're ""gaming the system"".; No position. While it would make sense to short the stock on fundamentals, the stock is completely disconnected from fundamentals for the reasons described above, I don't see a reason that this would go away. I'm also not interested in shorting in general because of the infinite risk, especially when detached from fundamentals, I can just choose to not invest.; I'll share positions - $65 11/29 calls x2 contracts cost me $300 whole bucks lol; Me too, my portfolio exploded this year, up 284% because of PLTR.; https://preview.redd.it/tdhuwfgfmz2e1.jpeg?width=984&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=292380a6268881aa9c969565e73819f86327ec24; This is why my fries are always cold ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260); I don't understand how RSU's would have an affect on the stock price. Could you expand on that?; I agree, the real questionable activity is the indexes.; Are you saying they will pump it to 80 for sure?; Yupppp, us retail investors are quite happy to have the sky high valuation. Enjoy sitting on the sidelines ;); The issue is if they don't actually fulfill the expectations they've created long term, in which case a lot of this value goes poof. Shareholder interests are that it continues growing; not everyone can sell at the top.; Yet they are not hiring AI experts. Check their career page. Weird, no?; And J powel will not let it sink; Exactly, if AI if the future warfare than the contracts they will receive from the gov will be astronomical. Cybersecurity is becoming of our version of life or death for humans everyday we move forward into technology; Pelosis has PANW.; True but they are very likely to get blacklisted by Europeans for their delusional approach to Human Rights issues. Norway has already divested and there is considerable risk involved when stories on ""Where’s Daddy"" start breaking out.; > I think though you maybe missing a nice continuation of the qqq run up?

Might as well buy a company he believes in rather than try to ride a bubble before it bursts.; That would be good candidate for DD; That is unobviously obvious. Puts it is…back to the drawing board; They sell ""software"" to governments and public (and recently private) sectors that can aggregate data from multiple sources easily and also process satellite imagery and telemetry in a way that the military and law enforcement can use. 

The pricing model of their ""software"" is that they pay a license similar to COTS, but starts low entry cost for consulting services to develop and provide the continual upkeep past implementation, then yearly licensing fees thereafter. This is also probably how they progress new products through R&D. I assume they use the client's money to develop out new products. 

I think their ""software"" is similar enough to Esri (which is privately traded) and Snowflake. To perform data transformation work at scale is difficult for any software stack and typically involves the use of AWS Glue or Azure Data Factory which are pretty complex PaaS / SaaS to run and operate. My hunch is that they've simplified this operationally and provided end users with the tools to transform data quickly. 

Not sure this is worth the current valuation, but my guess is that data will continue to compound across all sectors without a unified way to process and aggregate leading to their continued success. That's my hypothesis anyway.; His SPAC argument is really dumb and straight up wrong. Those investments were a great blunder and PLTR only lost on them. The ""bought revenue"" was absolutely miniscule and the SPACs are mostly trash. Seriously, look them up. Thankfully that was only a very small investment overall and PLTR is still debt free and has a big cash pile. They got profitable by growing their customer base, more contracts, more revenue, while keeping the costs low. The old fashioned way. Yes, they are doing accounting tricks like everyone does but those are not GAAP. PLTR is GAAP profitable.; Why not sell now?; Palantirs plan is really visible.

The stock was already going parabolic before the announcement of moving the listing from NYSE to Nasdaq.  Not sure what you are saying about PLTR growing by 50Billion in market cap after this market listing move.  Most growth stock are expensive when you look at traditional financial metrics.  Hopefully there's been a lot of holders here who had bought in at lower price, like under $35-40 range.  This was the recent stock price before the recent announcement.  As to price to sales/valuation disconnect, sometimes the market stays like this for a very long time.  Like how PLTR stock price has been really under pressure over the last couple of years, it was just 2024 that it started to show signs of recovery and the recent break out.  So I would say you are still sane not to short it even if you you really believe what you are saying in your post.; Most of the market is now completely disconnected from any fundamentals which is fine when everythings shits and giggles

Its when the music stops (and it always has a history of stopping just when nobody thinks it will )

You're not alone in your assessment; If you bought at 10 dollars... would you sell those shares now @ 65?; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640); I thought a short down to 30 was necessary when it flew to 40 so suddenly. If they are engineering revenue, the market sees it as *AI Revenue* so it’s always going to be part of the general ai trend. 

This stock really does feel like it will get annihilated on a downtrend.; Has Karp commented on the current share price rally? Last time it spiked he criticised speculators and outright stated that the share price would drop until 2024 (at which point suppressing effects would drop and he estimated a value of around $30/share)


30 seems a ""reasonable"" price right now.; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31224); You sound like a salty little bitch.

As u/Krim_19 elegantly outlined (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/jr5GTwd8Za) your little fantasy story is full of holes.

In any case, sorry you missed out on ~~getting rich~~ investing in this once in a lifetime company op. Better luck next time.; Ban him; Ban.; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); You can report them, just saying. ; exercise and sell ?; [deleted]; hm. interesting observation.; They already are the ai experts. Nobody is better. It’s like the US military trying to hire out assassins. There isn’t any need to since we’re already the best at it, so why even list it as “need ai expert.”. They will make you one.; Only explanation: DoD guys are PLTR holders and when Russia/China hack DoD again, they'll resign and live happily on their private islands that Karp provided them; Quite possible they are already staffed. 

Also, defense contractors don’t always solicit jobs (especially in the classified space) with a lot of specificity. Sometimes, it’s just a canned job description with a clearance req’t in an “advanced technology” environment. You get hired and sit in a boring transition role for 6-12months while your clearance and accesses are dispositioned. Then voila - you get assigned to a building with no windows or 2 way communication devices. Welcome to the closed world.; If Europeans want to divest that is their prerogative. I don’t think that would have much impact on PLTR’s stock performance besides a temporary volume variance for a day or two. 

I don’t think Europe is as monolithic as you are portraying. The Dutch had a defense product export ban on end use for the IDF…until they completely reversed it a few months later. They quickly realized that an end-use ban would remove them from the US defense supply chain which would have some very meaningful adverse impacts to their indigenous defense base. They chose Dutch jobs over foreign policy. Possibly other countries go in a different direction but I don’t the see larger EU states changing. They would have done so already.; Their continued success is more than priced in.  That’s the issue.  They have literal miracles priced in.; You nailed it right there; > Not sure this is worth the current valuation


Karp himself gave a 2024 estimate of $30/share. It's massively over-valued, again. I'd love to know karp's thoughts right now, though. Last time it was in a speculation bubble he went out his way to criticise people buying at the speculative price and outright stated the company wasn't worth that much.; > Azure Data Factory ... pretty complex PaaS / SaaS to run and operate

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/jr5GTwd8Za; Pulther; I can not argue that the markets will be wild beyond what you are familiar with. I have 1 tell tail signal that always has spoke when we will get a huge downturn ( or bear market ), when I see someone's kid on the tv saying that the kid is the best stock picker ever. Always ... 1987 saw it, 1999 saw it, 2007 saw it 3 times in the summer BOOM that was a bear market... but like everything else it has to show up on some sort of common media nation wide viewing... 

I was there physically to enjoy the crash of 1987 and I was on the floor around the afternoon for a little while. What was scary was the crowds outside. Locally, it devastated the tri state economy, nation wide it was not so bad. 

farm aid was 1985, so that was the shakeout for that sector

1978-1984 super high interest rates caused the rust belt, so they were recovering. 

1980-1991 we were fighting the cold war, so business in military was doing great. 

banks were lending money but bank fraud was crazy everywhere, look up RTC the resolution Trust corp that was made to resolved that problem in 1989 or 1991; More like government officials will be lining their pockets for companies that buy them off for turning a blind eye.; i can't tell you how many times I've heard this over the last 10 years.  Basically every time the market gets frothy.  Imagine someone who stayed on the sidelines from 2014 on and how much wealth they've missed out on.

The entire policy of the largest and most powerful institution in the history of the world (the US federal government) is built around a asset appreciation at all costs.  It doesn't matter if they have to dilute your dollar, go to war, etc.  Stonks will keep going up.; Great depression levels happens if something breaks and if you know what will break and when, then the market prices that in ahead of time, so, barring a Black Swan event, I think a technically worse prospect for investors is a market like we saw from 2000-2002. Just a 40% decline that happened slowly. drip drip drip...; RemindMe! 1 year; 1930’s Depression 2030’s Depression; Thiel and Vance's bromance; Peter Thiel is JD Vance's political benefactor sponsor whatever person.; Peter Thiel, I'm assuming; True. I was thinking about Suit with Sean Cahill character. Dude just fuck around threatening people left and right (tbf everyone was) and handed his corrupted boss a jail sentence lasting 10-15 years for suspicion of corruption and taking bribery from a billionaire mogul. Mtfk really said ""sure make 50 shell company, I'll have all of their license revoked by the morning"".  Dude was a beast. 

edit: mtfk also said: ""you cant hide money from the SEC"" lmao 

https://youtu.be/IMJuhBzdiOQ?si=gQHPIhDSVy6A3lXG&t=363


Then there is Billion and irl SEC; I really thought this entire post was just an elaborate reverse shittymorph circle jerk where the ridiculous part is at the beginning.

But he actually posted that?; One thing I've learned is that whatever we think is priced in is either priced in more than it should be or not priced in enough. There's never a perfect balance; Falling knife situation; Just do the opposite of what I do. I sold all of mine and bought puts before last quarter results.; That is entirely up to the individual and their ability to get up from the table with their winnings.; Institutional ownership continues to rise. PLTR is no longer a retail investor stock.; Hahahahah yoooo wtf 😂; 😂😂😂 comments here never disappoints; Imagine thinking DD is a problem while you’re out here offering zero, get a hobby; Rekt.; Calls on southwestern!; No , value is becoming a thing of the past; HMC, VOD, NWN; Cigarette stonks. I bought some even though I hate smokers. Get lung cancer while making be rich 😎. Either the future has more smokers and I make a good profit or the future has less smokers and the scorge goes away.; wow stealing this lol; I always find it interesting how people saw PLTR as a bad buy back in it $8/share days.


It was very openly going to drop after hitting the market, with karp explaining why and even calling retail buyers at the initial spike idiots and explicitely saying it was going to crash for a while. Exactly as was laid out back at launch, those suppressing effects have cleared up and allowed the current rally.


Im curious what karp thinks now, though. His estimate was for 30/share for 2024, and he was criticising people who were speculating on price. I'd say it's a good individual stock to hold, but massively over-valued.;     I have bought at 6.5 and I am not selling for now; *hello officer… yes I’d like to report that I’m poor because I’m a dumb bitch that didn’t see that Palantir is a once in a lifetime company… boo hoo*; RSUs are not options, they’re straight up stock grants; Why would they want their own options to expire worthless?; Hahahahahahaa; That’s a logic explanation, not like some morons above thinking they are “already the AI experts” lol; Imagine the price any given government body would pay to be able to properly understand their data across all storage types and formats. Assume they're already using Snowflake but still have to process and massage the data to analyze it and need something akin to the role of a traditional mainframe to aggregate and transform everything. 

Does it make sense that PLTR have a higher market cap than SNOW? Probably not. If they ran a PaaS offering or were more directly in competition with Azure or AWS then they'd skew higher. I assume a bit of wiggle room due to how I think their pricing model works but I have no hard numbers other than P/E to tell me it's prob massively overpriced.; I meant more AWS Glue. If you've never tried to network components and transform with with Glue and Athena it's not trivial for an end-user. It's fine if you do this all day long but we're talking about IT for a local County, not your run of the mill neck beards. They only have a handful of those on staff; Who cares when you can make money 😂 If it’s going up anyway I might as well benefit! I will at least do good with my money. 

My goals are to be able to be financially well off to do pediatric cardiac nursing trips (I’m a peds cvicu nurse) in countries like Rwanda or Iraq. I could do these now but it’s a lot harder to use all my PTO to do it and then miss out on time with family because I don’t have a pto. Etc etc; Well, let us non-tv-watching folk know when you see the kid!; it seems like this administration is going to be a lot like the savings and loan crisis.  everyone is going to know what's going on, but everyone is going to hope a bigger fool comes along to hold their bags.; 4288 UNITS! BOOM!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*; Saw it in 2021 as well.  CNBC featured some kid in high school that was throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks.; You forget when Japanese Banks lead the world into a recession when they gave money out with a handshake and a promise to pay back (literally) and that’s when the State of Hawaii was 80% ish properties, both commercial & residential, was owned by Japan. They crashed and Hawaii’s economy tanked.; Agreed.  The risk being out of the market long term outweighs the black swan event risk.   It'll hurt but I highly doubt you have a situation of permanent loss of capital.  Unless you're rich af, why try to time the crash?  

People love to sound smart and then it hurts their ego when they're wrong.  We'll hear ""it's rigged"" and all the other complaints too.; I literally didn’t say to cash out though. I’m keeping my 401k in the market. I’m just saying it will crash. If you think this time is like all the rest you are asleep.; OP is Jeremy Grantham; You seriously can’t be comparing the 2014 stock market to 2024.; What do you think 'broke' for the great depression, or 2008?

|-|-|-|-|; I think the correct term is fuck daddy; There is no falling knife while a stock is rising lol; Falling knife? 😆  I don't think you know what that means; DD without a bet is like promoting a recipe you haven't made yet.; I love you, op (I haven't checked your post history yet, so please don't be weird); Shut up nerd 🤓; Well done. The post is on the mark from the looks of it. Epic research; Your post bold down to ""PLTR are trying to increase their stock price!""

Embarrassing that you think this is some novel insight.; Mmm…. feeling like ‘01. Pure euphoria. Let’s pump everything to the moon!; They don’t, and RSU are restricted stock units, not options.; Why laughing? You’re over here with and STD somehow losing money on tsla and multiple other companies. 

I’m over here + $90k on since I started a few years ago_ Whose advice you taking?; Again, more than priced in; Wait til u see CVNA P/E; Do you have TikTok?  Because it’ll be bombarded, even more so, with 18 year old investors slinging their strategy of guaranteed money.; Funny that you ask ... 

I am watching Fox and nbc TV to see if it happens. Those 2 control a large mass of stock market investors viewers ( general public viewers, not like those that watch Bloomberg all day ); what does that mean?; I was on the lookout for that "" kid "", never saw it and missed the trade lol; >We'll hear ""it's rigged"" and all the other complaints too.

I'll do you one even better than this.  I'd say it's definitely rigged, and betting against the guys who have enough power and money to fucking rig financial markets is one of the stupidest things a person can do, especially wen they can just take the same side of the trade as the guys doing the rigging.; I'm trying to learn can you explain this to me a bit? In terms of strategy for a regular person with some $ in stocks?

""Unless you're rich af, why try to time the crash?""; so this time its different... but also dont sell?; Think it’s over valued but that doesn’t mean it’s can’t go up some more.; Why would you voluntarily keep your money in the market if your sentiment is a crash incoming?

Sticking it to the man?; I don’t think anybody expected Bear Sterns or Lehman to go out of business due to these insurance instruments that collapsed with the housing market. 

Covid and the SVB debacle were peanuts compared to 2008 and those were both risky events that not many folks predicted (at least Covid wasn’t until it was); RemindMe! 1 year to remind you in 1 year; Apparently the only allowed fdaddys are the liberal ones?; You sound jealous or even scorned.
Get over the hurt and find a new F Daddy, big guy; When you're talking about shorting, shorting a stock that's on a tear would still be trying to catch a falling knife. We can say ""flying knife"" if it makes you feel better.; DD is just diligent consideration before an investment decision. That decision can be one of four things: buy, sell, hold or pass. 

Any one of those is a valid outcome for a rational person, but I agree not for a degenerate gambling forum.; Using DD to decide not to bet is the smartest move I've seen on this sub. No wonder apes find it confusing.; I laid out pretty clearly why I don't personally want to short. My bet is not buying PLTR. That's good enough for me.; Guarantee you this guy makes infinitely more than you trading with how you people reply. If his track record is anything like mine then he’s well off.; Hard disagree.; it’s really not. 

you’re comparing a firsthand endorsement to stock price divergence. 

if he tries the recipe, that directly gives him an expert opinion on that recipe.

if he goes short, it doesn’t give him expert opinion on the stock nor does it make the decoupling of stock fundamentals and stock price any more likely to became rational.

granted, him going short shows the conviction of his DD …. and without a bet i’m not sure the point of the DD being posted here rather than r/stocks etc

but the recipe promotion nah that’s a bad analogy. 

it’s more like taking a look under your car hood and finding a problem, but deciding not to fix it cuz u think it’s not worth the cost and you think the dealership is gonna fuck ya anyhow; Shorting is difficult to time, so I don’t think OP is to blame; That rhymes...; Seriously, positions or ban was a good policy; ☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️; Just because you thought of an analogy doesn't make it meaningful. To try to bring sense to your shitty analogy, here: OP is promoting a dish they have made and tasted, but not willing to sell to others just yet at their restaurant.; Might as well be shilling a crypto at this point; It’s a mashup of beastiality, scat porn, and vintage cock ring collecting.; I don't think they're getting RSUs though, they're convertible bonds, which function like options. But from what I understand now, they hedge them with shorts, making them neutral to the stock price movement after its climbed a certain amount, so they want to roll them over to bonds with higher ""strike prices"" (not sure it's the same terminology).; Well, I've trimmed down to 1500 shares. I am considering cutting that in half since I am reading something here about RSUs kicking in at $80. If they're goosing based on market index inclusion then I don't mind exiting some early and keeping half to ride out whatever comes in the future.; I don’t have TikTok but I just assumed that happened non stop regardless of how the market was doing.; Nope TikTok is a chinese spy company trying to make us communists.; Nope, screw tiktok, they put awful music over everything.; Np.  Most of us don't have the luxury of waiting for a crash in the markets.  You're missing the potential to compound growth.  There's a phrase ""it's time in the market, not timing the market that leads to success"".   

People like Warren Buffett and ultra wealthy can sit on cash forever and never run out.  It's the normies that need to participate in the growth of markets to one day retire with a nice nest egg.  There's less to protect if you've got a small nest egg.  Rich folk have more to protect and you could make the argument to be a market timer... but still a pretty foolish thing to try and do long term.; It’s ALWAYS different this time. Just like last time; Because timing the market is impossible. And printing money is easy for the government. The small guys will loose. 🤷‍♂️; Because it might go up exponentially before the crash; Ah, didn't know we were buying puts on the company that has 3x'd in the past 60 days. I guess that is alot like catching a falling knife. Or like cutting off your own dick with a spoon, however you want to visualize it.; This level of post is too intelligent for the 0 iq regards of this sub unfortunately; This was awesome. Ignore the clowns. They said the same thing when SMCI was pumped into index inclusion. Same with Tesla. 
Passive investing is def not as straightforward anymore.; Hey OP this was fascinating. I dont know if i fully agreee but a lot to think about. Sign me up for your newsletter!; I'd actually argue you laid out a pretty great case for buying. Not fanatical buying, but strategic buying. The theory of reflexibity says when you spot a bubble, the smart thing to do is buy into it.; You are a gift to society.; That’s not a bet though that’s just doing nothing; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31224); I want to short it; Hey man I actually appreciate the well thought out DD. Reminds me of the pre gamestonk days when this sub was actually worth something.; Oh it definitely happens a lot but it’s just like Reddit. You’ll see more posts in WSB, more in Crypto subreddits, more in sub Reddits with actual stock advice, etc; Yea I’m not sure this is a good tell anymore just because there is so much of it all the time. Gone are the days when a parent would let a kid have access to a brokerage. Now every kid can download Reddit and throw in their allowance.; True, I'm glad you said this because risk management doesn't mean going to cash to wait.  You can rebalance your portfolio and tilt to a defensive posture.  People get overly emotional and think in binary terms.  (All in or all out.); What else did you think we were doing?; TSLA doesn't even make any sense anymore.; Fundamentally dodgy bubbles are predictable wealth generators. 

99% of the regards here would be behind Wendy’s without them. ; Pretty sure that doing something else with your capital is a bet.; how about u eat my ASS

FTFY.; TSLA hasn't made sense for a while and with Elon being basically the President, I'm sure it'll continue to not make sense for a long time; Piss or get off the pot. 

You are all hat and no cattle.; Stop calling the kettle black; if you can't handle the heat, get out of the kitchen.

You're on thin ice, buddy, so quit barking up the wrong tree before you dig that hole any deeper.; You are all whine and no chill"
196,How are you thinking about your portfolio given the outcome of the 2024 US Election?,"As the new Trump administration takes office in 2025, we will all grapple with a rapidly evolving economic landscape. The anticipated policies promise significant shifts reminiscent of Hungary's economic transformation.   Please let me know if you agree or disagree with any of the picks below...

# Understanding the Policy Shifts

**1. Economic Nationalism and Protectionism**

The administration's ""America First"" agenda is expected to:

* **Increase Tariffs on Imports**: Tariffs could rise by 10-25%, mainly targeting Chinese goods. This move aims to protect domestic industries but may lead to higher consumer prices.
* **Promote Onshoring**: Incentives for companies to relocate manufacturing to the U.S. could include tax breaks and subsidies.

**Impact Analysis:**

* **Beneficiaries**: Domestic manufacturers like **Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT)** and **3M Company (NYSE: MMM)** could see increased demand due to reduced competition from imports.
* **Potential Losers**: Companies reliant on imported materials or global supply chains like **Apple** may face higher production costs and supply-chain disruptions.

**2. Deregulation and Tax Cuts**

Anticipated measures include:

* **Corporate Tax Reductions**: Lowering the rate from 21% to 15% could significantly boost net earnings.
* **Deregulation Efforts**: Especially in energy and finance, rolling back regulations like Dodd-Frank could reshape industry operations.

**Impact Analysis:**

* **Financial Sector Gains**: Banks like **JPMorgan Chase** and **Goldman Sachs** might experience increased profitability due to relaxed lending regulations and lower taxes.
* **Energy Sector Surge**: Traditional oil and gas companies like **Exxon Mobil Corporation** and **Chevron Corporation** could benefit from reduced environmental regulations and expanded drilling rights.

**3. Increased Government Intervention**

Potential actions:

* **Sector-Specific Policies**: Favoring industries aligned with national priorities, possibly leading to subsidies for sectors like defense and infrastructure.
* **Unpredictable Regulatory Changes**: Sudden policy shifts could affect long-term planning and investment.

**Impact Analysis:**

* **Defense Contractors Advantage**: Companies like **Lockheed Martin** and **Northrop Grumman** may secure lucrative government contracts amid increased defense spending.
* **Risk of Cronyism**: Firms with close ties to the administration could outperform, while others may struggle to compete.

# What Lessons Can We Learn from Hungary Under Viktor Orbán

* **Nationalization and Heavy Taxation**: Foreign companies faced significant taxes, reducing foreign investment.
* **Favoritism Towards Domestic Firms**: Companies aligned with government objectives received advantages, distorting competition.
* **Market Volatility**: Unpredictable policies led to investor uncertainty and capital flight.

**Application to the U.S. Context:**

* **Regulatory Risk**: Investors should be wary of sudden policy changes that could impact sectors like technology and healthcare.
* **Importance of Government Relations**: Companies investing in government lobbying and aligning with national priorities may fare better.

# Sector-Specific Investment Opportunities and Risks

**1. Sectors Poised for Growth**

* **Energy Sector**
   * *Analysis*: With deregulation and a focus on energy independence, traditional energy companies will likely expand operations.
   * *Investment Picks*: Consider **Halliburton** for oilfield services and **Phillips 66** for refining and midstream operations.
   * *Commodities Impact*: Expect a potential rise in crude oil prices due to increased domestic demand, making investments in oil futures or ETFs like the **United States Oil Fund LP (NYSEARCA: USO)** attractive.
* **Financial Services**
   * *Analysis*: Deregulation could lead to increased lending and investment banking activities.
   * *Investment Picks*: Regional banks like **(NYSE: PNC)** may benefit from economic growth and deregulation.
* **Defense and Infrastructure**
   * *Analysis*: Increased government spending in defense and infrastructure projects.
   * *Investment Picks*: Infrastructure companies like **(NYSE: VMC)** and **Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM)** could see increased demand for construction materials.

**2. Sectors Facing Headwinds**

* **Healthcare and Pharmaceuticals**
   * *Analysis*: Potential reforms aiming to reduce drug prices could squeeze profit margins.
   * *Investment Risks*: Companies like **Pfizer** and **Merck** may face pricing pressures.
   * *Considerations*: Biotech firms focusing on innovative treatments may be less impacted.
* **Renewable Energy**
   * *Analysis*: A shift away from climate initiatives could reduce subsidies and support for renewable energy projects.
   * *Investment Risks*: Companies like **First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ: FSLR)** and **NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NEE)** might experience slowed growth.
   * *Commodities Impact*: Potential decrease in demand for renewable energy commodities like lithium and rare earth elements.
* **Technology and Multinationals**
   * *Analysis*: Tariffs and trade barriers could disrupt global supply chains.
   * *Investment Risks*: Tech giants like **Microsoft** and **Alphabet** might face international market challenges.

# Navigating Market Volatility

**Strategies to Mitigate Risks:**

* **Defensive Stocks**: Consider utilities and consumer staples companies like **The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE: PG)** and **Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE: DUK)**, which tend to be more stable during market fluctuations.
* **Gold and Precious Metals**: Historically seen as a haven, investing in gold through **SPDR Gold Shares (NYSEARCA: GLD)** or mining companies like **Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE: GOLD)** can hedge against volatility.

# Exploring International Investment Opportunities

**Emerging Markets Resilience:**

* **India**
   * *Analysis*: With a domestic solid growth trajectory, India is less exposed to U.S. policy changes.
   * *Investment Picks*: **HDFC Bank Limited (NYSE: HDB)** offers exposure to India's growing middle class.
* **Taiwan and South Korea**
   * *Analysis*: Key semiconductor and AI supply chain players are potentially insulated from U.S.-China trade tensions.
   * *Investment Picks*: **Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd**.

**Other Potential Diversification Plays:**

* **International ETFs**: Investing in funds like **iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSEARCA: EEM)** provides broad exposure to emerging markets.
* **Commodities**: Diversifying with commodities like copper and nickel, essential for global infrastructure and technology, can capitalize on international demand.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gyxypj/how_are_you_thinking_about_your_portfolio_given/,0,2024-11-24 19:36:08,"Thanks I also have Chat GPT; Cannot predict, and neither can anyone else. 

Been buying steadily since 1976 and will continue. ; Don't try to time the market.


I just continue to buy ; Yawn. Nothing changes.; Political markets are short legged. Just keep averaging in.; I’m quite excited.; Stuff like that (and more recently valuation) is why I hold about 30% ex-US. I’m not planning any changes. 

I’d love to believe more in emerging markets. I *kind of* do, I hold a few Latin American companies I think have great potential. As the [last 20 years have shown](https://www.theemergingmarketsinvestor.com/a-tale-of-two-decades-for-emerging-markets-and-the-sp-500/) though, rising standards of living don’t necessarily translate to a booming stock market. ; I appreciate that you put together this post to prompt discussion, but sadly /r/investing has just become /r/Bogleheads v2. Not that Boglehead advice is bad or wrong, I just wish there was a bit more nuanced discussion here.; Continue buying; I predict new all time highs for things like for-profit prisons, pay-day loans, liquor, gambling, dollar stores, etc.; He who buys the most stocks is buried in the largest stocking; ""Don't try to time the market"" is solid advice, and I agree with that generally. But what I'm talking about here isn't timing short-term market fluctuations. It's about strategically positioning for the long term based on significant policy shifts. Adjusting investments in response to anticipated changes from the new administration isn't market timing—it's long-term investing.; But Bogleheads are necessary so others may profit :-); I am... but the question is... buying what...   To simplify the question: what do you think about the long-term view of these: CAT, MMM, JPM, GS, Exxon, Chevron, Northrop, Lockheed, PNC, VMC, MLM, PG, DUK, GLD, GOLD, HDB, Samsung, EFA

over these: AAPL, Pfizer, Merck, FSLR, NEE, MSFT, Google

given the new administration...; This comment, but especially your original post reek of chatgpt; Just continue investing and diversifying in an S&P500 or Total Stock Market Index Fund, and/or small/mid/large cap growth and value, international, and some bond funds. 

If you’re concerned about the next administration, why would you gamble by buying individual stocks?

Additionally, the premise of your original post is based on the next 4-years, while this question is asking opinions on the long-term prospects of specific stocks based on the next 4-years, which is impossible to predict, and provides even more reason to just continue buying low cost index funds.; Index funds, which outpace most retail investors who stock pick.


You can't time the market.; Maybe I spend too much time with robots, but I assure you that I am primarily human... my wife may disagree...

But let's go with this for a moment. I am now curious from a theoretical perspective. Let's say it was generated by a financially oriented AI—why would that make the question (or my comment) any less significant?; The individual companies are meant as examples of successful companies people would recognize in that sector…"
197,Speculate on GOOG - what'd be the best countermove against DoJ slaps? ,"For those who were sleeping/partying on the weekend, the following happened:

* DoJ said, Google should divest off Chrome and may not reenter the browser market for five years
* prohibited from ""acquiring any interests in search rivals, potential entrants, and rival search or search ads-related AI products""
* halt all ""anticompetitive payments to distributors, including Apple, Samsung"" so that Google isn't the default search engine on their devices
* content creators can choose to opt-out of Google crawlers to train its AI

Most obvious historical comparison is case against Microsoft Corp. in 2001; the DoJ tried to split Microsoft up due to its hold over the web browser market on Windows, though this case **ultimately resulted in a settlement**. With that in mind, it is possible, the DoJ will go this way, this time.

* Search is close to 50% revenue of Google \[Q3 results\]
* Browsers market shares: Chrome 60%, Safari 18%, Edge 8% \[Source can be contested, because it's larger devices stats only\]
* Android - 70% market share in handheld devices

GOOG has to fight hard to ensure a high search traffic. It may have a few options up its sleeves.



||||
|:-|:-|:-|
|""Chrome"" as a stand-alone listed company like Opera browser.|Possibly the worst move. Average user unlikely to install a browser-only app, than stick with factory default browser on the device. ||
|Chrome+Gemini as a new company, to command an ""AI"" valuation.|Not likely to attract advertisers, until this new 'app' gets wild Chat-GPT like popularity. ||
|Android+Chrome as a new company, provides operating system for device manufacturers|Won't make sense, because Samsung already has their prop. version of Android. And to gain search traffic, Google again needs to partner with this new company, which is prohibited.||
|A company with ""personal suite"" of applications, Gmail, Calendar, Docs and Chrome bundled together|Chrome then gets 100's million users from Day-1. Still, above legal prohibition remains. ||
|Settlement|Make it all go away!||

Any other speculations? With so much uncertainty, the stock will remain under pressure with downward bias, until there's clarity on the case.

But at PE 22, even if total revenue of the demerged companies, takes a hit of 30%, it's still a great value.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gywuwe/speculate_on_goog_whatd_be_the_best_countermove/,225,2024-11-24 18:49:02,"Google: Starts negotiations to sell Chrome to Alibaba. DOJ: Wait a minute…; The issue is that nobody else can buy chrome lol. Sell it to who Microsoft amazon oracle?; Both my laptop and my work computer **DID NOT** come with Chrome installed. I did it myself as I like the product, not because I had no options or it was forced.

Chrome isn't the issue.; I would buy Alphabet at the current price even without Chrome because Alphabet is showing strong growth across all sectors. 

Let’s really assume that profits would fall by 30 % with the disposal of Chrome, then the P/E ratio would increase by 60 %. Google would then still have a forward PE of <30 with growth of 15%. And a possible spin-off would not be an expropriation, but would happen in return for massive financial compensation for Alphabet or result in shares in the new holding company for current shareholders. And I know that Chrome is part of the Google ecosystem. But as long as Google exists, a separate mobile browser is not essential.

But thats just speculating about what happens in the absolute worst case scenario if Chrome is split off. 

Much more realistic to me is that the scope of what the Biden DOJ is currently calling for will be massively reduced once Trump takes office in January. Firstly, he has said that he would find it „unfair“ to split up Google, secondly, it does not fit in with his „America First“ doctrine to destroy one of the 10 or so companies that keep the USA globally relevant and thirdly, Matt Gaetz will not even become Attorney General in the Trump cabinet. He would certainly have been the most dangerous for Big Tech of the possible candidates.; DOJ asked Google and Google said fuck off lol. This stock is so undervalued. You won’t see these prices in a year when it’s running 250+; Bribe Trump, that’s literally all it would take for it to go away.; Valuation is pretty low for a tech company which leads me to believe the market has already priced this in.; Google is the least evil of them. They provide incredible products, and all I have to do is use adblockers and I never see an ad on anything. A split up would be a pain. I would definitely try to get my Chrome data erased.
Metas products are garbage, and microsoft will never know how make a nice product.; I honestly don't think selling Chrome makes any sense in this case. The judge ruled they acted anticompetitively by paying to be the default browser on safari and Firefox. 

Selling off Chrome makes no sense for that. I think the DOJ are just trying to cut google no matter what. Doesn't matter what google did or what makes sense. They just have an agenda.; Is there even a way to make money if Chrome is the only product in a spinoff company? Isnt the whole idea to steer users to Google search?; It's literally just noise.... Moronic headlines from journalists have no idea wtf they are talking about having you thinking Google is collapsing next week. It would be years before anything actually materializes.

Google can and will appeal. Instead of forcing Google to sell an asset in a transaction that would net Google $20B from the deal, the Supreme Court would rather take a fat multi-billion dollar settlement with $20B in their favor. And the world will keep spinning.  

In the meantime, I'll keep buying at a discount.; It’s a rare opportunity to own Google shares now as it is the cheapest of Mag 7 now, probably undervalued way too much. 

Even if DOJ is successful, breaking up Google will only bring in more value for investors. You might get shares for Chrome or cash for the spin off.; I am buying the fuck out of Google this week.  This is so fucking stupid on the DOJ's part it's unbelievable.  Also spez needs to sell Reddit to somebody stat.; Anybody who can afford to buy Chrome will get sued for antitrust.; What I have against this is that slicing away at Google's dominance doesn't help consumers. Monopoly of groceries or banks, or other things that matter, sure. But Google puts out great products without harm to consumers. This is literally just a hit job because they're too good at doing business. My data is going to be collected anyway regardless of who's running the show. I'd rather trust Google over the other Giants.; I think this makes Alphabet even more of a buy. If they abandon the action the shares will pop. If they force a sale, you’ll get shares in the spin off. Win win.; I am loading GOOG shares on the hope they break it all up and unlock real value.; just go long; I dont get how they can separate chrome.  That's literally going to kill chrome therefore just hurt google; I don’t even like chrome it’s too bloated. Still use google for search engine everything else is straight up ass; [deleted]; It's going to go away in January.  Everything about this set such a wide precedent that it could equally apply to Apple, Microsoft and Meta.  So unlikely anything will really happen.  A slap on the wrist fine and move on.; Trump and MAGA view Google is biases against MAGA, so DOJ will pursue an antitust case against it.

Chrome, is a big part of googles ad tech because it collects personalize info on who you are and can target you with ads.

Fun fact. Your online presence can be uniquely be identified by your chrome version, extension and extension build versions. No need for cookies.

If google adwords had to pay market rates for that data, their margins would be alot lower.

Thats why they pay apple 20B per year to be default.  They make more than that off chrome.; im praying it's at the current price or lower by the first of January so I can load up my Roth.; With the incoming administration there is a lot of uncertainty about the willingness for the DOJ to see this case through to its conclusion.  Microsoft was on the verge of being broken up until Gore lost in 2000.; Nothing is going to happen. This may be taken up again in 4 years though likely no.; Couldn't they just sell chrome and then develop shrome? I mean they surely know how it works...; Follow zuck, or understand what they're saying.  Either way - they should or at least could be broken up and be under an umbrella corporation.  Which is what they are, but aren't.  New CEOs just don't know anything from the 80's.  So they're lost and running around and doing what they think or thought, rather then listening and discussing.  And the DoJ isn't very good at communicating this today and lots of folks, like zuck, aren't necessarily business admin degree holders, but rather just programmers with a great idea and marketing, and their buying up everything.; If it is spun off as its own company would holders of Google stock be given shares in the new company? 

I have stock in BHP that did a spinoff and was given shares in Woodside Energy Group; I think everyone seems to be forgetting that the Trump administration is going to be running the DOJ and they are not going to force this split….; Valuation is pretty low for a tech company; This is just gonna go the same way microsoft did. Start with something unreasonably that they know wont ever come to fruition, have it shot down, find a slap on wrist compromise and proclaim victory.; Like stated already - who will buy the browser? This is conjunction with that there's a new government about to roll in makes me doubt that the split will actually happen.; There is only one resolution that even makes any sense.

If the DOJ truly feels Google is a monopoly then you require every device when first turned on to have a list of search engines that you choose from.

In random order.  It would be on Android and iPhones and PCs and Macs, etc.; All these speculations are interesting, but none of this makes me think googl isn’t worth holding.; To buy more of it.; My first though: ""Elon 'll be offered to buy chrome to get closer to his super app ambitions for X."" Weirdly that sounds at least somewhat reasonable these days... after January 20th, who knows?; DOJ can fuck themselves. Google made search.; The DoJ can fuck off on this one. The ruling will  get overruled; I'm sure Mozilla is waiting in the wing for Chromium Firefox release.; Well, google will appeal it, if the incoming administration choses to fight, things will be tied up for years, eventually there will be a meaningless settlement, lawyers get rich, we all get screwed again. 

  
Selling off chrome isn't going to do jack shit for the bottom line because it is advertising dollars they are going to get, and unless someone buys chrome and removes all the tracking shit and adblock blockers out of it, it will be irrelevant. Their marketshare has peaked. 

If the DOJ really wanted to remove the market stranglehold google has, they would have gone after exclusive agreements, and the integration for ad tracking across all their products.; Spin off Chrome into a new company, wait 5 years, announce Google Titanium.; Spin of chrome, chrome buys what's left of Google, change name to Google; DOJ needs to shutdown; pownt; I think Sundar and Trump will make a deal. They will just say something super nice about Trump, maybe boost his searches say he got the most searches of any president in history or some sh*t and the whole mess will go away.; Best move is probs just to long googl; It’s a case of big government ideologues gone haywire. Left-wing lawyers trying to make a name for themselves using taxpayer dollars.

First thing Google should do is make their case to Trump, who has common sense on these issues. If they fail at that, then they need to fight this all the way to the Supreme Court.; Google better act fast before the new admin, coz Trump and Elonia are not big fans of Google.; Spin off chrome as a separate company.

Or DoJ will become a clusterfuck in January, so Google might not have to do anything.; It’s not a monopoly. It’s too easy to download another browser that doesn’t involve googles tracking. Sure, they control a lot of what’s under the hood for other browsers, but even then.; Get a new CEO that knows how to effectively interact with the hostile DoJ/EUC.; [deleted]; Remove those censorship and woke, upcoming administration may give them a chance; I'm sure doj will do something right after Trump gets to prison.; boat follow cause political flag ancient soft gaze elderly rain

 *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*; Stop talking about. 


Let googl tank. Googl to 100.; Chrome will be bought by either oracle or adobe.; I last checked. Google majority donated to Democrats. It had bias searches to Harris; Honestly, fuck Google. They haven't come out with anything good or useful in a long time. Their AI search sucks and all their ""hey Google"" products are terrible. Even their nest products are mid. For such a giant company it's a joke. They're like 10yrs behind the times.; I posted about this last week, but I think OPRA is a good play to hedge against it. Theres a possibility that some of these smaller browsers could see an increase in their browser market share. I think OPRA fits that bill; Shite🤣🤣; That sums it up. 

Google's response to DOJ had the word 'national security' a few times.; It would probably hurt their reputation, but this would actually be hilarious. 

They should totally tell the court that is what they would do, haha; Whoopie! Another big trillion dollar tech company controlling the worlds largest web browser vs the other big trillion dollar company. Thank you DOJ!; I thought they wanted Google to split from chrome, not sell it.

As in: chrome becomes an independent company.; OpenAI could buy Chrome for more data and to put ChatGPT on every device that is running Chrome.; Yeah, I can't think of a company that can buy Chrome that wouldn't have similar monopoly issues. Plus, Chromium is open source, so it wouldn't be that difficult for Google to simply start a new browser unless the ruling forbids them from doing so.

So I'm not sure how selling Chrome is realistic or helpful when it comes to stopping monopolies. Similarly, while forbidding Alphabet from paying to make Google the default search engine on other platforms makes sense on paper, the result might be to kill or at very least severely hinder Chrome's only major non-Chromium competitor because Firefox heavily relies on those payments from Google.

Allowing users to opt-out of AI training and prohibiting Google from acquiring rival companies seems like good moves though, if the objective is to at least contain Google's dominance. I could see those happening.

Ultimately, I'm wondering how much Google's search business will end up impacted by the rise of ChatGPT, especially with OpenAI also dipping directly into search. I know Google has Gemini, but ChatGPT still appears to have the edge in consumers' minds. Keeping Microsoft as the comparison, I could see us entering an era post-Microsoft DOJ where Microsoft escaped intact, but it found itself in a diminished position anyway because while it continued to dominate the PC-business in terms of OS, it mattered less as people shifted increasingly to phones and Microsoft gradually found itself as an also-ran in that space. Of course, Microsoft eventually emerged from that stronger than ever, but there was a long period of Microsoft looking like a shell of its former self. 

Google might go through a similar period as a result of AI, especially because, like Microsoft at that time, consumer perception of Google is extremely low. That doesn't always matter because we've seen time and again that consumers will put up with a company they don't like if they're used to using their products, but it also makes them more willing to jump to a competitor if said competitor offers something that seems just as good or better, and the transition won't inconvenience the consumer. A negative feeling towards a company also makes consumers less willing to expand the number of products from that company they're using, which will perhaps work against Google as they try to compete in the AI space.

Of course, Google has mountains of money and resources, so writing them off is risky.; Couldn't they just be split off into a stand alone company? Why does anyone need to buy it persay.; Microsoft never has a monopoly /s; This isn’t an issues, spinoff; No single entity needs to buy it, they can spin it off as a new public company which the public/institutional investors own; China would want to buy Chrome even if it costed $100B

Heck I bet China would pay $3T to buy Google.

Imagine the influence and worldwide control with China as the puppet master.; Costco; Private equity would buy; It will be sold to X because corruption; they will give it to elon musk, I think the new admiration will be too much buddy system; Spin it off into a separate company, no?; Easy solution:

Force a sell and don't allow other monopolistic companies to buy it

Then Google will have to sell for a massive valuation loss and this will incentivize against Monopolies

But they won't do this; [deleted]; And their moonshot bets are very promising. Alphabet is already running self driving cars, transporting passengers and generating revenue in multiple cities.

If Tesla had achieved even a fraction of this, the stock would be up 50%; G has a very low P/E when compared to emerging tech market companies in quantum computing, self-driving, AI infrastructure, and AI chat. If you look at the private equity valuations on openAI, Cerebras, they all have far higher P/E than G.; There is alot of AI companies positioning for search.  Ie perplexity, openAi, bing, Xai.

Their dominance is waning.; I've been holding google since around 2014 and I don't think it comes anywhere close to 250, but I wouldn't mind if it did.; Google has fallen behind. AI has greatly devalued search, and losing chrome means losing sear h on mobile. 80% of their revenue is search. They missed the boat on cloud and missed the boat on AI. I do not understand why people on reddit think this is a good move. Personally I see Google becoming another IBM or Intel. A tech has-been.; Yeah seriously I bet this gets reversed within a month of Trump taking office just like all his felony charges.; Dont even have to bribe, just wait a few months and this will fizzle out when Trump steps into the office; Question since I'm out of the loop: Wasn't google the #1 corporate donor for Harris? Wouldn't that damage googles position when negotiating with the Trump administration? 

Genuinely asking.; Yeah about the as blocker thing.. They're gonna kill that; Dude, Google is pretty shady—they’re literally combing through all your data, from emails to photos to your Drive to maps to your search history. I’m not saying anyone else is much better, but they’re definitely not the least shady; they’re just as bad as the rest.

Edit: just to be clear, I am **not** in favor of Google being broken up. As a consumer I like the convenience of how well their products work together. I am just pointing out they are just as shady as their competition.; Their leadership is inept when figuring out how to deal with the DoJ/EUC compared to for example Microsoft.; Pushing Google to sell chrome is likely just a bargaining chip. I'd wager that they will settle for google agreeing to not pay to be the default on other platforms (apple mostly).; Seems more like an easy way to implement punishment on google at least from the DoJ's perspective.; People still default to google search in safari, Firefox, edge, etc.. search might be impacted, but it won’t be significant. It’s a red herring. 

The relevant point for losing chrome is the impact to all the user data. The browser collects an enormous amount of user data that google then uses to place highly targeted ads. The browser knows everything you do on the internet, and the data it’s siphoning off feeds the google ad revenue machine. Without this data google will now either have to acquire it or be faced with lower converting (lower priced) ad space.; Not if a company isn't allowed to pay to be the default search on Chrome.; Chrome is part of Google proper, not a spinoff or ""bet"" in Alpha-bet lingo.; why would he sell Reddit? Google is paying a fuck ton of money to scrape Reddit's data and all of our amazing posts.; The issue is anti-competition, not greatness of products or privacy concerns. It's pretty much **impossible** to compete with Google today, for any other ad-platform. 


Publishers like NYTimes, too are unhappy bcoz Google bot can just scrape their content and show you a 3 line summary in search or Gemini, circumventing a potential traffic on their pages.


The old model of ""running a content website and making money from ads"" of 90s is basically shattered today ; Agreed, but many will not agree with your last sentence.; hmmm..OK; This is my first thought too haha. Just wait three months and then grease Trump's palm. Lawsuit goes away.; Trump, Elon, and Sundar have had several phone calls together

You don't need to know someone's browser version to know their web activity. You could simply use their public IP address. It's also not a problem unique to Chrome

Trump doesn't want to punish Google, he want to use it to his advantage.; I actually don't think the worry here is what's going to be decided in the summer next year with Google and Meta in fact (although they have no cases at least as far as I know right now).

I'd say the concern would be that they get heavily pursued for censorship actually due to the events that transpired out of early 2021 for revenge.; I see social media regulation coming down the pipeline but this is antitrust lawsuit is bullshit.; I disagree on why they pay Apple.  I think they could easily NOT pay Apple and everything would be the same.    This actually happened in the EU already and no one switched engines really. In 2021 

I think they pay apple now because it’s the status quo, and Apple relies on that money.  Cutting it would be a literal act of war.  

This is geopolitics

It would be great if the DOJ cuts that payment tho and makes Apple prompt user for default.  That would be insanely bullish IMO; Yes, we know Trump is in power.; Agreed.; lol; Yes, it would almost certainly happen that way. Look at the ""baby bell"" stocks.; Somewhat agree.; Interesting theory, very easy to see it happening that way.; They did something similar in the EU, most still choose Google search.; >googl is worth holding

but at what price? Chrome (60% users share) is sending tonnes of search traffic to Google search - which is company's 50% revenue. A spin-off is a big hit on Google's bread n butter.; Lol mozilla is clutching their pearls at the thought of losing most of their revenue as soon as any ruling is officially made.; It surprises me that the vast majority of people don't seem to understand that Google can appeal and think that corrective action will be taken against Google tomorrow.; Not sure why so many people think this rofl

You do realize there would not be any LLMs without Google?

They are who have made the huge innovations to make possible.  Not just Attention is all you need but so many other fundmental AI breakthroughs have come from Google.

If you look at the last 10 years and papers accepted at the canonical AI research organization, NeurIPS, Google has led every single year in papers accepted.

The last one Google had twice the papers accepted as next best.   Most of the last 10 years Google was #1 and #2 as they use to breakout DeepMind from Google Brain.

Google makes the HUGE breakthrough, patents it, then shares in a paper.  But then what is so unusual about Google is the fact they then let anyone use for completely free.    I think this fact is why you probably do not know how much of the most important innovations from the last 20 years have come from Google.

Not just AI. But in so many other areas.; Average person isn't gonna actively install Opera browser. What would very likely happen is, Chrome users getting a T&C pop-up to click away, informing them of new ownership, re-confirming their choice of search engine.


Yes, the seamless data collection and personalization will stop (or be difficult), but Chrome's market share won't come down by much.


If this sets a precedence, Apple and MSFT too will think twice before bundling their browsers in their ecosystem.; I wonder what happens to the selling of Chromebook? Lol are they still in the market; > Google's response... had the word 'national security' a few times.

I guess that's a threat.

Google saying:

*""Thanks to all our spyware, we've got so much dirt on your government you wouldn't dare to do anything.""*; lol we took down that evil google to protect poor Amazon!; Yes, that’s what DOJ wants. After a new owner is found for chrome, then DOJ can rinse and repeat the lawsuit against the new owner because after breaking up Google, chrome is still the largest in search market. Period; I hope the Mozilla Foundation buys it.

:); And is the government going to fund chrome ? What happens to chrome if Google doesn't sink a dime into it.; But does Chrome make money on its own?; i understood that also; Buy Chrome with whose money?; How would this fix anything? Then Microsoft gets all the Chrome data instead of Google? 

That’s like Meta being forced to sell their Facebook marketplace to Amazon. “Oh hooray” says the consumer.; The difference is that in the 90s, Microsoft was actively fucking every consumer and business in existence. Google is virtually the only big tech company that has maintained their forever-free model.; Not only they've to divest, Google cannot enter browser market for 5 years.; No monopoly? Look at Office Productivity. Windows, Teams, Office, Linkedin, Github, Copilot and Azure DB, etc.; Chrome wouldn't survive without Google; Start charging tariffs on searches lol; Put yourself in their shoes and imagine if the government forced you to sell your business because you're too good. Doesn't sound very republic to me.; The fuck? No shit a Chrome Book is going to come with Chrome. Would you expect a Chrome book to have safari or Edge or Netscape Navigator or some shit?

This is completely different than having an OS. You install windows and it doesn't come with Chrome, you have to seek it out and download it.; Did you seriously put Bing and Xai in that list?; Thats the talking point for 2 years now, yet, nothing happened. Google holds strong on to its market share and the last quarter showed record revenue for Search.; Prove it; You've been holding GOOG for a decade over which it grew 500%, and you don't think GOOG will grow an additional 50% over its future?

I call bullshit or you're stupid or both.; You do realise that the tech boom is aligned with apple hitting 1T and Nvidia going 200% a year? Basically the AI boom++; They had the most impressive Q3 earnings compared to Microsoft and Meta; Lost the boat on cloud? You must be living under a rock; You do not live in reality. You live in reddit and social media. Your average person you meet on the street still do not fully understand how AI works. They might have heard of ChatGPT but they do not use it. There is a current fearing trend of AI as well, especially with bots taking over places like twitter and a hit towards AI by government security is a very good possibility as we go in to the future.

People like you are the reason I am up 60% on Alphabet when fear of google losing to AI was at its highest. So honestly, please continue.; He already said Khan is gone. 

The more interesting thing is the sheer volume of shills in the past week pushing for the divestment of chrome and hammering down of android. It makes you wonder who would benefit from these moves.; Exactly, was scrolling to find these comments. I think he's recently praised google too. New Prez/DOJ makes me think this will go away. I'm not much of a single stock guy, but have some Google I bought many years ago. Not selling.

I do think the biggest thing that could threaten Google is Apple or whoever replacing Google as the default search engine on iPhones and one that average people use. If Apple eventually comes up with their own and it's actually really good via Chat GPT or something, that could be a big deal for their ad business, especially if Google was ever forced to offload Chrome. But overall a great business growing well with Cloud, YouTube, Ads etc etc; They've been saying this for what 5+  years? and ublock origin still works fine on Chrome.; already have. Try watching YouTube with AdBlocker. Doesn't work.; You can easily, easily route all popular ad server DNS records through your local host file.

That is untouchable by anyone but you.; They are super shady. But in exchange, all their products work reasonably-to-incredibly well *and* integrate with each other seamlessly *and* i get to pay with data instead of cash.; Noone needs to use any Google services. Use maps or another naviation system and there are a multitude of other email/search providers to choose from.; 
It would make no sense if they just allowed other search engines to pay for defaults but not Google cuz they’re too successful 

I feel like if it comes to that they would just prevent Apple from selling the default at all; What do you mean?; Yeah, I was more wondering how a separate Chrome company would make money without the search ads. Selling that data (maybe back to Google), I guess?; So is OpenAI tho; > Publishers like NYTimes, too are unhappy bcoz Google bot can just scrape their content and show you a 3 line summary in search or Gemini, circumventing a potential traffic on their pages.

Then they are really going to love ChatGPT! A short summation of an article is not the same as the whole thing, plus so many are going behind paywalls or soft paywalls anyway.; >You don't need to know someone's browser version to know their web activity. You could simply use their public IP address

That's not how this works. Public IPs of home Internet connections are a) typically shared among many households and b) not static. Not to speak of hundreds of users sharing an internet connection at work, college or Starbucks.

That's exactly the reason why companies come up with advanced techniques like browser finger printing. That's not science fiction.

>It's also not a problem unique to Chrome

That on the other hand is correct. What's unique to them is that they have by far the biggest market share.; So you think that the people running Google are just a bunch of dumba**es that have been paying Apple 20 billion dollars a year for nothing?; Yes. But Google wouldn’t just be giving Chrome away. There would be cash/stock value returning to the parent. And that assumes the DOJ could force a divestiture. I might be more worried, at the moment, about EU regulators.; It won't happen that way, you can trust me on that.; Have to subscribe to read about the call between the 3 of them. 

I kinda heard that Trump isn't a big fan of google because of alleged ""biases"" that google search results have against him. 

And Elon... Well his xAI will compete with Google's Gemini. His Tesla robotaxis will compete with Waymo. He had put money into openAI in the first place because of his fear of google putting together AI and keeping it for himself. 

Hard to say where this will fall...; Because they always complain about Google search ""censorship of conservatives""?; *I hope.*; He just walks in like whazup, that would be hilarious 😂; I have a feeling their legal team is not the best that money can buy, or that it is unsatisfactory.

I love my chromebook and I would be so pissed if I couldn't get another one.; And now you need to have Prime to use Chrome!

Or you can spend hours looking for relevant search results on Bing!; Normally the parent company gets shares in the spinoff, hence has a vested interest to see it succeed.; As I understand it, Chrome doesn't make any money but it does generate revenue for Google. Since Google is the default search in Chrome, that increases the number of people using Google search, which means more ad revenue for Google. 

Also Chrome collects data so Google can make targeted ads. 

If Chrome splits and becomes its own company, I don't know how it can generate income on its own. I suppose Google would have to pay Chrome for data and for it to be the default search engine on Chrome. I'm not sure if the DOJ ruling would allow for this.; Yes; Ad revenue; [deleted]; Bingo.; Maybe, they could also establish a partnership with Google and run as separate companies like Pepsi did with yum brands; Well monopolies aren't republic either 

If law makers did their job in the first place the top monopolies would have been broken up already; Bing - the first chat gpt wrapper XD; Wasn’t it literally 2k+ before the stock split; Yeah, well they still own chrome and thus still have a monopoly on search.; This is one of the largest companies in the world. Their competitors of the same tier continually find ways to take market leadership. Google is repeatedly a follower in everything except search.; I have no idea what point you're trying to make, other than just being rude and condescending. Enjoy your 60% on your 100 dollar investment, no amount of money can give someone class.; Apple.; > If Apple eventually comes up with their own and it's actually really good via Chat GPT or something, that could be a big deal for their ad business

Given this ruling, there is a 0% chance that Apple would be allowed to even come up with a search engine and make it default. The DOJ is proposing to force Google to stop making Google the default search in the Chrome browser on Android for fuck's sake. 

The only actual solution here is to have no defaults and present a screen where the user can choose their own on all platforms.; It work perfectly for me with u block.; But with google you know it's well implemented usually. All their products have a high level of quality and polish that you might not see with some other companies.

Like google drive being connected to google docs, gmail, etc. Using a different account and company for everything is pretty annoying; That’s how antitrust works. Something can be fine for one party to do but another party might not be able to do it; Them and everyone else in the ad serving space; I am a software engineer with a CCNP. Believe me, I know how it works. Judging by your inaccurate generalizations, you clearly do not.

Your public IP address is dynamically assigned by your ISP from a block of IP addresses they own.

Your modem gets a unique IP address--modems cannot share a single IP address that would create an IP conflict. That's basic TCP/IP networking 101.

Your IP address may be dynamic, but it is certainly not anonymous. You may get x.x.x.12 today and x.x.x.182 tomorrow, but the MAC address of your modem is registered with your ISP. Otherwise, they wouldn’t extend you an IP lease.

You’re describing Source Network Address Translation (SNAT). Packets are forwarded to your public IP, and then your edge router routes traffic to private IPs on your LAN. In this case, yes, clients behind the NAT have a sort of anonymity unless someone has access to your MAC tables.

There is no browser ""fingerprint."" It's a combination of browser build, device OS build, that is unique. You can also very easily spoof your browser agent.

Even if a nefarious actor knew the unique parameters of your HTTP requests, they would still have to prove that that unique combination was a stack a specific individual used.

Learn more about TCP/IP networking if you're so concerned about people knowing about your obviously embarrassing Internet traffic.; I expressed my view on this very clearly. Can you demonstrate that you actually understand my comment?; Agreed, but you have a lot of history and reading to do about the relationship between Google people, Trump, and Musk.

If it’s true: Then AAPL and INTC goes up

Apple Silicon is one of the best on the market.; So the future Apple products will have horrible overheating issues again?; Fakest news I've read in a while. Congrats. Also reported for misinformation. Enjoy your ban.; Already priced in; Apple should just buy Intel.; Why? Apple Silicon is literally leaving other chips in the dirt. Doubt they will pivot away from that after it’s been so successful; Intel’s 18A process was developed way before the whole AI boom, so it wasn’t really meant to produce large dies with high yields like what’s needed for GPUs or future phone SoCs. Best case scenario, Intel might pull off chiplets to compete with AMD in the server market just to survive, and maybe they’ll figure out how to improve yields on larger dies to take on TSMC. But honestly, I don’t think they’ll last that long.; Not happening. At least not without big warning signs that things will be changing. 

Apple has spent the last 4 years talking about how much faster Apple Silicon is compared to Intel. It’s a big part of their marketing strategy. 

Even though this would still be “Apple Silicon”, they wouldn’t risk customers getting confused and thinking M4 is superior to (what would be) M5 if M5 is fabricated by intel. 

So, if this happens, you’re going to see them walk back a lot of their marketing and possibly release a couple minor products using intel fabrication before they ever release an IPhone or MacBook SOC in partnership with intel; intels chips are frying servers left and right. i recently read 100% failure rate. no one is taking a chance with that trash; Apples buying Intel confirmed.; Intel lost to AMD , just a matter of time before AMD scoops up every bit of life left in it; im so tempted to put down 100k in leap calls; This article is about phones not MacBooks; Source : trust me bro; Classic apple, acting independent And in their own world and still, they 99% relying on third-party manufacturers in every product.

Trumpet is gonna fuck all competition with his tarrif dumb-fuckery. Then do what Intel always does and sits on their ass. Eventually someone will fix the dumb-fuckery and intel will stare at us like they don’t understand what happened.

Just in the event they have to switch for reasons out of their control, like China taking over Taiwan.; All the top tech companies using TSMC should be paying billions to Taiwan to buy arms from US.; This would be top comment…in perfect world; nice critical thinking; China invading Taiwan means everyone will have much larger fish to fry then worrying about Intel stock price.; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259)

They are not using Intel chips.  They may be using Intel’s 2nm manufacturing process to build Apple chips.  Gotta read the words in the article.; 2027; Well, yeah. That’s the whole point of a foundry.

We build the process, and you design the chip.; Apple has used Intel chips in the past it's not too crazy to think they would do it again.; Bullish, Apple will get better yields than Intel would have; Oh so Tim cook now analysing geopolitics tensions instead of improving his phones sales. Cool.; sir, are you gonna play or else you need to get up from the seat; Everyone floods in only to realize they need to wait 2 years for anything to happen, floods right back out; Apple is going to buy Intel, 2026; Apple doesn’t have a foundry. They’re not manufacturing their own chips anytime soon. Apple operates on about a 15 year cadence of silicon family design, fast forward 10 years maybe they’ll be bringing silicon manufacturing in-house but there’s no sugar coating the fact it’ll cost tens of billions before even shipping a product, and we’ll hear about it probably 10 years before it’s in a product they ship. 

If Apple were to put Apple-manufactured apple silicon into the (for example) A25 chip in the 2032 iPhone 23, and the M12 CPU we’d be hearing rumours of them constructing fabs *now*; It was always AAPL; Apple couldn't manufacture the physical chips themselves even if they wanted to, so that scenario is void.; > If it’s not true and Apple produce the chips themselves

Apple ain’t gonna be going back to x86 ever. lol.; The article doesn't mention using intel chips but that Apple may use intel's process. Anyway it's a bunch of ""may"" and speculation.; So horribly wrong. Apple was getting absolutely crushed in performance at end of PPC era. Switching to Intel brought them up to par and also let them run Windows native and as VM, making it so much easier to switch.; All 10 generations of it right? Lmao ur a goof.; Idk why you’re getting downvoted, they were horrible.; Intel chips were terrible for laptops back then, but they got away with it because nobody wanted to innovate enough. Sure, Intel chips performed better in other laptops due to heat management. But it cost battery life, performance per watt, and overall performance. Intel was also stagnant, with improvements being so minuscule year over year. 

So Apple poured money into R&D for the M series chips. These chips were so much better that they forced Intel to actually try for the first time in ages. The new Intel SOCs are unlike the old Intel CPUs. While I still think M3 and M4 have the edge for most applications, it’s not as it used to be. I switched from Windows to an M1 MacBook because the competition was laughable. For the small cost of learning MacOS, which I now prefer, I got a CPU that matched some desktop CPUs and outperformed any comparable laptop chip.

It was easily the best chip on the market for a laptop. 

But that’s not true anymore. Apple’s laptop SOC adoption pushed the industry further. Before Intel’s first laptop SOC, I couldn’t recommend anyone buy a new Windows laptop for any reason. The terrible power efficiency, lack of NPU, weak integrated graphics, etc., meant you were buying a laptop that was almost obsolete on arrival.

Intel released its first Core series SOCs, and even though they were inferior to the M2 and M3, they were now ‘good enough’ for most purposes. You could tell someone, “if you really want Windows, that’s fine, just get the new Core series and not the i5/i7/i9s.”

Now with their second-generation Core series, they’re real competitors again. It’s a bit of a toss-up between 2nd Gen Core processors and the M3. There are many comparably priced versions between the two, and they were neck and neck for most things, with M3 slightly edging out battery performance and Intel sometimes squeezing out more processing power depending on the task.

The M4 extends Apple’s lead once again, but by a smaller margin than it used to be, and Intel is likely only one or two generations away from having an SOC that matches Apple Silicon blow for blow at this rate.

So yeah, don’t be surprised if this does happen eventually. It’s conceivable that very soon, Apple will want to partner with Intel to co-create Apple Silicon, using the best of both Intel’s design and Apple’s. Intel’s CEO has explicitly said that winning back Apple’s business is a high priority for him. He *wants* Apple to let Intel help with their MacBooks. He’s not competing with MacBooks; he’s trying to prove that Intel is now up to the task of powering them.; The conjunction “if” is the most important word here.; Apple doesn't make silicon, bruh. Not sure if you knew this but they design it and have it fabbed out. Note that this means they could have the same design fabbed by someone else.; Their designs are good but they dont have their own factories. Right now they use TSMC's factories but they're considering switching to Intel's factories; Check the domain lmao; Apple can only design chips. They can't manufacture them.; This would be intel making Apple Silicon, the way TSMC does today.; could mean they use them for 5g or wifi chips and not SoCs; *This “pivot.” Is it in the room with us now?*

Intel 4 is their upcoming 7nm process. Meanwhile AMD is already on TSMC's 5nm node process with the 7000 series and that was back in 2022.

You sure about that? Maybe if Kamala (or Nikki Haley) won. Everything with Trump is a grift or a hustle. Foreign governments openly bribed him throughout the entirety of the first administration. There is definitely a price China could pay him or his family to let them invade the same way the Saudis gave Kushner $2 bil for nuclear secrets. 

> Too much of the economy and national security is dependent on being able to source tech from Taiwan.

Yea, which is why Biden got the CHIPS Act passed to have a subsidized fab built in Arizona. Our economy and natsec is now more secure from disruption by a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. [Mike Johnson already said before the election they want to get rid of CHIPS](https://apnews.com/article/mike-johnson-chips-act-d5504f76d3aa0d5b401216f3592c9a09) and Trump has also attacked it. If they repeal it, the tax breaks are gone and the fab will have to close and leave us vulnerable. 

The only party that would benefit from the fab being gone in the event of an invasion is China. The agreement to enrich Trump in exchange for letting Taiwan get invaded and boosting China’s  economy may already be in place.; That's makes more sense than war logic.; TSMC is manufacturing chips for Intel to allow Intel to focus on 18A rather then ramping up a process that's behind - Intel is playing leap frog to get back in the game. 18A=1.8nm.; Yeah, let's stop pretending like if China went to war with Taiwan like intel will save the chip market.

Samsung's yields lately have been abysmal for the most advanced node, and they haven't even jumped on the High-NA bandwagon yet, Intel is the first mover there.  So you're down to two.

199,Google stock thoughts ," think that google depends on Apple , if apple products fail, or if apple partner with another search engine then Google would fail

Edge and Bing are really good now , comes installed in 80% of the machines sold , if its good enough why bother downloading chrome ? and Bing looks almost exactly the same as google , 

Chrome Os is failing also, Android might get antitrust..  



What do you think? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gy9591/google_stock_thoughts/,0,2024-11-23 21:34:18,"Terrible thread; Ask ten random people if they use bing? Or ever heard of it? Edge?; Don't really agree with this. 

If google was not the default search engine for other browsers people would change it to google. It's a verb for a reason even now. Tiny portion of people will pick duckduckgo or even Bing. 

Chrome has about 66.6% of the market. Even if Edge is installed on 80% of machines, guess what people search for on Edge? Chrome installation. And they search for it with Google. 

And despite the chatgpt, Search revenue is still growing, hitting 12% revenue growth in the latest quarter. Despite that, Google has been heavily investing in AI with their Gemini and AI overviews which personally are really great. 

To me the problem with google now is antitrust. DOJ wants google to sell off Chrome which would really hurt. But google is going to fight it hard. And also, personally, I don't think it makes sense since they lost the lawsuit over anticompetitive practices by paying apple $20B and other browsers to make Google the default. Had nothing to do with chrome. So it doesn't make sense to ask google to sell off chrome. 

Other lawsuit is over their ad network.; Major 2022 Meta vibes here. Sell your shares to me, thank you.; A lot of people saying Google have dropped the ball, yet their revenue keeps growing?

Okay, they maybe don't have the best AI out there but there's so much more to them than that.
If you're only looking at chrome potentially being sold off as a reason not to buy, then you're missing the point.
Google is an absolute monster, and will roar back.

Its last earnings was another beat, which they've managed to do in 4 of the last 4 quarters.
Its PE price is cheap and below it's historical average.
Its revenue keeps growing and it's EPS last earnings was very good.
They have a very very small dividend and have been purchasing small amounts of stock over the last decade.

My PT is 200 in 2025, approximately 20% upside from here.; Bing is terrible.; Google isn't failing/would not fail if Apple partnered with someone else. 

Is there a potential for Google to see some impact? Sure, and they should have diversified like they said they would with the Alphabet change in 2015. ""We're going to be the Berkshire of tech"" (https://www.marketwatch.com/story/with-alphabet-google-seeks-to-be-techs-berkshire-hathaway-2015-08-10) was basically forgotten about a year or two later and nearly a decade after that announcement the company is still largely ad revenue. Google isn't going anywhere - OP talking about Google failing? - but things could have been improved over the last decade and there will probably be a cloud (drumroll) over it for a while until people get greater clarity regarding competition and the future. If people don't get a better view of what the future looks like sooner than later, could certainly see some investors pushing for new management (and I don't think they'd be wrong in doing so.); I have been buying…my hope, which is not a strategy, is that DT will deregulate and google will stop worrying about antitrust and focus on their core businesses.; I like google.  I feel they can easily layoff huge pct of their workforce and not suffer at all.  So that means they can increase earnings no problem.  They have strong AI dept.   downside is DOJ and am not sure their management is that great.; Google is in a doward spiral from being behind in AI to having the DoJ wanting to break them apart. Unfortunately Google is my largest position but I am not adding.; personally, GOOGL is in my avoid list now.; Sell google, but not for the reasons you said.

It's a meme, but it's also true:  Bing is *phenomenal* for porn.  If you don't believe me, try it for yourself (tee hee).  

I feel like Google intentionally de-prioritizes porn searches and Bing's layout is simply much better.; He's actually might be on right track, speculating on different outcomes for Google.


Obviously, it'd be terrible for just ""Chrome"" to be a listed company like OPRA browser, no-one cares.


I'd speculate, Google would spin off Chrome+Gemini as a new company, to command an ""AI"" valuation.


Otherwise, a company with ""personal suite"" of applications, Gmail, Calendar, Docs and Chrome bundled together. So that users of one product will get Chrome by default. 


They'll do their best to retain search traffic. But even if their revenues drop 50%, the current PE of 22 becomes 44, which is still a fair valuation for a tech giant.; It's terrible thread, because a lot of blatant statements (more like personal opinions) are dished out. Market data and the recent Q3 results suggest otherwise.


Are you speaking about smartphones or larger devices? Android is 70% market share for smartphones, handheld devices.


On desktops and laptops, Edge has 8% market share, compared to Chrome 60%, followed by Safari 18%.


Personally, I use Edge because I'm on windows ecosystem, but I always switched to google.com on Edge, because Bing search is just terrible, for any meaningful fact finding. Sure, if I just want to check a recipe, it can be OK, but for serious information, I find Google ranks more credible websites first, whereas Bing seems like ""tourist information desk"" with obviously gimmicky sites.; Every company I’ve worked at uses both chrome and edge because certain sites, soft phones, etc work better on each browser; My point is as follows: ask ten random people if they use bing? Or Edge? Or ever hear of either one?; what the hell is your family up to; Have they lost market share? Or are you predicting they will? 

They're still like 90% or so.; Yeah, I really think folks are underrating the possibility that at the very minimum the S&P doesn't pull back-to-back-to-back +20% years and in the worst case, doing something not fun like oh snap, having a negative year.

I know Trump was Mr. Stock Market in his tenure, but in spite of me hating him, I do feel like he's set up poorly for a continuation of that with the S&P flirting with 6k and probably going over to end the year.

In a world where next year is hypothetically like a mish mash of 2018 and 2022 maybe, Google would very likely be a key underperformer at least until the court case is wrapped up.; Yes, let's forget about Google Play and their Cloud Revenue which is growing double digits every year atm.; And yet Microsoft isn't getting targeted by the DoJ.

[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse); Looks like we are bringing democracy to Indonesia.; indonesia is probably one of the worst places in the world to work. Most of the locals I worked with were slow or were relatives of someone.; From an investing Perspective: ""Darn you Indonesia! You philistines that don't understand capitalism.""                                                                                                                                                                   From a humanitarian perspective: ""Good on them for saying manufacture almost half the shit in the country if you want to sell them here.""; Good old racketeering must be the way when you’re a shit country; Humanitarian? It's purely political and protectionist. And it usually backfires by increasing costs.; Lol this is exactly what Trump wants to do in the US....; I’m sure the country you live in is always so moral.; Increases costs which are offset with  paying jobs for them. The opposite side of nice cheap products are losses in jobs and reliance on a foreign country for goods.; \> Increases costs which are offset with paying jobs for them.    
I am sure you feel better buying more expensive products knowing that your close neighbor or compatriot is benefiting from that. No, wait, only very few people care about that, that's why they are happy to order stuff from China.    
    
\> reliance on a foreign country for goods  
That's just pure political propaganda. iPhones are not a strategic resource, the country would be all good without them all together. You do not need to manufacture in-house every luxury product. Good luck trying to blackmail a country that you won't export to them high-end cars. You are more dependent on them buying your expensive crap that they are.    
    
My main point is that this not humanitarian. Your concern for your country employment rate is not humanitarian. You may be a patriot, sure, but not a humanitarian. Humanitarian = concern for all people, not just in your own country."
201,Thoughts on building a 10Y high risk portfolio,"Over the past few years I’ve built a portfolio consisting of S&P, Apple, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, JPM and BRK. It has done rather well, consistently giving returns of 25%+ annually (except 2022). 

However in recent times my conviction on adding more capital to this portfolio has waned. I just feel the best days in terms of returns for some of the big tech groups may not be what they were for the past decade.

I could 100% be wrong and there is no doubt there is certain bias seeing the return of my smaller positions this year dwarfing the ones of the traditional blue chip guys if you will.

So saying all this I’m considering: 

50% S&P

10% Hood

10% Rddt

10% Rolls Royce

10% Cava

5% Lunr

5% ASTS

Quick rationale for each:

Hood: Expanding to Europe and offering very exciting new products like Hood Gold 

Rddt: Fastest growing social media, ARPU and monetisation only getting better and seeing many more people using

Rolls Royce: Slight European exposure, building low cost Nuclear plants and capturing the wide body aircraft market

Cava: Fantastic management, strong customer retention and expected to double stores in next 5 years

Lunr & ASTS: Moonshot (literally), this is just in case space works out and much more speculative 



So having said all that, what is everyone’s thoughts on this proposed portfolio allocation. Is this too risky, not enough diversification into the different sectors?

If it were me I would take many high risk positions and let the winners win and the losers fade away. Probably 25+. If 1-3% of your portfolio was in stocks like Netflix, Nvidia, Monster, etc early on, you would still be rich. Hope it works out for you but that’s going to be a very volatile ride. You are going to have to have great discipline to hold through that.; Try Majority in $SPLG, $SGUV, $BRKB then add all your individuals like Mag7s AMZN, GOOGL, NVDA and your riskier stocks (3%>)LUNR, RKLB, ASTS; Microstrategy; Buying only stocks that +100%'d in the last month. No recency bias at all.; >I’ve built a portfolio consisting of S&P, Apple, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, JPM and BRK. So saying all this I’m considering: 50% S&P,10% Hood,10% Rddt,10% Rolls Royce,10% Cava,5% Lunr,5% ASTS

In short, this is called FOMO (Fear of Missing out) and greediness that kills your money.

You are supposed to reduce 50% of ""S&P, Apple, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, JPM and BRK"" and put it into TLT, but trying to do at wrong side.

Try yourslef and let us revisit after 1 year !

Remindme! 1 Year.; Lol you’ve picked mainly stocks that have pumped big time already: Hood, Rolls etc; Hood- i think the 24/5 trading will get more attention, for better or worse.

Lunr/spec- maybe less exposure.

Cava- i held that bag for a year or so, sold, then it took off. If you can get it on a pullback and they actually do double in scale over 5 years then good on you

Rolls- i think there are better plays in that space but that's just an opinion

Reddit- i think the biggest value here is data for AI. Reddit has almost 2 decades of data on about every topic you can think of. It's a lot of echo chamber and hive mind, but brilliant insight. If I had some extra money right now this is where I would put it after that Seasonal Q1 pullback; I like these picks and I’m tempted by all of them myself, but are we overly influenced by what’s shot up quite recently? Two years ago, these companies  were quite a bit cheaper and not top of mind for me. Perhaps a way to account for this selection bias is to buy half the position in these now, and half if they come down after a year or two.; Mstr; Uhhh you have Reddit and hood in there but not Palantir?; I'd just do Nasdaq, maybe defense sector without any leverages.


To avoid absurd risk, fees. 


Im too stupid to pick individual stocks, keep that in mind.; This is a good way to cut your gains in half; Cava is prob done growing like a monster, and why 50% S&P? Can just do TSLA NVDA instead and make 5x more; I think you’re wrong. The positions you have (basically mag 7) will continue to do very well especially in the next stages of the AI boom (not bubble). These companies will be the best positioned to take advantage of AI gains. However, there’s always gonna be the RKLB, the MSTR or the PLTR that will surprise us all. In the end you gotta be diversified. The next 4 years will be some of the greatest. Don’t miss out.; What will happen - at some point the next 10 years, this market will take a 1-2 year hit of 30% to 50% drawdown. That's for the indices. You are fine if you buy index stocks and DCA with a time horizon of 20-30 years. Markets tend to have 8-15 years of nice returns, then 1 decade or so of chop. See 70's - 80's, then 2000-2010.

What will happen to your high beta portfolio is you will see 80% drawdown when that happens, instead of 30-50%. All stocks go down in a crisis as people scramble for liquidity. Online forums, overpriced pita bread, brokerage correlated to bitcoin, and a luxury carmaker will all get obliterated. And since the market hates you personally, this will be right when you need the cash for a downpayment or a car. You will panic sell just like you are panic buying right now. You will give up, say, well, I should have stuck with indexes, and become an index DCA person like 90% of salaried employees. 

If your time horizon is that long, you should take advantage of high rates as a guaranteed offset until they collapse, which will only happen if there are bad economic times - which is coincidentally the time to buy more indexes. 

Time horizon being long isn't a logical reason to take more risk immediately. That'snot how compounding works.; Misunderstood the comment, thought you meant all in on rocket lab lmao😭; It was between lunr and rklb, honestly could have been either; Exactly I don't mind taking this risk as I have a long time horizon and accept some of these will potentially not work out in 10 years time.; I mean sure if only I had the liquidity to make 25+ high risk bets with any meaningful amounts. What is it that you hate about these picks?; I don't fully understand your comment, what did you mean by trying to do at wrong side?

|-|-|-|-|; I really appreciate someone finally commenting on the individual positions!

Hood thesis is they're getting lot of deposits with their upto 3% boost which will be reflected in greater trading volume. They've expanded into UK and already doing well imagine rest of Europe.

Cava I already own 30 shares but won't touch it at current levels. Like you said waiting for a pullback or maybe DCAing over coming quarters.

What is it you don't like about RR. For me their SMR play has yet to truly begin and they're one of the few players that have actual experience in small sized reactors. Plus their current defence and aerospace business isn't going anywhere. 

Reddit is leveraging AI incredibly well. Their targeting is getting better and I think their biggest boost is not just from LLM monetisation but having Google promote them on their front page. What's a price point you'd be comfortable getting back into reddit as I keep waiting for it to fall below 100 but doesn't seem like it's happening anytime soon.; There's definitely an argument to be made about recency bias. But then again which half decent hasn't shot up quite a bit recently? I'm struggling to find value at these price points.

Own a few shares in each and will continue buying on a monthly basis to keep my cost basis from exploding with a big lump sum investment.; This guy gets it. Bravo; I honestly don't get what they're selling precisely and find their opaquness too uncomfortable. Additionally their yearly growth is below 30% for last two years which doesn't imply strong future growth to justify their stock rise.; I have 50%	 allocated into indexes and also want to build an individual stock portfolio. Since I enjoy conducting thesis and then putting money behind my convictions which so far has worked well. 

However ofc in a bull run practically everything just goes up and seems to work well..; Because I'd prefer to have index exposure in case my individual stocks start underperforming and lower overall risk.

Why do you believe Cava growth story is over? Just achieved profitability and expecting to open 50 or so stores annually.; I’m up on rocket lab and I considered diversifying but my thoughts are that rocketlab feels more tangible.; Google is now a great ""high risk"" holding 🤣  Also, look at BABA ; Do not you feel SPX/NDX are at ATH. You got all excellent stocks jumped this much by indexes ATH.; Here's my .02. RR- there are other movers in this space who have more resources dedicated to SMR. If you want a name with some exposure,  I understand RR. If you want a SMR play, there are better names. IMO

 Reddit- ya honestly I don't have a number in my head. I don't think Wallstreet still has a solid grasp on how to value this company. It's going higher. If AI is what we hope it is, it's going much higher. I don't have spare cash to throw at it rn or I would. For now, I wait to see if seasonality or a non name specific event happens and I can get a 10%+ drop over a week or so; I understand but the title said high risk - and for cava the PE is already absurd; By more tangible do you mean making much greater revenues already and being further ahead in their monetisation or is it more product related?; A dumb question: why invest in BABA when you could invest in the leveraged etfs?; Yes both indexes are basically at their ATH. But if I only invested when SPX dipped I would have missed out on some great gains. Plus I firmly believe time in market > timing the market.; Very interesting 2 cents. When you talk about other players in SMR you mean Oklo? I picked RR since they have a very solid existing business and will get lots of UK governmental support and contracts to succeed.

I think wallstreet institutional is starting to join the Reddit train as they wake up to company's solid growth figures. Feel like the 120s at start of the week was a nice buy opportunity. I'm sure it'll have random  falls in coming weeks gonna keep some cash on hand to capitalise when it does imo; Is PE the most relevant metric for a company that just broke even? Shown pretty good same store and new store top line growth. But I agree wouldn't touch it at current price levels; It just feels like they are trading on real things happening compared to trading more on sentiment; OKLO is a good example. Like every theme or sub industry in the early days, it's hard to say who the winners will be. Maybe pick more than one. Maybe put a position into an etf as well; Aren't all the space stocks to an extent trading on sentiment?; Everything trades on sentiment to some degree. But my comment was really about the extent to which things trade on sentiment, not whether they do at all. It feels like rocketlab is trading on sentiment plus real things as opposed to merely sentiment and expectations of future real things."
202,Good or bad idea to sell my top holdings and just put it into the s&p500?,No content,https://i.redd.it/7teas9n06g2e1.jpeg,661,2024-11-22 13:32:03,"What I can tell you is get out of cash app; Don't sell. Just invest new funds into the s&p.; Dude idk if u know but whatever ur holding is like 1/2 of the SPY...; Your current holdings are about 20% of S&P already and also most likely the biggest drivers of growth in the index. Maybe trim Nvidia since you're up big already and put that into S&P so you still have some skin within the broad index and the index's top performers.; Would be conservative.

Nobody will be able to accurately answer your question.; Understand the capital gains taxes you would have to pay for selling and revisit this question.; I like your portfolio and think it will outperform the S&P 500. I would not sell if you incur capital gains tax, unless you are in a low tax bracket. If you want less risk then I might consider putting half in an S&P 500 fund for the fun of comparing. Also, I love a new ETF, TOPT comprised of the top twenty stocks by market capitalization. I think it will outperform + gives the diversification you are considering.; Dont sell nvidia yet; If you’re unsure you could sell half of each and put into S&P500?

You’d keep half your positions and get the S&P you’re curious about too.; Bad idea, assuming this is a taxable account and you have income, because you'll create a taxable event and lose a portion of your gains.  If you want to diversify, would be better to add new money and buy different things, even if it takes some time.; Great idea. You’ll be diversified and have international exposure too. 40% of S&P 500 revenue is from overseas. On average if you include dividends the S&P 500 returns about 10% annually we are in a bull market so you can do better than that the next few years. Statistics show that most people don’t beat the market. Better to be in the S&P 500 index and be safe than count on an outlier return playing individual stocks.; I don't want to tell you what to do but... the Nasdaq-100 out paces the S&P500 on the 1,3,5 and 10 year timeframe.  So... just keep that in mind.; Nvidia has upside potential, Tesla also, Microsoft as well... I would be REALLY peaceful holding those even though they have pumped massively; Aren’t these the top earners of the s&p? Why sell them for a product diluted with inferior (relatively speaking) stocks? Imo just buy the s&p when you have new money; Why the hell would you sell Nividia their the #1 stock to hold long term imo; Unless you don't believe in them anymore, I'd keep them but rebalance by starting to put money into S&P.; No, you have the best companies in it right now, hold them forever.; I definitely wouldn’t sell and pay taxes. Instead just start only investing in index funds; It's a risk, but you don't have that much investment (may be to you :) ) so I'd add new money to S&P but leave this. These companies are pretty likely to continue beating the market in my view, even if they dip 30% tomorrow or what not.; i would take profits like 10-20% and the rest hold. profits i would hold for now as fiat till times are better to reinvest.; Are you doing better than the index? If not sell them, otherwise hold them.; I unloaded my holdings into various SPY ETFs in September and my portfolio is stronger than ever. Most top managers don’t even out perform the market, so I know I won’t. I am better off just riding with it; Do you think that's a good idea after holding for like 20 years?; Trim some Tesla and Nvidia put it into SCHD and VOO; Take the profits and put them in the s&p, leaving your original investment in each?; Only if you think you don't deserve the returns you are getting. I mean, why sell winners to a buy a bag of lower performers?; It’s only $10k just let it ride; Only if you did options you Willy; Mstr all in; Sell it and buy some weed; Get FBTC; Why would you sell your 7 winners to buy 493 losers?; Good idea imo; Why would you sell your best performing stocks and keep your worst performing ones? Your logic is backwards; If I were you, I wouldn't. At least not in near future (next year). Depends on how much is capital gains tax on stocks in USA (I am not from USA, so I don't know.) In my country it is 15%. This means If I were to sell, I would have had 15% less to invest in S&P 500, and I don't think S&P 500 is going to outperform those stocks by 15% in next year. ; Sell Berkshire, old man buffet will kick the bucket; You'd be a fool to do that. Your portfolio is one to hold for life.; Given that top stocks have about a 5-10 year life cycle, yes. Given that the these top stocks seem invincible, no. Given that the SP500 includes all this and weighted for them, yes. Depends on what you think and when you want to potentially liquidate.; I’ve been selling and putting the proceeds into MSTR, but I haven’t sold any of my S&P500; YET. !!; My friend, it is never a bad idea to go to more diversified funds that have a more broad range to help you achieve what you want which is long term success. You won’t regret it if you do; You can obviously trim some portion of the shares if you don’t want to sell the entire position. Bigger question is where would you invest the new capital. If there are investment opportunities offering higher return than the current investments then it is worth doing it. 
Having said that investors with big portfolios tend to sell a portion of position if it becomes more than lets say 15% (a number they are comfortable with) so as to minimize the downside exposure but since you are starting out you can take more risk and these companies are some of the best in the world. The positions you have (mag 7 and brk) right now drive the s&p 500 index, so essentially you would get similar returns if you invested in s&p 500 index fund (aka you are already invested in s&p500 index fund); Why not sell them and put it in berk.
He seems to know something is coming 🤔; ""should i sell sp500 to buy sp500"" is basically what you're asking, given your portfolio; How has no one asked if this is in a taxable brokerage or a tax sheltered account? If it's in a regular taxable account, I'd just hold at least until the funds hit the long-term gains territory. Even then, I might not sell. Just add on top into the S&P500. If in a tax sheltered account, I would consider selling maybe Google and Berkshire.; You’ve done well with your purchases if your gut is telling you to be safe right now it may be right.; Hi I just explained this somewhere else actually- time to reiterate the comment.

Buy low, sell high


Those aren’t meaningless numbers designed to only go up, they are securities. With assets. You bought something when investing your money.

You’ve bought ownership in those companies, determine if the value of the ownership is worth more or less than what you can sell it for.

Don’t try to guess either, run numbers, look at the financials, etc. rn I can give you advice that basically everything is overpriced, and basically all tech is overpriced by a significant factor. 

Buffet is famous because he simply can rather accurately determine what’s “low” and what’s “high”

If the value of ownership in the company is worth less than what the market is paying for it- sell it off at a premium.

If the value of ownership in the company is worth more than what the market is asking for it- buy it at the discount.


Concerning yourself with the “what-ifs” will be the most effective way to turn investing into gambling.

If somebody is offering right now to pay $75 for a $50 item, why the hell should you risk the deal to see if some other guy is going to offer you $100 for it?; I predict small dip then rise again during president  inauguration... but I might very well be wrong.; Or, let your winners ride.; Now or never, don’t ever try to time the market; What's your other investment like or this is it? Personally, if you can tolerate downs keep it as it is because you are likely trading the profit you make to pay more for similar stocks in sp500; No one ever went broke taking a profit; Nice collection there on your portfolio. Congrats! 

But listen even if you sell all and pump in s&p how much stocks would you be able to buy? 
And if you have just more of a one stock then your portfolio will swing up and down heavily.; Bad; Consider a fun energy play in the meantime or buy some doge coins or something; Your top holdings are the s&p500; You're holding a large portion of the S&Ps biggest names anyway, divesting and moving over in essence buys you back fractions of your current holdings with exposure to others. Wouldn't really gain anything expect diversification.; We’re in a global liquidity surge so riskier assets are about to perform better than average; I would leave it alone .  Just put small amounts into new fund . Do a weekly into voo or qqq etc . However much you can afford and have it automatically take from your bank account per week . 25 per week etc .; I do fnilx just to have something more stable; Your top holdings basically are the snp right now - you’ll just lose money on taxes if you switch.; Not a fan of google; Why? You're in elite leading stocks, the right place to be during a roaring bull market.

If this is your entire portfolio, then one could make a case for better diversification especially if this bull market runs into some trouble. But if you have diversification elsewhere, I'd say ride the leaders until they stop leading.; Wait to see if capital gains drop under Trump.; ""HOLD BROTHERS! HOLD!""; Hold everything except TSLA. artificially high due to the post election buzz and the prospect of Elon capitalizing on his position. The EV competition is real and will impact TSLAs ability to continue to grow going forward.; Do you have a roth ira?  If not start one.  You can trade for free in a roth as long as you don’t withdraw until you are around 60.  ; I thought we were talking about life changing money then I clicked; Your base is basically SP, I would hold and diversify into US value stocks; S and p future growth for next 10 years 3-6% I would find better opportunities; You’re basically invested in the SP500. You will get more diversification if you put it into the SP500, so you might reduce volatility. But if you can the correlation of returns of your stocks, it should be basically 95% correlated with the SP500. I would not suggest selling because of taxes, and I would invest new money directly into sp500; How does yours show your average buy price on that screen? Is it a different app?; Isn't that just the S&P; This is tough. It really depends on what YOU want to do. I don’t think there’s any problem with no diversifying a portfolio if you want to take on the risk. Tech is a great investment, but I personally would want to diversify more. I don’t see these holdings tanking anytime soon. But if for some reason, tech crashes, you’re screwed! These are already the top holdings in the S&P. I agree with the top comment, keep these and only buy new shares of S&P from here; Yes. Best idea you’ve had. You’ve done well with these, but long term, you’re not going to beat the S&P. Take the win and move to S&P 500 knowing you’re well diversified. You’ve made money. Make money, don’t lose it.; I prefer VTI over SPY. You’re missing out on small and mid cap with SPY.; I did buy 2,100 shares of Tesla when it was $250; keep whT you havr; LOL this list _IS_ the S&P500; No. Goldman Sachs projects 3% SP annual growth for the next decade.; If you want to play it safe but still get maximum growth exposure, Sell equal to your original investment, put THAT in the S&P; You’re basically holding s&p 500 with those stocks; I don't think anyone could give you good advice here without knowing a little bit about you or making several assumptions.

I am guessing you are quite young and your intentions with these savings are to save for eventual retirement or are you saving for short term goal ? 

If you have a shorter-term goal, selling some to protect the funds needed could certainly make a lot of sense. 

In a handful of stocks concentrated in mostly one industry, you're certainly not well diversified or positioned for a liquidity event.

However if your time horizon is very long and you are saving new funds in regularly, there's no issue holding onto these and buying regularly some international exposure and some US market broad exposure through a couple ETFs. That could certainly be a smart strategy for the long term.

But your time horizon, risk capacity and goals for the funds really need to be known to give any type of quality advice to you.; Nothing wrong to put in S&P, but I wouldn’t do this move. ; Don’t sell the $NKE, they will be start accepting $BTC in January.; Your top holdings are the sandp 500; Let your winners run and cut your losses yesterday🍻; If I was you I will cash out and put 30% of my profit into S&P 500; You’re already in the S&P 500…; Calls on CELH; Brother you are basically holding the S&P with those holdings; Bad. S&P is weighted down by stagnant companies. Rather substitute individual stocks for other stocks you feel will grow.; Currently you’re a bit tech heavy. I like a 80% index / 20% individual stock split.; If you are making 200% returns a year, why would you switch to S&P?; Buy qqq instead, it currently sits sinds its debut and an average of 14% yearly average return and this is includes the dotcom bust. These days nasdaq 100 is much better balanced. Don’t bet on the horse, buy the race track!; This shit can’t sustain… investors should be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.  -Buffet; Sp500 should buy you instead!!; QQQ all in one; What app is that?; What I would do is trim every investment that you are over 2x on and invest the profit into a broad market index fund. That way you can let your investments ride for free and all that profit was reinvested and diversified; What platform are you using?; Just put new money into it. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it type vibes here.; I say hold and forget it.  Then pump into index funds of choice.  Sell when you need income.; Never listen to ppl on this sub. Do what you think is right. 

People on this sub can't predict the future and are not financial advisors.; Doing well so far

You might be one of the few that can beat the market

Of course if that stops working, just go back to S&P; Invest in TLT share 20y profit; With these amounts you should look for a $3B to $6B market company and go all in and see it 300x hopefully; DO NOT SELL ANY OF THAT. what are you thinking.?; Good idea is to add KULR , ARMN , & LODE; You don’t have enough for it to matter. Continue to purchase in index fund and the current top holdings will be diluted; yeah just keep investing. tbf what you have is pretty indicative of the wider market anyway.

Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, etc. aren't niche picks, they make up a significant part of the s&p already.

You'd be selling apple to buy apple imo.; Let your winners run; $apld; Keep etf sell the rest when you are comfortable. Every bubble burst at some point. Unless trumps puts the printing machine on over drive for government  expending we are going to see a good drop.; People may not want to hear this, but sell all of it, put it into indexes 


Before the orange toddler shits all over 2025 and on; No not all lol this portfolio is amazing; Sell and buy VT. Valuation on the us market is fucking bonkers. International is undervalued imo ; Regardless of what you decide, congrats on those percentages.; Not worth selling when you’re really just starting your journey. It’s not like you half a mill in a few stocks. Do what other people said and just buy new shares.; I wouldn’t sell unless you have to or you have a loss. You’ll have to pay taxes on gains. Put any new money into s&P or something safer.; Only if you want to realize some gains in a low income year.; Think about using stops. Not too tight, maybe 5%. Then if one sells put that money in the s&p.  If the stock appreciates you may have to move your stops. 
These mag 7 stocks are overbought but great long-term pics.; “Don’t cut your flowers and water your weeds”; You don’t have enough money to be making it worth your while with individual stocks. S&P index fund and call it a day.; AAPL and TSLA have more

The other Mag7 are kinda similar in the clouds space

DIA is another less volatile option; Keep what you have and simply start buying the s&p if you want the exposure. Add to what you have as well.  Throw in some t bills.; This is my dream; Or just buy ibit = 1 year 156%; Terrible idea. Would it lower your risk, absolutely but the only reason investing in the s&p500 makes any profit is because of those companies you already own and a few more. If you’re 60+, it’s probably not a bad idea but if you’re younger than that it’s a terrible idea imho; I would sell and wait for the s&p crash that is overdue.; The market seems like it is broadening out from the mag 7. S&P allows you to broaden out as well.; Consider selling stocks on which you have a loss to see if it will reduce tax liability.; You are basically holding FNGU; What app/platform is this? Thanks; Don’t sell no reason to pay taxes on those gains. You can always sell some covered calls for income….; With Musk about to live in the White House, might as well keep Tesla, it still hasn't gotten back to it its all time highs; Everything here has plenty of room to grow. 

The only one I'm skeptical on is Tesla but it's clear the next four years they'll continue to receive preferential treatment. If there's ever a big political shift left they may get their subsidies cut, but until then you should let it ride.

Just start putting new cash into the S&P 500 going forward.; Nvidia is overvalued and most people who bought the company don’t know specifically what they do. “They make chips for GPU’s”😂; S&P gives 13% return YOY. You are outperforming them with ur skill, if you want to play safe then Liquidate some nvidia and invest that money into s&p; Honestly? Do nothing don’t sell. That’s a good portfolio there.

If you really really want to remanage your risk, maybe drop TSLA and put that into an ETF instead. But that’s about it.; Your top two are basically garbage hype gambling machines.  Id take the gains and invest into some of your other holdings which are wonderful long term businesses.; Selll and hold cash; SPY all day.; Why on EARTH, would you sell, The ONLY Companies, building, growing, supporting, feeding the S&P,  ljust to pay fees and loose all that growth, just to hold the S&P and the other 497??????; Your remarks resonate with my situation, and I have the same question as OP - in my case, regarding Disney shares I’ve had since 1987. Hoping to retire in a few years AND husband laid off in October (so less income to declare) makes me think that getting out of DIS now is a good move. 

I’ve already sold any partial shares (dividend reinvestments) where the difference between current price and purchase price isn’t too big. But I’m nervous about selling the rest. 

Let’s pretend my cost basis was 0 to simplify (actual CB has been difficult to track since there have been multiple stock splits).

I’ve held onto DIS thru thick and thin, and I see the share price is finally climbing again after some painful years… but getting out now and paying taxes on ~45k would still ease some worries. 

All this to say… any advice? Anything I’m not taking into consideration?  Appreciate any feedback.; If its essentiall the top 50 holdings of s&p, the correlation is pretty tight so its fairly equiv exposure with more alpha and vol than the etf.; What application is this? Revolut?; You have the heaviest weighted stocks in S&P….if they drop S&P drops; Bro, your portfolio IS the S&P500 🤣; If you only have 2 or 3 shares of a particular stock then yeah.; Good idea 👍; You've invested into some very good companies, don't get out. Stay in. If they drop lower then buy more. Tracking the s&p500 just for market average returns isn't going to get you far.; That’s a smart idea because single stocks can be easily manipulated. There’s a lot going on in the world, and some companies don’t always have the best strategies, so it’s better not to take on too much risk. However, don’t invest a lump sum, add more gradually whenever the market drops, because a correction is bound to happen. I prefer Fidelity FXAIX; You’re basically already investing in the same stuff the s&p does. You will get better returns here with a slightly higher risk.; no, but if you want to generate some cash you could scale out of some of them. NVDA -2.23, TSLA -1 (this can continue higher to $400 however earnings will likely bring it down after all of this election hype), AAPL keep, GOOGL keep for now. it's down on DOJ which will likely not be an issue once Trump's administration takes over, MSFT - keep, BRKB keep. then you wait ... wait for another day or week for the market to sell off then put your profits in an ETF.  If you want some boring stuff ... TGT just dumped on er this week and it's already +$5, has div. You want something sexy WULF has backed off of recent highs.; bad hold; It's better then my stock my stock just got a letter from saying their not in compliance 😂; Just put a sensible stop loss on everything so you can take gains if the market drops and separately build up funds in S&P 500.; Hold; Is good obviously!; Isnt thjs basically the sp500?!??!! Lol; Take apple out of the line up.; Lol the snp500 has the exact same top holdings.; Please don’t do that; I honestly don't see the point in selling since if you buy an S&P, you would have to end up owning the exact same companies you do now anyway (plus you would incur taxes on the sale).; So much bad advice being given it's actually insane. Total US or S&p500 is more diversified and less risky. Listen to Warren buffet, bogle, and vanguard. Picking individual stocks is gambling I don't care how successful they are. Own the whole pie not just part of it. The idea is to set it and forget it in a broad based index fund. Investing 101; There are a lot of arguments for diversification, but some would argue that it’s selling your winners to buy the losers.

You could reallocate a percentage of your winners into SPY, but not 100% in case of further run ups in these tech/AI names.; Sleep and hold; Dump that Berkshire crap; Whats the app you use; Warren is pulling out money from stocks and routing into bonds.. maybe good time to lower your positions of tech stocks, they seem to be overvalued…; Bro, i’m late to this but your a holding the wants and needs of the people. You are already winning. You will have a higher average return holding these and adding more winners in the future. Hold etf in like retirement account.; Taking profits is never a bad move.; Your top holdings are the S&P 500 lol; Haha you’d be selling half the SP500 to buy SP500; Dude that is the S&P 500.; Basically your top Holdings are the s$p lol...; Not yet sp hit all time highs etc you’re buy in price would be wayyyy too high; Put a trailing stop loss and let them run, then decide.; Let your winners run; I would suggest you to keep it there and make the compound interest magic happen!; You’re practically holding the S&P already with this positions. 

Only benefit is the S&P will automatically adjust to whatever the next big thing is.; Why would you sell? HODL till 2030. Unless you need the money.; I have two brokers with two different firms. Recommended I trump proof my holdings. I exchanged all of my tech holdings for others that are not in the tariffs wars about to happen.; You’re basically holding VGT so just buy VGT; I’d bank at least half the Nvidia gains into a money market account and roll the rest into a Russell 2000 fund. Also wouldn’t be bad to just park all the Nvidia and Tesla gains in a money market and see what happens after Jan 20th. Cash is king in market corrections; Well based on your holding, when you buy S&P 500 you are putting your money back in the same place.

7% each to Nvda, M; Sell Microsoft and Berkshire 🤣; How old are you and who have u been listening too 🗺️; I am interesting, what brokers do you use?; I think it is depend from tour whole portfolio.. I mean s&p it is average of 500 companies. You can look inside, what are they and what you have and then  compare.; The 4% ""rule"" is crazy. What if you live longer. Going back to the workforce? Or ""Oh, my kids will help me."" Wrong! They have their own lives and kids to take care of! Retirement is using your money to work for you, not to deplete it. If you take out, but don't put in, you do the math.; Bro, buy crypto, 30x your money, and never look back at old boring stocks; I recently shed stock investments and rotated to overweight bonds (TLT, IEF). I’m assuming tariffs and spending cuts are coming…IMO with yield inversion, price increases coupled with cuts, there will be recession and correction.; Or just buy new shit next paycheck buy Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs’s get some nee get some avuv get some gd rtx; Good idea.; You can take stocks you own and buy an index of stocks you don’t own. Depends on if you want rights to your stocks or not; Lots of funds are piling into $GME, lots of speculation they bought $BTC at $65,000,000.@

I think between collectibles and the ability to purchase crypto/stocks.. this company is not going to slow down.; No LLY or COST? I find that really weird.; Sell everything just keep Amazon; Sell and short RDDT.; You got great diversification and the top players.  Your pretty low risk already. I would invest new money in etf's but I wouldn't shuffle out.; Just leave it. You have the mag7. 
You are already holding a lot of the s&p 500 by doing that.
Diversification means you invest in other assets, bonds, real estate, crypto, etc.
I would just try and find other investment opportunities to see if you could squeeze out something so you do better than the s&p. 
Buy some dedicated/focused etfs like energy / Indian market etc. Something you think will boost your returns over the top of the s&p.; Can I ask why? I know it’s restrictive in day trading and obviously no options, but I’ve been using it for a bit and it’s honestly not bad; Losing money in Revolut? Yeah, sure, bro; 100% this. Especially since it’s not a whole lot of money and this way you avoid any potential taxes on gains.; I vote what this guy said; This is what I would do. Invest new funds into a well diversified ETF (S&P 500 or a more global fund for even more diversification).; You think avoid all world ETFs because of Tariffs on horizon?; Definitely the best plan.; Yes but he should consider equal weighted sp since he obviously is super concentrated on mag 7

$rsp; This is what I did. Just putting money in index funds now. Building those up. Also any dividends from those stocks / funds get automatically reinvested.; This is why I asked should I just put it into the spy or sp500; What he said; agree trim nvidia; This is the best advice; I second this! S&P gives 13% return YOY. Liquidate nvidia and invest that money into s&p; Don’t trim Nvidia. Sell the s%p and put it all in on Nvidia. Who the fuck is this guy anyways?; S&P 500 isn't conservative, bonds and treasuries are conservative.; I can, it’s just behind a paywall; Or Tesla;  This supports my investment strategy:  “Diversity is for Suckers”; Some people didn't get the ""never bet against Nvidia"" memo.; Depends why he wants to sell. A lot of indicators to say it’s pretty overpriced right now and in line for another correction. With the markets about to likely sour once Trump is in office, id say selling high and waiting for that dip could be a good way to cement profit. But, he wants to jump into SPY instead, so I doubt that is his intention…; Agree ! No way; James J Cramer stated in 1999 that internet companies “are the only ones worth owning right now.”
That they “are the only ones that are going higher consistently in good days and bad.”; If you already sell the asset for more than the value, it’s not a risk at all.

He is strictly profiting from such a transaction.

It’s actually a risk to continue holding because the asset can return to its actual value; Reposting this quote for a 2nd time now:

“If you’re out of this sector, you’re going to underperform. You’re in a horse and buggy, and I’m in a Porsche. You don’t like tenfold growth opportunities? Then go with someone else.” - Alberto Vilar, 1999; Buy low, sell high.; As if he doesn’t know that; you think he's doing much day to day; Yeah, it’ll either keep on going up forever or you’ll want to jump off a bridge


Either way, you’re holding it for life!; Agree and if he/ she wants to invest in etf can even do it slowly . 100 a month etc .; And how is that going for you?; Common boglehead W; Yes that’s why I asked is it a good or bad idea; Sell it all and put it on red; Buy low, sell high

It’s not timing the market if your following basic entrepreneurial strategy; Actually one of the best takes in the comment section; Wow, somebody sane and looking at data instead of making the gamble that the funny numbers will only go up forever; Lmt is the only fairly priced defense stock imo; How the hell are you going to price something with 0 underlying value.

BTC inherently can’t be priced because it doesn’t mean anything; I don’t, personally I believe the ownership of those companies are heavily overpriced.

LLY is seeing some congressional trade, but I simply can’t invest in good faith with the current pricing

This is strictly my personal opinion though; I'm not sure you know what diversification means; Bro just open up a fidelity; Information. You have much more info in legacy trading apps. It helps you make decisions (and see how your decisions played out over time). If your rebuttal is “well, I can just get that info on Yahoo finance.” True, but it’s nice not to have to switch between apps, and those other sources won’t automatically track your tickers; Cash app is a fintech that does its business through partner banks. In this case, cash app doesn’t lend you the securities in a sense - the underlying bank does. These relationships can go bad at anytime (yotta for example) and people get locked out of thousands of dollars. 

Pick a brick and mortar brokerage that’s vertically integrated like fidelity, shwab, vanguard, because they own their securities and control everything. There’s no risk to losing your money at these big banks because there will never be a problem with solvency***. They typically don’t halt trading or set any arbitrary limits either because again, they own every step of the process.; Quality? Customer service? Why is this even a question.; Agreed; Could you explain please?; These gains might be low enough as to not incur capital gains tax.; OP should sell at a time when he won't get taxed, right?; I’m not familiar with this particular app but I don’t see where it mentions that this is a taxable account; You’re not avoiding shit. Lol. When you eventually decide to sell, you pay taxes. Period.; Me too. I’ve always like the Wealthfront distribution based on my risk aversion.; This is definitely something to think about.; Definitely. Plus it’s good to diversify and if the US economy happens to go belly up as some keep suggesting then you’re not going to lose the lot ☺️; which index funds?; top signal; SPY is the index fund of the S&P 500. They’re essentially the same thing. S&P is just an index and not an actual ETF, SPY is the ETF; SPY or VTI. Both are good if you want to hold and chill.; The reality is the top 3 holdings in SPY/S&P 500 is Nvda, Aapl and Msft at about 6%+ each.  The top 10 include Goog, BRK, etc.  Selling what you have now marginally increases diversification as most of your money is going right back to the same stocks.

Add Avgo and Meta and you would own the top 10 which are weighted over 34% of the entire index.

Go look at a list of the holdings in SPY (this is an ETF of S&P 500).

I would leave it the way it is now to not create a taxable event and add SPY as you add to your portfolio.; or she. Or post above; S&P 500 averages about 10% over decades.  The top 3 holdings are Aapl, Nvda and Msft at 7% each.; It would be more conservative than his current strategy; bonds and treasuries aren't conservative, NFTs of funny monkey are conservative.; It's all relative.; The verb, right?; “If you’re out of this sector, you’re going to underperform. You’re in a horse and buggy, and I’m in a Porsche. You don’t like tenfold growth opportunities? Then go with someone else.” - Alberto Vilar, 1999; Wasn't this the same for TSLA at one point? Bet on TSLA, til it doesn't work? I'm holding TSLA and NVDA, but how much higher is this thing gonna go?; lol the day trump won the market went up so I’d say it’s going to be a good 4 years; His death will plummet the stock; Like everything else, I won’t know until I sell, however if I was to sell now/today.  I’d have quite a bit more profit from MSTR, than if I’d have left it where it was or put it into S&P500; Don’t sell just to put it right back, that’s just paying tax for no reason.

I would however recommend selling and locking in those profits, then putting money into a 1-5yr AAA bond or TBill depending on how active you plan on being for the next few years.

Just remember, stocks are only this high not because the value of the companies are actually this high, but because people are willing to buy the ownership at this price.

Check out the airline industry of the 1920s and internet stocks of the 1998-2000s. Obvious growth of an industry does NOT translate to obvious profits for investors. When everything is priced in this high, there is only one way left for the stock to go.


I’m not a financial advisor (legally required to say this); I feel like my sanity is only a retrospective outcome. My crystal ball is made from frosted glass and I’ve been whipped enough to favor safety.; Not true all of them r cheap incl lmt  lmt is the cheapest. . But Atleast for long run . All missiles need to be replenish euro poors will keep buying from us and trump likes spending on military so that will continue .; I am paying USD for BTC, what’s the underlying value?; lmao literally all tech; Can you really be diversified with 6k lol. Tech is the only place to be with that chump change.; [deleted]; Honestly, diversify. Any of these could go belly up tomorrow.; Can you elaborate?  What information do you look at? I have most of my money in E*Trade/Morgan Stanley and never look at more than my gains/losses.  I guess I underutilize these platforms?  Would be great to learn from you here.; Yeah I’ve seen this argument mainly, and like you said I just use yahoo finance. It was just easier because I already had cash app setup. What alternatives do you suggest?; Alright, so what would be the alternative? Just robinhood or something? I know back when GameStop happened they did a similar thing and froze accounts, so I stayed away for that reason.

Any other trading apps that would be better? I started off small, but have grown my portfolio quite a bit so looking to do something more stable and safe like you said; You pay taxes on your gains when you sell your shares 

If the total profit is say 3000$, and capital gains is at 50%, you pay taxes on  1500$. If your tax bracket is 30%, thats about 500$ due next year. 

Instead, if you hold and don't sell, that 500$ growing at say 8% will give you an extra 40$ by the end of next year compounding for as long as you don't sell; Also be aware of first in first out (FIFO) rules when you are trading. I got burned to the tune of about 11k in gains that I didn't even receive because I wasn't aware of those rules at the time.; There is no reason for OP to pay the taxes right now since it sounds like OP would take that money and put it in the s&p right away. Much rather pay any kind of tax down the road vs now since money is more valuable now than it will be even a year from now. 

Additionally there is a difference in the amount you pay if you held under a year or over a year and it can be significantly different depending on your level of income.

If you sell during retirement using 2025 numbers you don’t pay up to the first 48k in capital gains. 

There are easily ways to either reduce taxes paid or even eliminate it completely.; VTI, SPY; VOO. QQQ FXAIX is good ones; It's eventually gonna come down, but zero indicators now. Buy buy buy. DCA will clear your mind; They?; Yes right lol, she.; But they said ""conservative"" not ""more conservative."" It's a good point/argument to make that index funds aren't a ""conservative"" investment just because theyre more conservative than picking specific stocks.; I'm glad he didn't say Lambo; Alright bro. Solid financial advice; Youre trading a volitile stock, i hope you have the right strategy cause when btc will correct so will mstr and it won't be nice.; Can you provide what you did for calculations?
Most of the ones I’ve calculated are way overpriced except for Lockheed; What I mean is: there is nothing supporting its cost

Traditionally, stocks and other securities have real value in the real world.

When you buy apple stock, you are buying ownership in apple. You can actually estimate how much that cut is worth by estimating the value that apple will provide.

It’s a lot like when you buy a house, you actually own something and can be sold. You can estimate how much it’s worth by estimating the value of the commodity.

Bitcoin has nothing underneath it except an engine of people tossing money into it. It’s quite literally a Ponzi Scheme; If being hacked “to shreds” meant having 0.15% of your clients having their ssn leaked with no accounts being compromised, then I suppose they were.

I mean it’s certainly not great and shouldn’t of happened. But, a large chunk of us citizens have already probably have had their social be leaked from even bigger beaches.

Healthcare breaches alone had leaked about a third of America’s socials, not to mention the alleged newer breach at a background checker that would have compromised about 270m people; Fidelity is not going belly up tomorrow lmao, this isn’t FTX; Excuse me?; How much DD do you do? Are you picking individual stocks or just investing in ETFs? Are you trading options or just buy and hold? The more granular you get, the more data you’ll want. It’s why traders pay thousands of dollars for a Bloomberg terminal: all publicly available info is at their fingertips.; I liked TD Ameritrade, but they got bought and I was shifted to Schwab, which is… fine. I just buy and hold, mainly individual companies and a few ETFs, so the most important to me in a brokerage app is being able to see real time top level financial info (dividend, PE, EPS) and historical charts for those companies and my finances. Robinhood, for instance, has really shitty graphs and historical data (like, unlabeled x axes egregious). Personally, Trading View is fantastic (and free) for financial data and DD research. It’s not a brokerage app, so I don’t have my own picks on there, but the depth of data and ability to compare stocks is really great.; He mentioned 3 great alternatives wym; Fidelity or Schwab. I'd stay away from Vanguard due to extremely poor UI and customer service is going downhill.; You're maybe just using imaginary numbers but there is no way it's 50% tax if you're American. With these percentage gains they are likely long term gains so it would be 15%. Even if they were short term gains, the amounts are so small it makes me think OP probably isn't high income so their tax bracket even on short term gains is probably in the 22-24% range. 

That said, with this risky of a portfolio NEVER make investment decisions based on taxes. You could hold a stock to wait for it to go long term to save 7% in taxes and meanwhile the stock drops 10%. The opposite can be true too, you figure it's already long term so taxes are fixed at 15% and sell and then it shoots up more. 

There are only some rare conditions where you should be concerned about taxes and it's minimal. Things like getting laid off so you'll have a down income year that puts you in a lower bracket for short term gains. Stuff like that.; But then again you will be taxed for the ""extra"" from that 8% no...? Or am I missing something very fundamental...; So when does one sell?.  I’m in a similar situation with a bunch of stocks in my Brokerage account that performed exceedingly well.  All long term investments: SHOP, APPL, AMZN, FTNT, MSFT - should I not take some cream from the top?  (Im 51 now and try to figure out how and when to retire); I hate your profile photo. It's brilliant.; That's weird. In the US you get taxed when you sell positions? In Europe it's only when you take it out of your account, unless you're a professional trader.; not every country has taxes on capital gains...; What happens say if you make another trade where you lose $3000? Do you still pay taxes or do the profit and loss cancel out so no taxes?; This person is using the terms incorrectly. Do not listen.; That’s all well and good for index funds and completely agree. Actually I did not know about the $48K. But we are talking about individual stocks. 

The idea that he’s going to hold onto these handful of individual stocks for 30-50 years doesn’t seem realistic. The chances these stocks will stay on top of their respective industries is low. At some point well before retirement, he’s going to want to trim these stocks and take some profit and rebalance.; It; Agreed, but BTC has a long way to go, but yes it’s volatile.; Way over priced bro ? rtx pe is 21 lmt is 18.21 gd is 22.7 . I’d say anything below
30 is a buy …… 
All stocks are overvalued right now . 
Lmt is def a buy too . I’m also focused on financials , space stocks ,  mid caps and industrials .; I want to say thank you for being very concise and articulate in your reply. With that being said, I decide where value lies. Our opinions may differ, may yours retire your bloodline.; Saw a little while back where 2.9b social security numbers along with addresses were stolen.[SSN Breach](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2024/08/17/social-security-hack-national-public-data-confirms/74843810007/); [deleted]; Got it. Yeah - I just buy and hold. Ideally I don’t spent a lot of time on my finances.  But I’m trying to retire in the next 5 years and so I want to ensure I can manage my money accordingly.; Bloomberg Terminal subscription is 25k a year. I don't think the normal retail trader is willing to pay for that. That is for a serious trader that has money to burn. I have never heard of it until you mentioned it.; You're right, I'm in Canada and we don't have short/long term gains taxes anymore and a blanket 50% capital gains tax on all equity returns but it's conceptually similar to the US 

I agree with your point on not making decisions primarily on tax loss harvesting. I was responding to how ""not selling helps save money"" in a broad sense; Agree to this. I made a mistake of not selling my espp to save taxes when it was high and now the stock is lower than my purchase price. 

Not selling to save taxes is a bad decision; 50% capital gain , pay 30% tax; 30% here in France 🫠; Yep! But when you sell that eventually   

So assume that the 40$ you earned in my hypothetical here is realized and sold in 2026, 20$(here in Canada) of that gain will be added to your annual income and you'll have to pay 30% of that 20$ in taxes in 2027 - 6$; As you are getting close to retirement converting some in Dividend stocks could be a good  options and regarding the selling you can sell it and you will just have to put the 20% capital gains tax at max no matter the amount is and if it's less then 500k then you have to just pay 15% tax which is reasonable.; Your accountant will be able to give you better advice than most people here would with incomplete information. Sorry if that's not helpful; If you have descendants then it's best to never sell tbh. When you die the cost basis gets reset and none of the taxes on gains are collected. 

That said most people don't think like that. It's probably a good idea for you to sell some and rebalance. Be careful about realizing the gains. Depending on which state you're in (e g. WA), there's additional taxes if you exceed a certain amount (250k>). 

Also, the ACA tax applies if you make a certain amount (250k as a single), which you probably won't after you retire. So it could be preferable to defer sales until then. 

I usually rebalance at the end of the year and try to take advantage of tax loss harvesting, but I also have a slew of unrealized long term gains that I'm sitting on. Everyone has their own unique set of circumstances.; 10% trailing stop loss. Protect your profits, with the ability to still grow. Its a win win; \> So when does one sell?

While I understand all these ""don't sell or you'll pay taxes"" comments, obviously you can sell if you need money, say to buy a house or a car or a phone or something. You know what I mean. I always sell for profit if I need money for something. I pay the taxes and move on. After all the tax is based on the profit. If I made $10000 profit, I pay the 26% tax on that and use the remaining 74% to buy the stuff I need.; 😄; Correct; Correct. Taxes are calculated from your annual income and all losses through investments in stocks and stuff reduce your annual income and tax liability; Since it's a small account, It's more tax efficient to just rebalance using new funds.

Also, you can always do a portfolio backed loan later to access liquidity instead of realizing taxes.

For now, that loophole is open, and will probably stay that way.; How did it age? you're already out of the trade?; You just feel they’re not overpriced and so now they aren’t? What formulas do you use?

RTX has a P/E ratio of a company that is growing, but it’s simply not growing much per year. They have a 3.5% revenue growth per year (which is surprisingly generous, it’s 4.5% with cherry picking), and they’re priced as if it’s about 15% per year.

The growth they have simply doesn’t justify the price of the asset. (Btw this is how you avoid overpriced stocks- you do the math and estimate their worth)

It’s also generous to say Lmt is priced fairly, because I’m getting varying results depending on the model I’m using. Either way, there isn’t much room for it to reasonably go up more.

I know that undervalued assets exist out there- I’ve found some. Defense is just too hot a sector to be able to find any value in rn in my opinion. (Not a financial advisor); 2.9B? 1/3 of the world’s population? Most of whom won’t have an SSN since that’s an American thing with roughly 320M max. ; Your email is compromised as soon as you sign up to most websites.

This is seriously such a non-issue; Your email is already leaked by equidax 3 years ago. Bro, your shit is all over the internet lol; Yeah, that’s my point…; To clarify both my comments, 50% of gains from assets gets added to the annual income and the tax is THEN calculated based on an individual's tax bracket; I did the same thing. Maybe we worked for the same company. ESPP is particularly dangerous because it's essentially 18 months to get to long term capital gains. 

Invest in companies not in taxes with rare exceptions. I started selling my ESPP / RSU  right on the vest date because it makes taxes easier. Also I got laid off eventually. Not a believer in the company after many years but my compensation was still somewhat tied to it.; Depends on the country. Another comment said Canada has a 50% capital gains tax regardless of term. Either way, you actually aren't that far from billionaires regarding taxes. You can eventually get SBLOCs to make it usable money but you'll still pay interest. 

This is why SPY and VOO even exist and keep growing. People put money in (a managed fund that basically is like trading and you pay a fee for) and never take it out until they retire or die. 

Selling stock can be one of the most beneficial things for your real life. Even if you're at SBLOC levels you're still hit with interest. An SBLOC lasting 5 or so years would even be better off financially as a sale. Why does Elon not do it? Because he wants to keep the voting shares. He is essentially paying more than taxes to ""keep"" the shares that really belong to the bank so that he can keep ruling the company. We're not like that.; Also, I get what you're saying but it's worst case scenario and you're phrasing it like a doomer. 

It probably isn't 30% unless you're high income and it's short term gains. Plus it's 30%  on ""50%"" which would effectively be more like 16% on the initial investment. 

OP has massive gains though. Whenever they sell they are going to get taxed like 2x their initial investment. That's capitalism though. Elon put 100M into Tesla and last year paid something like 19B in taxes just to sell a small fraction of it.; 30% cap gains? Just encourages SBLOCs.  I had margin at like 8%. I'd never sell.  Good? Maybe but it's crazy inflationary.; Thanks for the detailed breakdown!

From my understanding... it isn't worth to min-max perse, as everything with stocks is percentage anyway and it's 'almost' impossible to imagine/process truly how snowball compounding can be.  
I know that ""it"" there but still...

Just that ""percentage of how much"" and back to OP's question, if you have a solid reason to sell, then do you. Hindsight esp. in finance is soo dominating - maybe others can but I will just (try to) chuck it and forget it - so bunch of psychology involved and that's a mess in itself.; Sometimes accountants suck as well, Best is to do research yourself and be your own accountanat.; I sell for profit when I need to buy stuff. What's with all this ""don't sell or you'll pay taxes"" thing. Yes I will but I also invested in something, I made profits and now say I need to change my car so say I need $20,000 cash. Why wouldn't I sell some investments and get my $20,000 (all from profits) to change my car? Yes I will pay some taxes on the profit (26% in my case) but so what? After all I invested to make profit and if I'm never gonna use those profits to buy real life stuff, what's the point?; Where do you keep the 26% you have to pay in taxes?  HSA?; Thanks!; Good points. Does sound like high level recommendations for most people though. Perhaps if working with an accountant for financial advisor. I don’t know that is trust some rando’ person to begin taking out loans against individual stocks.; No, bought more yesterday and looking to buy more soon.; [deleted]; 10 years in infosec says otherwise. 😉

Speak for yourself. 🥃; Yeah I was shocked and didn't read your second comment, googled it, and was going to correct it. From my research, a person with no other income could incur up to $95874 of capital gains and pay as low as 10.03% combined provincial and federal tax in Canada. Same situation in the US, if long-term cap gains (>1yr) would be 0% up to $48350 and 15% after that, plus whatever the state you live in takes.; You're right; Not everyone is desperate for 20k. The difference between selling and deferring can be more than 20%, which can be 100s of thousands Or even millions. That's the point.; It just sits in my bank account or I reinvest it. I'm in Italy, so we don't have something like the HSA.

Basically if I sell some shares in 2024 with €10,000 profit, I need to pay the 26% of those profits as tax in July of 2025. Until then I have €10,000 available to me to spend on stuff. I simply need to make sure that I will have €2,600 for the tax in July 2025.; Oh for sure, goes without saying that professional help is needed if someone is unsure.

My portfolio is a good deal larger and more diversified than OPs, so my strategy is different.; Oh so you agree it’s a non issue? I began reading your response and expected something actually bad. “but emails were leaked-” is actually such a joke way to follow up lmfao; Yeah good luck buddy while ur typing on Reddit; Absolutely! This is what I tried pointing out in my first comment through the calculation but didn't explain it quite as well as you did; Yeah I understand the whole tax implication part, but my point was something else. 20k was just a random number I used. It can also be 1 million. Say you wanna buy a 1 million dollar house and at that moment you don't have 1 million in cash, everything is tied up in stocks.

So obviously you can sell some stocks (say the positions in profit) to make 1 million available to yourself to buy the house you want. That was my point. Like you don't keep investing for no purpose. The whole point of investing is increasing your net worth so that you can use those investments to buy the real life stuff which you need/want.; Yeah your approach makes perfect sense to me; [deleted]; Weird that my calling card amongst IT profs is is no one can find me on the internet. 🤷🏿‍♂️; But, why does my dad hate me?"

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Absolutely no one. However, it turns out to bad a fantastic business, especially in the current environment. 

Heard [this](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2kkZmuO6uMy6bCF5vydzhZ?si=5ON8JsfiTGOuORcIeuS69A) breakdown of NMIH and I've become obsessed. Trading extremely cheap for one, and generating a ton of cash for two.

What really caught my ear wax the [combined ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/combinedratio.asp), which is a measure of underwriting profitability. 100 is neutral, not making or losing money. Lower numbers equal more profitable. 

Progressive has a combined ratio around 90.

Kinsale, one of my favorite longs, is around 77-78.

NMIH is around 28.

That's obscene. They're making about 72% margins on underwriting. Plus they get to monetize their float. 

Well worth a listen if you have an hour.; Thinking of building a position in GOOGL and holding long term. Also selling calls along the way for a bit of premium once I have enough shares. At a PE of 22 I cannot see it going much lower than this but what do I know 🤷‍♂️; $IESC

""Looking forward to fiscal 2025, we expect our Communications, Infrastructure Solutions and Commercial & Industrial operating segments to benefit from continued strong demand, particularly in our data center end markets. In addition, we see opportunities to provide all of our operating segments with additional capital to drive further organic growth. Within our Residential segment, we remain cautious about near-term single-family housing demand due to housing affordability challenges and the potential that some buyers may delay home purchases in anticipation of lower mortgage rates over the next year. Nevertheless, we expect to continue to grow our Residential business through further expansion of our plumbing and HVAC services, and we remain optimistic about long-term demand in the housing market.”; Just saw somebody on Yahoo news pitching NVDA, AMZN and MSFT , the anchor then asks him “why not just buy the index?” To which the guest says “Concentration risk in big tech”.; But better buy some call options on margin incase nuclear war breaks out over the weekend and stock market goes +50% on Monday.; Casey's General Stores just hit a new ATH.  It's not just Wal-Mart and Costco eating up the rest of brink & mortar retail.

Government anti-trust hanging over them still, but they are cheapest they have in a decade atm < 17 fwd pe atm; Bit more downside for Google on Monday morning should make for a very much buyable dip.

I may say a lot of wrong things or speak in sadness on a certain stock, but the thing that I was pretty confident on here is that you were going to have to 3 day rule things here with the fact it was being hammered like it reported earnings that were ""just off"" from what was preferred.

I'm amazed I've pulled back to back great days overall. I absolutely made the right decision to sell 100 shares there.; With MSTR I honestly am having a hard time telling apart what might be investor optimism in its BTC strategy and what is a retail frenzy feeing a short term trade loop by bigger players like the meme stocks back in early 2021.; Decent Europe day so far, I have stocked up on a lot more adyen recently.


Nbis sold puts doing really well will close soon, whoever bought those got slammed; Amazing to see people unironically writing the same comments as my shitposts about IONQ/RKLB. Though I think my nonsensical back of the envelope, $1T TAM, 70% margin, 40% market share calculations are the most quantitative DD I've seen on either of these companies. Now to these investor's credit, right now they're all raking in money (unless these are high schoolers using their $500 in allowance). Making money is more important than doing it in a dignified manner. Just don't think this will persist for much longer before gravity sets in. Very interested to see where it all goes in 1 year.; TPL in the S&P 500.; SCHD is finally starting to go up a little, probably will go up even more when the interest rate go down...; LVMH is up today but still near its 52 week low anyone else buying? 

What caused it to tank so much?; What do you do when your shorts are massively underwater? you update your rating to be even more wrong to convince some bigger loser to try short and take your place 

>""BofA Securities Trims Mobileye Global Price Target to $12 From $13""

Up 38% above $13, they want us to think its up 50% from their price target? LOL idiots.; What’s going on with $LUNR? $15.34 atm.; No one cares, but I added heavily to my EOSE position this week after my buy signal triggered (taking out the 2.10 daily equals then going back above it very quickly). Added a bunch at 2.13 then more at 2.31 and trimmed the extra shares at 2.61 today.

ATAI also triggered a buy signal for me this morning, but wasnt paying attention and didnt enter until 1.52. Got out at 1.67 and have a buy order at 1.58 but it dropped to 1.59 and hasnt triggered yet.

Had a couple rough weeks with EOSE pooping the bed but got a 14% return this week to bring me back above 50% YTD performance.; $SOFI - what a comeback this earnings season has been . Institutions loading and retail selling after bag holding forever 

This is stock is primed, no more student loan moratoriums and the potential for fed back loans going out the window , is even more bullish 

The deals they signed with all the sports networks are causing them to acquire millions of members a year 

We are primed for this to be the next blockbuster stock; It's kind of funny stock to want to buy, but RL is actually pretty interesting right now based off the valuation. It's actually performed pretty well this year and the valuation isn't anything too crazy. 

PEG is at 1.79, PE is at 20, forward PE of 16. Solid ROI of 15% and great gross margins for a retailer at 64%. 

I wonder if they will get a boost from this black friday as well. Not sure if it's a company I would buy, but find it awesome that you can find value and performance in a company like Ralph Lauren.; Catching myself from two sides thinking how boring it is that I have to wait until next year to sell CRWD for long term trade, and that I am hate watching Celsius trying to post-hoc justify that it was a good idea to sell. This past month has been an addiction with all the short trade opportunities, and I needa hop off the withdrawal.; Cam we change Fridays to bubble Fridays instead of fundamentals Fridays.

It's 2024. Fundamentals don't mean dick all; Are you not entertained; KNSL approaching $500 again. Glad I loaded up in that earnings dip.; I knew bell labs was crazy in terms of how important they were, but man, watching a documentary on it, it's so crazy what they accomplished.; Managed to close out my NBIS 17.50p @ 0.60, sold last week for $2.15, 70% profit is good enough to close early for me. NBIS is actually really interesting though, wouldnt have minded getting assigned at $15 or so; How did hell did $APP overtake $TTD?; It's so annoying buying Bitcoin *after* the election would have hugely paid off.; VSH - Vishay Intertechnology

Semiconductor company with awesome bullish setup right now. Dumped 1/4 of my net worth in this morning. Let’s ride gentlemen.

Highly specialized semis that are in high demand by automotive industrial telecom consumer power military aerospace and medical markets.

This is the one gents. Yah!; Interesting bets on the day (got the information from someone else):

* MBLY - January 25 Call, $21 strike, $518,000 premium
* UAA - December 27 Call, $8 strike, $2,200,000 premium; Im going to finally take the plunge and buy QUBT and IONQ today, they are on a massive momentum. Hoping for a 20-40% gain. Im going to be rich today. They do 20-40% per day.; Maybe I got very lucky and market is bloated - but I feel like the best stocks are those which never get talked about.

I am up \~40-50% on TKO, ISRG and LEU, and up 300% on IONQ - all in last \~6 months. They do get mentioned but rarely and only after green days.

AAgain - maybe the market is too bloated and everything is up. But SP 500 is not up as much is same time period. So they are outperforming the market as of now.; $PYPL is still one of the strongest fundamentally. 

Enterprise value is sitting at market cap \~$84B

Forward PE = 17

Growing GM from 38 in 2023 to 41 as of last Q3'2024

I expect a bank run sometime in the next 2 years.; Goldman Sachs initiated EME(Emcor) as a Sell rating. That’s an interesting one. Not that analyst ratings matter; Bought the dip on PDD; I'm looking for some good beaten down stocks that make money to sell puts on, ALA PYPL at $60.  Who's got ideas?

Is it worth is to buy the dip and hold; [removed]; So close to a 100% gain in one of my accounts, it's been teasing me for the past month, hovering in the 91-95% range. Hopefully by the end of the year I hit it.; SNOW up 32% yesterday, and not even pulling back or taking profits today. Flat is good, after a day like yesterday.

Monday the rocket ride continues.; ACHR BULL RUSH🚀🚀 buy buy; Who is ready for another 30% day from QUBT and 10% day from IONQ on monday? I didn't close my positions. Already up 30% today. Expecting another 20-40% on Monday.

New comer cava, and rrdt killing it.


I'm very long the market. I think 2025 will be another good year for the bulls.; I just got rich today from qubt. I told u guys this morning. I yolod and now up 32% !!! Go reread my comment from this morning. Never does  less than 20-40% a day.  
Investing is so easy in this environment; Bought a couple lotto tickets today, makes about as much sense as the stock market to me.

Two companies I have invested in made more money than most 3rd world countries over the last quarter and are dropping in price.

One because investors are mad that the company is spending money while making more than most 3rd world countries, the other because it is just to big and would have to make more money than France to impress anyone, anymore.

I actually read an article ""downgrading"" the second because, and I quote ""sales will begin to slow down in 2026"".

Actually the lottery makes more sense.; B uy the dip never fails.; A lot of bull posts getting down-voted.

Y'all think we get a santa rally this year?; I have a budget of 5k. I want to dca that in different stocks the next 4 weeks. I’m planning to dca monthly the next 3 years. What stocks do you guys recommend to invest in?; Anyone else here have a position in HNST? I’m surprisingly up over 100% on this.; NFLX with a new ATH. Wonder if they split next year or so.; Got baba calls to swing the weekend; Kinda crazy but  TSLA is not too far from its previous ATH. It most likely will out take the previous ATH.; I have hedged my long positions in big tech with long positions in stonks like space stonks and quantum stonks. They seem to move in opposite directions. Any guesses as to why thats the case? Maybe just rotation from google money going into stonks?; Better long term future google or celh?; I feel like shorting MSTR at this price point is free money; You don't feel like mortgage insurance has a lot of systemic risk right now? I feel like there's something missing here on the risk side as to why their underwriting margins are so high but I'm not informed enough to pick it out.; Isn’t the big fear the Republicans regulating the hell out of Google?; I'm so mad I passed on buying that at $60-70.; I own AMZN, GOOG, and META but my concern isnt concentration in tech its valuation of NVDA, AAPL, and MSFT; Maybe they meant concentration risk in *other* tech companies they don't want like Apple, META, Google, Tesla, etc. I don't know I'm being charitable; LMAO. Pretty much sums up this market; It's going to go up no matter what happens. Monday of Thanksgiving week = free money meltup.; MUSA is so boring I often forget I own it and that's it's up a ton. You never hear about it, it just chugs higher and continues to shrink their share count. Oh yeah, it's beaten 5/7 of the magnificent 7 over the last 5 years.; I always like your posts. 
Boring as hell companies with steady growth…just like Lynch did back then. With all that big tech and +xxx% gains on certain stocks, you forget what investing really is or was.; Same actually, but I've been holding CROX since October 2023...; I'm watching it very closely. What are chances it drops to 150 lol; bitcoin is a scam. If I cant even buy anything with it, what use does it have. Why do we even need this? is it solving a problem?; It's definitely gotten into the ""greater fool"" part of the hype cycle so I'd be looking for exits and eventually considering shorts personally.; The rocket lab stuff is so interesting. Like it's been my lotto ticket stock for years. Stoked to see it go up so much, but no way would buy it at it's current valuation. 

Kind of lowkey hate how it's become a meme, but it's one the stock I told myself I would never sale.; Market is undervalued and every day we wake up we realize and buy higher. Ionq will probably be $50 by end of year.; I quit waiting for a dip and have been buying.; Schd is a great diversifying holding for people who are loaded up on mag 7; Decrease in Chinese consumers and also a general sales decline in brands like LV and Dior. I don't own any shares but overall I think there's still steady demand in the long term, just not at the pace it was when China's economy was stronger. I see it trading sideways for quite a bit. They're also buying Paris FC and starting a global partnership with Formula 1 next year which is kinda interesting; I think it's a worthwhile place to look for entries.; It always seems crazy to me to think that banks are doing anything with price targets other than trying to trick people into doing what they want for their own positions. If they know what's going to happen, they're going to use that info for themselves, not share it. (I think we're saying the same thing?); Bruh u calling out companies for rich valuation but go heavy in eose?; Hey I’m a long time holder, haven’t tried trading it yet. More of a “lottery ticket” play. Could be zero or $20/share. I have just under 12,000 shares; Have you read the short reports on them? Not bothered at all by them? They sounds very dodgy to me, I had them down as the NKLA of the battery space.

Also seems a massive contradiction how you’re frequently saying how the market is massively overvalued. The valuation metrics of this company are atrocious.; Do you have concerns about the next administration rolling back funding/loans that EOSE has received? Or reducing their potential business (less solar and wind)? I'm unsure about solar in the short-term (hence why I exited NXT and FSLR about a month ago); long-term is a different story. I would've thought that grid-scale batteries would have similar concerns?; how confident would you say you are with this?; yawn; Retail is so hard. You're in....then you're out. 

Just of note from other apparel names I've looked at: holiday sales are priced in. The market knows this is their best quarter. It's only if they overachieve on that overachievement that helps. 

That said, they are reducing both debt and share count, which is nice. Probably one of the more enduring brands out there right now. Not my market, but they seem to be steady. 

Also, just my pet theory....blue collar employment will slowly edge out white collar employment. Might be a headwind for RL since I would imagine they're big in business casual.; I'd like them to be named pump-it fridays. Love it. I feel like Icarus.; They haven't mattered since 2022 and never will again.; I lived near the site and have meet some  old timers.  Great stories. The one I remember that gave him an indication they were doomed was when Avaya was spun-off from Lucent. Avaya started buying competitive routers and network equipment just to function - they did not even use their own equipment.; Which documentary? Idea labs?; [Starting valuations made no sense](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1en1kf3/rstocks_daily_discussion_options_trading_thursday/lh5zgoi/). Today? No clue which is right, hence my reduced position now.; How is that annoying?   If something pays off, why be annoyed how or when it paid off?; To each their own, but I would be careful with some of those markets. Auto and industrial have been basically n bear markets for like at least a year and no bottom really insight. 

Even on VSH last earnings presentation: 

[https://ir.vishay.com/static-files/e6536ed3-25f4-401c-86b8-26900ee4e897](https://ir.vishay.com/static-files/e6536ed3-25f4-401c-86b8-26900ee4e897)

Go to slide 3. 

Industrial is down 18% YoY, auto is down 12% YoY, and other which is looks to be AI computer is down 32% YoY. 

I do own some names in the aerospace/defense, which is a pretty strong market right now. They aren't semi plays, but more around optical and components, like $DRS and $MPTI. 

The other thing is that the aerospace only makes up like 8% of their total revenue compared to auto and industrial is like 72% of their business.; MBLY is really depended on politics... good luck on that :); I posted about IONQ months back and everyone said it burns cash. Now I am up 300% - never thought I would see such numbers lol.

I am not selling for decade since that is what I decided on when I bought it. But I feel like it is bloated now - partly because of your comment lmao.; Lol; I own 3 stocks that are never talked here that all hit new 52 week highs this week.  Deere & Co, Kinder Morgan, and AT&T.  All 3 are in different market sectors and are non-tech.

Edit that to 4 as Armstrong World $AWI just hit a new 52 week high this morning.; Check out FOUR.  

No whimpering here.; Many individual stocks will outperform the market, that's the nature of them, but they are usually also riskier. That said, I'm in IONQ too.; Was a great deal under $60. At today's prices, I would be more careful.; Trump trade continues. PLTR up as well.; Brad Gerstner sold all his UBER to buy TSLA; Based on what?   (I’m not saying you’re wrong - just surprised you went to “bank run” vs just way over-priced right now); The fed and the government will do ANYTHING to prevent HTM assets from having to be sold on the open market. That will cuase a disaster making 2008 look like a fucking picnic at the park on a nice sunny day with cardinals and blue jays singing; Saw that, not sure why, but the stock has had such a solid run. 

The IESC report this morning still makes me bullish around electrical and reshoring plays.; Google on days like yesterday; Nke.  Lvmh.  Lulu.  Okta.; I would look into the semi conductor equipment names. A lot of them are great value now, but it could be a few more quarters until things look better. There is some China risk as well. 

In the chip world, autos and industrials have been slowing down for like the past year. So those markets still haven't bottomed yet, but hopefully should. So there still can be pain for a bit, but if you are looking long term, there is some great value.; Top-line Data for RETHINK-ALZ 52-week Phase 3 trial Expected Before the End of 2024


https://www.cassavasciences.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cassava-sciences-reports-q3-2024-financial-and-operating-results; The only way we will see a resurgence in offshore drilling is if crude plateaus at a much higher price than its current level. I do believe this will happen, but not due to Trump's policies or red tape cutting - it will be the shale basins rolling over in the next few years.; I trimmed some to put in Googl; Do you think they will split?; Someone has probably used it before but I just thought of it on the spot as my sarcastic retort to his dumb ""PE bro"" comment.

You know we are near the top when people are condescending and mock people who care about index wide valuations and earnings not being in touch; lol here we go; Same. Google isn't going anywhere until we get more clarity on the DOJ case. Best case scenario it keeps dropping and we can gobble up shares around $140-$150.; PLTR is another beat down 2022 stock that has been an amazing ride in 2024.; Unfortunately, you cannot consistently have 80% of market gains driven by PE expansion instead of earnings growth.

SPY EPS is now low single digit % ahead of Q4 2021 and SPY is 30% higher.

Enjoy the gains while they last, PE can sadly not inflate to infinity (well, maybe it can, who knows); Also as I said, these r a hedge against big tech stocks like amzn meta googl; Good job with that one! Took an ‘L’ with it myself - had about 0.5% of port as part of my ‘bag o’ QC’ back about $0.75 or whatever but decided to consolidate into IONQ, RGTI, and QBTS.

Can’t complain though too much in the short term - those have been ripping face as well (though not quite as hard as QUBT).

Just be careful - after today’s ripper I think it might have leapfrogged both QBTS and RGTI. Not saying that means much, but it’s heady days for sure.; > I actually read an article ""downgrading"" the second because, and I quote ""sales will begin to slow down in 2026"".

Considering the expectations baked into the price, this makes sense. Said company needs to achieve 2x ROA and 64x its current EPS to be ""fair value"".; If you think the lottery makes more sense, buy lotto tickets. I'll keep buying stocks.; I'm not, but that's awesome. Congrats on making some money; I wonder what will happen when the NFL Christmas day games take down the servers again.; As long as multiples don't matter tsla has no top; Are you serious or kidding? In an actual fearful environment or bear market big tech will be down and space/quantum will be way down; That's not a hedge at all. Space and Quantum are high risk and would get pummeled in a downturn. A hedge would be looking at blue chip corporate bonds or durable consumer staples for example.; google lol; Hahaha nice one.; Trump could announce adding BTC to the US balance sheet or something like that over the weekend and MSTR could open up 30% monday.

Thats the problem with trying to short speculative bubbles or momo driven bubbles; I think there's a pretty low risk. The average credit rating of mortgage holders is close to 760. If people have jobs, they pay their mortgage. 

I do think there are some recent homebuyers that are banking on refinancing and may not get it, but will they default? Probably not. If they're not underwater they can easily sell of needed. 

Mortgage insurance is sort of a pain because you pay a premium to protect the lender from default. Unless there's a mass of defaults, it's a great business.; The same Republicans who claim they are anti regulation?; Republicans are fucking stupid people. 


Their beef with Google is not the business, it is their stupid persecution complex which their awful media landscape reinforces daily. 


Negative articles are written about Republicans because they keep doing fucking reprehensible shit. That those articles are visible in search pages is not something which can be regulated. ; I mean it's the Biden DOJ trying to break them up, I actually feel like Trump might pull back on that push.; i cant imagine it'd be much worse than the current administration out of national interest; It happens. You’ve also made some great buys along the way. 

I want to say when I asked about this company a few years ago, you were the only person to even engage with the post. ; MSFT has barely done shit all year. I’m not concerned about MSFT at all (famous last words); What's wrong with MSFT?; Yes you are right, I just found it funny; Can you explain more? Why Monday of Thanksgiving week?; \*\*\*\* the gag seven.  Well, except NVIDIA.  Yeah that one.. but the rest.... sit...

Oh and maybe Tesla.  Is it mag seven?  Why I aint know no more...; I think I remember being in with you at one point, I have been in and out a few times trying to swing it; You can definitely buy a lot of things with bitcoin.; You can't buy anything with a block of gold, why do people buy that?; The point of bitcoin, which I believe everyone knows whether they admit to it or not, is for the price of bitcoin to go up so they get richer. 

Any other story or reason given is only to get the price to go up.; We just gon’ gloss over Silk Road? Lmaooo; What makes you think you can't buy anything with it? BTC has been an accepted payment for over 10 years; What problem does an expensive painting solve? Just because crypto can’t be used in the sense that you want to doesn’t mean other people won’t gladly overpay for it if they feel it has value. Just because I think the Mona Lisa is stupid and worthless doesn’t mean other people do. I think there is a balance point somewhere. I just don’t know how to find it.; DJT will start taking payments in Bitcoin ;); That's my instinct too, this value is intrinsically tied to BTC and that has a natural (in so far as one can consider it ""natural"") boom-bust cycle of value and hype that seeing this dip down seems like a no brainer.

What gives me pause is that BTC  when it booms can either peak for just a day or two, or it can hang out for a awhile before dropping (late 2021 compared to early 2021), this last price ""peak)"" (BTC holding steady at around 60,000) lasted from March to October and instead of droping, only rose more this time.

With the incoming administration being more crypto friendly (theoretically), I could see a case for this hype cycle artificially lasting longer than folks might thinks.; I've been tempted to sell and try to buy back in after a pullback, but who knows when that'll happen and to what extent.

I'm just going to keep holding and consider averaging up eventually when it cools down. My initial cost basis is small anyways; It had a huge pullback last year. 

There's zero chance I'm buying at current valuations.; loaded on semis so this also works for me :); 100%; Big difference between a microcap that is essentially pre revenue and a multi billion dollar company trading at nosebleed valuations. We have good estimates on what aCOST or PLTR is gonna do 12 to 24 mo ths out. EOSE has major uncertainty and that's priced in.

If EOSE even does 50% of 2026 expectations, it's a steal at today's valuation. If they don't, then it's very overpriced. Risk reward at this level is excellent if you follow the industry.  

Also, I trade it and constantly go down to 0 shares or up to 30k based on sentiment and TA.; The short reports on them are a joke. Iceberg is a terrible short book and people on Twitter literally predicted the short report the day before it came out because of massive short term put sweeps lol. I sold the morning before the short report and bought after ut was down 15%. Thank you iceberg!

I said it below, but you don't value eose on 2024 numbers, you value on 25 or 26 numbers and apply a steep discount based on execution risk. My numbers have eose as over 15 a share in 26 as my base case. Obviously I'm very bullish on them and not pricing in nearly as much execution risk as the market.; I do hVe some co cerns for sure, not gonna lie.

But at thr end of the day, the writing is on the wall and green energy plus batteries to smoothen out supply is the most cost effective option in the medium and long term. The market is already sniffing that out and states like Texas have been going big into solar and wind.

Eose is also pretty much 100% American made which is a good thing for trumps presidency, while tsla energy storage is sourced from China. 

The IRA has been a big win for many US blue collar states which all went to Trump so I can't imagine a full repeal of the IRA and the tax credits are all for made in USA stuff so I doubt they get cut.

But it's still a concern that did make me trim my position post election (plus being worried about earnings and just general profit taking); I'm actually a fan of their RRL line, it's really pricey, but the jeans are solid. I'm a denim nerd. Agree, I try to avoid retail, but kind of like $LRN, if the value is there for the stock, I'm really not opposed to it. 

It's actually down like 5% from it's peak in from a week ago. Still not sure if it's something I would own, but just love calling out stuff like this. It's had a solid year and even beating the SPY a tiny amount from the 5 year mark.; Sure as fuck feels that way but you know they will matter sometime soon; We can't share youtube links here, but it's a channel I like called S3.

I'm planning to sell soon personally. Just hit the +50% mark in unrealized gains, but business is too unpredictable to justify a ton more multiple expansion.; Those numbers are based on today's stock price. Not to mention PYPL is a cash flow growth engine 14% CAGR in last 5 years. [https://www.alphaspread.com/security/nasdaq/pypl/financials/cash-flow-statement/free-cash-flow](https://www.alphaspread.com/security/nasdaq/pypl/financials/cash-flow-statement/free-cash-flow); I'm sure this will end well; I've gone over their balance sheet, not just what's presented in the earnings calls or 10-Qs, and they are on the edge of insolvency. The unrealized losses on BofA's bond portfolio are so high, it's almost half of their tangible equity (and growing as the 10-year yield keeps rising). They cannot cover these mark-to-market losses without ruining shareholder equity. As they bought the majority of this portfolio back in 2020 when yields were 1%, it has forced them to offer almost nothing on their savings and checking accounts. All of this neglects to include their exposure to CRE, C&I, and consumer default.; They will try, even though the FDIC has nowhere near enough funding to cover the unrealized losses across the banking sector. However, an event like this will crash stock prices. That's where prepared investors can make serious money.; Yeah you really nailed the whole thesis. Impressive. 

 Emcor is selling off due to the sell rating from GS it looks like. I’ll look to be a buyer if the sell off continues in a meaningful way; I sold some of my QQQ and bought google at 5% down.. I feel like google can't really drop much more.. Didn't pay off yet, but i'm hopeful.; And today again; Nah they don't care about that; Absolutely. This shit is relentless though, my puts are suffering.; Another PE bro, who doesn't understand market dynamics.

Do I think we have another 20+ year? No, but I think we have see SPY gain 5-10% next year. I think Mag 7 continues to kill it. Think TGT, and CROX which got beat by most recent ER does well next year.; Lol 

My post was meant to be somewhat humorous, I know that I don't know anything.

The lottery is a tax on those who are bad at math, but I don't understand the stock market at all. 

People hate electric cars, auto makers have been scaling back on design and production, and yet Tesla is up 61% simply because his orange buddy won an election, show me the math and science to that.; Isn't it being produced by NFL network. They are just hosting it on their platform. Also it pumped all week so that will be a good thing.; Nothing has a top; These quantum computer stocks are gonna have a 50% red week any time soon. Nowhere close to being monetized and I mean NOWHERE close.

Doubt we see real applications in QC for decades. The more toy scale, it gets exponentially harder as that's kinda how things work in quantum space.

Kinda wish I was still I  contact with my professors to see their thoughts on the space but it is what it is.; I reckon you're right it sounds crazier than a donkey high on moon-shine!; Yeah but that will never happen, it’s always a cycle with bitcoin, goes up then down. It went up a lot recently and the downside is much bigger than the upside. I will be opening a short position on MSGR when the market opens again.; What if the job market seriously deteriorates, say interest rates stay up and companies accelerate shedding jobs for automation/AI and the new admin follows through on the promises to RIF government workers en masse.

If I had a dollar for every stock I've missed....I probably would have to own stocks anymore.; The fact it hasnt done anything in a strong year is the concern... AMZN in the past ran than was flat for years so if you held you made nothing; Too expensive for the growth imo; Most Mondays it goes up and add in a holiday week with lower volume= UP.; Honestly I think one of the big uses for bitcoin is for large organizations and state level actors to be able to move funds around and avoid a lot of scrutiny and sanctions. In that respect it's actually a pretty great vehicle as long as it keeps it's value.; Some lunatic just paid $4 million for a banana duct taped to a canvas.  He plans to eat the banana.  No shit.; I guess my question would be, what will trump do for them that isn't already available that would make bitcoin more valuable? Like what are they so excited about exactly?; Yeah, i'm at like 3.30 cost basis. I'm not even trying to time anything or worry about personally. I told myself, just I'm never going to sale, this is my ""I bought Apple"" back in the 80/90s stock. If I lose it all, whatever, but I'm hoping that I can retire off it in the future.; I sold half for this reason.; I missed the pullback. I quit buying at $1100. I’m up a good deal, and you must be up insanely.; Yup; I'm fairly sure eose has no chance competing against lithium ion; Good that you’re aware of them.

Will check it out.; If you follow your link an switch between TTM and Annual you get a much different picture. What's up with those calculations?

Anyway, atm I'm mostly worried about competitors. Adyen, Square and Strip are all trying to get a piece of the (growing) pie. Userbase is also not really growing; ""PLTR TSLA MSTR NVDA may be the best portfolio in the history of investing""

is a word for word tweet on my twitter feed that has thousands of likes and comments....

This is going to end SPECTACULARLY; Did they not take advantage of the FED buying bonds at par during the SVB crisis?; I've never been a believer in holding big bank stocks long term because they are in such a highly regulated industry and I think most people here know that. However, what are the actual chances of these losses being realized in some way? What would cause these HTM bonds that are losing value to go into the open market? The Fed has to know that risk and it doesn't seem like investors currently care too much about it.; They'll just create a new and steroided up version of the BTFP and send spy to 1000; Seems like the downgrade is related to the residential stuff, which IESC also saw slowness. Makes sense, housing starts have come down and rates going up again will slow some construction. 

I'll have to double check to see what their exposure to residential even is.; dont enter puts until trump takes office IMO.

all the jobs and economic data has been cooked with outlier level positive seasonal adjustments. Those HAVE TO BE BALANCED by outlier level negative seasonal adjustments, and those will show a more true state of retail sales and job numbers.

FYI, that september blowout jobs report with the 220k job gains had the highest september seasonal adjustment factor ever. If you used the sept average adjustment over the past 20 years..... the report was a 200k job LOSS instead of gain.

Just wait imo; Another bubble bro who doesnt care about earnings or the fact that in the long run the market is driven by earnings.

SPY is up 30% on around 4% EPS growth in the last 3 years. And in the 10 years before that, majority of the growth was also driven by PE expansion. 

In the short term, valuations dont matter. In the medium and long term they do. Everyones a genius in a bull market, even you.; Math requires using logic. It makes logical sense that the allies of people in power will gain more power once the transition happens. I personally try to avoid political arguments to my investing but if you can logically figure out why price movement happened, even if it is a little political, that is as much math as any numbers would be; But NFLX is providing the stream which they don't have the server capacity to handle the large audience, as evidenced by both the Tyson fight and and Love is Blind fiascos.; Same as nuclear ya; If you think that leads to lots of mortgage defaults, it would be bad for the company. 

However, of note. According to the presentation, if there were to be a 2008 style housing crash, their combined ratio would drop to 92. So, still profitable at least.; How do you usually take advantage of this knowledge?; I didn't buy because I had issues with management. I'd be up about 200% if I had. Oh well.; I'm VERY sure you haven't done your research then :); the report has factually incorrect information all over the place. It also has a lot of speculation that MAY be true, but theres nothing concrete.

For example, they talk about Cerberus being loan sharks and how multiple companies they have owned have been destroyed. Those companies A, have a very different business model (a hopsital chain was their comp lmao) and B are owned by a different branch of Cereberus.

They act like CRB is trying to bankrupt EOSE and own the equity, when thats blatantly not true. In fact the ER 2 weeks ago showed EOSE missed a debt covenant, and cerebrus VOLUNTARILY WAIVED THE PENALTY for EOSE, indicating they are legit partners.

Theres more in it too that was BS. And to add to that, Icebern closed their puts right after the short report and closed their short. If they had conviction they should not just close their short immediately after the report. It was simply a smash and grab on a stock with >70 RSI that was overbought.; Of course it will. It always does. Risk reward is already way skewed to the downside. Insider selling at massive paces as retail inflow hits all time highs.

I think the following 2 sayings are the MOST important things to remember right now:

1: The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

2: Tops are a process. Bottoms are a moment.

This is a PROCESS for sure ;); Np!

204,Investing in What You Know: Modern Tools for Finding Hidden Gems,"In 'One Up On Wall Street' (great book, highly recommend) Peter Lynch emphasizes the idea of ""investing in what you know"". Specifically, he talks about how some of his best investing ideas initially came from a friend or family member raving about a particular product:

>*""Taco Bell, I was impressed with the burrito on a trip to California; La Quinta Motor Inns, somebody at the rival Holiday Inn told me about it; Volvo, my family and friends drive this car; Apple Computer, my kids had one at home and then the systems manager bought several for the office; Service Corporation International, a Fidelity electronics analyst (who had nothing to do with funeral homes, so this wasn’t his field) found on a trip to Texas; Dunkin’ Donuts, I loved the coffee; and recently the revamped Pier 1 Imports, recommended by my wife. In fact, Carolyn is one of my best sources. She’s the one who discovered L’eggs.”*

According to Lynch, this is the key advantage retail investors have over Wall Street: spotting great products and brands in their daily lives, often long before they arrive on an Investment analyst's desk.

I'm wondering whether this process can be modernised, and expanded.

One challenge I face, for instance, is that I don’t live in the U.S., so the American products I notice are often already global, and likely already on Wall Street’s radar. This limits my ability to discover the kind of early opportunities Lynch described if I want to invest in American companies. 

Same goes for brands in Asia or Africa—surely there are great companies out there, future ten-baggers, but many of us won't come across simply because we're not exposed to their products, and by the time we are we've missed the boat.

I’m curious if people know of tools or methods to help identify these hidden gems. 

Perhaps something like an online product rating site or resource for finding universally loved brands that haven’t gone mainstream yet. I’ve thought about using tools like Amazon's “top rated” section, but reviews can be manipulated, and often it's just Chinese tat you can't invest in. I also checked out r/buyitforlife, but it’s not quite what I'm after.

Thoughts?

*this is the key advantage retail investors have over Wall Street: spotting great products and brands in their daily lives, often long before they arrive on an Investment analyst's desk*

You realize analysts have daily lives too, right? He wasn't some random solo investor when he was running with these hunches, he was working for one of the largest investment companies in the world.

If you bothered to read the book rather than be a little know-it-all gimp on reddit he goes on to explain exactly why the big investment houses are often unable to invest in those companies, even if their analysts are aware of them.

>He's telling about his hunches that went well. How many didn't go so well

Plenty. But far more worked out than didn't, his track record was exemplary. And his point is to use is as a jump of point rather than the entire basis for investing. 

>Comparing the world of investing from 1977-1990 to the current day is just silly. 

Some things stand the test of time. Plenty of Graham and Dodd's writing is just as valid now as it was 80 years ago. I see no reason why Lynch's wouldn't be."

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); >Bruh your post history is the saddest shit ever.

Judging by his post history he is a troll. He claims he has a degree in fiance and he has like 20 different posts showing $10,000-$50,000 losses. On top of that he seems unemployed for at least the last 2 years and he is looking for jobs at Walmart. Either he is a rich kid with access to $500,000+ to lose on the stock market or he is faking all this shit for internet points.; Bro might actually be right about being a massive loser?? Like, buddy isn't far away from actually being behind the Wendy's dumpster; I’m trying. I need help 🙁 and support before I give up on life. I do this because I’m not happy in life.; Bro right 😭😭😂😂 makes me feel better about myself; Jesus you weren't kidding that was rough; Unrelated but i find it so amusing how when someone posts something, there is always that one person that digs through past posts for some reason.

Why is that?; 10:1 odds says he comes back in a month.; I too have a chart like that; Looking at his posts about it is kinda hilarious to me. He is smug with the “up .23 overnight 🥵😮‍💨” with a screenshot showing he is up 23k+ for the day. Only to have another post 7 days later where he lost 28K and say he wants to end it and he will never learn. Multiple cases like that. Very regarded; thanks for ruining my day too... dick.; I just shit my pants you fucking asshole, thanks a lot; I stubbed my toe today.

Would not follow anyone's advice on here. Half of the DD is a clown show and is framed that way.; But also just general awareness. The guys making 600 k don’t care about a 40 k loss as much as a guy who has 1 k extra a month because they can afford to lose while the other can’t. 

Basically it’s fine if you can afford it lol; I mean if you don't have folks like him where else would that ""entertainment/drama"" value come from ? Lmao; ""These degenerates"" - excuse me, this person is 44k in the hole because reddit tempted them, THEY ARE the degenerate.; The only reason I subscribe to this sub is to remind myself to never even think about gambling in the stock market.; Check out his post history; Who sits here in the middle of a bull market like I just know apple is bound to collapse; I'd imagine op would also take full responsibility for their own decisions; the losing call at the bottom is chefs kiss; Op forgot to inverse themselves ; Put is short for put down your money; I actually don't. When I buy stocks I literally just press the buy option. I'm not OP but can you give me a tl;Dr?; Yes, it's short for ""PUT the fucking fries in the bag bro"".; Way different than the blackjack table losses - they’ll pay for your room, food, flights and treat you awesome when you lose 43K.; Nah, he should come back tomorrow.  The liquidity he provides is valuable.; When you do this at a blackjack table are you supposed to throw an epic fit blaming the dealer or the other players?; you cant lose this much on a blackjack table, unless youre op.....
nvm; Bears don’t take responsibility.  Thats how they end up being bears.; Naw bro, it's 100% YOUR fault that I gambled and loss.

If I would have gambled and WON it would have been because I'm a fucking genius...; Oh yeah fk u wsb; Typical gen Z bull shit; But people on the internet told me the wrong info.; No no. When I win, it's because I'm brilliant. When I lose, it's your fault because I'm clearly brilliant and you all just ruined it for me.

I'm not sure how you do it, but it's definitely your fault

(/s just în care); Imagine if this guy just put 40K in VOO or VTI at the beginning of the year...

I've said it before and I'll say it again. I love to gamble. 20 bucks on a football game, hell yeah. But I would never put my mortgage on a football game, And Id never bet my mortgage on a dumb options play. 

Just buy and hold shares and you'll be fine. You might lose a little bit, but you're certainly not going to lose 40K in a year if you just diversify a little bit.; He DID change it, to “idk man life is hard”; u/GetPoor-Quick; Yeah. What’re you gonna do to stop me from buying more 0dtes on his account?; This is the way!; It ain’t over until the debt collectors take my phone!; I am; Present, your Honor!; So true. My church is a community. My neighborhood is a community. This online forum is a funny place to shitpost; looks like he makes decent salary at his job, of course he’ll come back if he has nothing else to do with his money.; The fact I had to scroll so far to find this is astounding. He lost 14% in 10 months. He’s the top 1% of this sub. 

People just see the -43k and don’t even bother with anything else. It could read -43k YTD as a .01% loss and the comments would still be the same; Right? Dude's still got about $300k just in his Robinhood account. Something tells me he'll be fine.; I was wondering if I was misinterpreting something. You could literally make 14% on one good day of earning’s report. I’ve recovered from being 90%+ down, twice. 

I suspect OP is karma farming.; it’s depressing asf; Something fishy bout this profile.; I read most of his posts. Why he never put down any money into the index fund and yoloed always into options is beyond me.; Oh hey it's me.   I thought everyone here were options magnates.; this sub is the best drama I never knew I needed in my life; I bet he cares how now.; Yo I had to look back at that! Hahaha; Wait we don’t hate the devil anymore - where was my meme-o.  I’m so behind.; If only it twernt you; lol 😂; his ex is the gambling help hotline  in this case; Idk why it said 14%. I’m broke I have 0 dollars left.; He bet against them.  Derivative markets are essentially gambling on which way a stock will move.

He'd' have better odds going to Vegas and putting it all on red...; I’m trying to; Get support, relax, and for fuck sake don't buy puts on SP500.; impossible melodic chief fretful drunk roll vast squeamish run marry; Do not jump off a bridge. I used to think about it, but a new neighbor moved across the street from me and she had a 14-year-old daughter. The 14-year-old daughter did jump off a highway overpass and went smack on the ground below. Now she’s in chronic pain all the damn time. Do not jump off a bridge. Do you hear me? There’s worse things than being poor.; Id suggest you not to jump, and if you really do, tansfer me the 250k before jumping ill lose the rest for you.; You’re like those teen girls who record themselves crying. 

Fucking loser.; Seriously take this as one of the biggest wake up calls you needed in life. Stop betting, just grow your money right now. CDs and savings. Don't even touch anything in the stock market it's too close to your point of addiction. If in the future you have enough savings and you're far gone from this mess, get a wealth manager but you cannot even look at the stock market my friend.

I hope you get help, you need it in almost every area of life. Take your time with it, this isn't the end; I’ve been following you am genuinely curious how your climb back up been? Are you up these past two months?; Brother tell me you turned that $25k into $2.5M off some combo of MSTR/RKLB/ACHR. If not, just pack it in dog.; lol in the middle of the biggest bull market in years that seems to happen. Theres plenty of opportunities intraday to be bearish but a short bias in a bull market is a recipe for disaster.

Leave him alone, he's not hurting anyone; Awww, they’re having such a good time together.; Da that’s crazy he has lost easily 50k with all the money he keeps depositing.; 40k was a teacher salary 10 years ago, this is a Wendy's salary; Sadly new teachers start around 35k here still.; > a teacher salary 

That’s what we call buying lunch for the group.; Fellas I was a teacher about 3 years ago and my starting pay was 38K, AND I was doing SPED in a low income area so my salary was a bit higher than other gen-ed teachers because SPED is subsidized by Uncle Sam…or it will be until King Trump axes the Department of Ed, then I guess nobody will want to teach SPED or any other subject for that matter 🥲; If he was retired in any capacity, he's probably not now.; More like dishonorably discharged; Well, spending that much time trolling for imaginary Internet points is pretty fucking sad.....; The 45k loss here is also just 14% which means he has about 260k if it isn't fake.; If i had studied fiance a bit more it would have saved me a lot of money; Wow, that’s the way to go. No income and gamble away whatever you have. That way you know your friends and relatives don’t only like you for your money.; ""...or he is faking all this shit for internet points."" That's even more pathetic.; I guess there's something to be said for the idea that you unconsciously manifest the person your see yourself as.; your probably right, just get our of your head. Start by doing something outside, something that has no connection with dumb money. Or go study something, something that takes time but is worth it long term.; Best advice: Avoid WSB and any of this get rich quick stuff. Focus on holding down your job until you have saved up enough to switch jobs to something more fulfilling. Hang in there, I also liked your older posts where you were mapping out startup ideas. Keep it up. Just avoid gambling at all costs.; So because you are not happy in life you are probably low in dopamine/serotonin and are looking for a high and have settled on gambling. Replace that bad addiction with a ""healthy addiction"". 


An activity that gives you that same brain boost but is not damaging to yourself. Things like working out, finding a local community group that shares common interests as you, or hobbies in general.


Therapy/Counciling if that's an option available to you on the side will help guide you when you struggle to stay on your healthy path.


Good luck homie; You have like 250k left if losing 34K is only 15% down.

Withdraw all your money and start a business. Maybe something you wanted to do when you were a kid or something.; I can’t say whether you’re kidding or not, but money is just money—plenty of it or the absence of it. Life goes up and down, take a break, learn your lesson and eventually you will find something that will give you the fulfillment you’re searching for. Surround yourself with positive good people. If things get really rough either look for someone you trust to talk or use any credible hotline/chat for crisis/self-harm situations. Best of luck. God speed!; It’s good to be self aware. Make sure not to use that as an excuse to gamble more.; Go on a walk outside every day drink a gallon of water a day and pick an achievable goal that will better your short term circumstances. Find a way to stack minor W’s don’t feel like you need to fix everything all at once because that’s overwhelming. Every day is a new day you may win some you may lose some but the most important thing is a small positive slope; Stop chasing the dopamine.; See a therapist asap; https://www.ncpgambling.org

Those kind of investments are meant to be your backbone to retirement. Gamble with scraps.; $10k / year, 7% returns for 35 years (let’s say you start at 30) is $1.5 mil. Using the 4% rule, that’s $60k / year, plus social security. Assuming your house is paid off and you have no debts, it’s doable.

So many people trying to climb out of poverty don’t have enough disposable income to outpace the rising costs of existing the way our economy has been trending since 2000. Your strategy makes sense if you’re not that far off retirement now and can keep your capital in the market as you draw from it because your slice should pay you out enough as the economy grows, and in the past was 100% the prudent thing. 

But if you’re in your 30’s with even minor student debt, no home equity, and you haven’t seen your wages rise with inflation working a normal job (which you were also told to be the prudent thing to get), it really limits the odds that a strategy based on trusting the market at large to give you enough to live on in your twilight years given the amount of time between now and then is feasible.

I like to critically think and what I enjoy about this community is parsing all the bullshit with genuinely solid DD mixed in with silly shit, because it proves good ideas can come from everywhere if you know how to listen. But I also think that there’s a lot of sadness on this subreddit because people are mixing with degenerate gamblers (and sometimes becoming them) because they think a calculated risk is a worthy gamble when we’re all being slowly crushed by the rich and they feel the need to do something to get out of the pressure cooker. It’s similar to rising poverty=rising crime, because at a certain point the reward outweighs the risk.; $500k can only support about $20k/year in retirement income.

209,My mother asked me if I can help her with investing,"Im 20 years old and have been learning about investing for a solid 2-3 years now. My mother (37) sees and appreciates the work i’ve been putting in and asked me today for advice. 

“Should I invest with the bank or would you want to help me?”

I told her i’d help her. She doesn’t like much risk in any areas of her life so i’m thinking on focusing her portfolio on ETFs (VOO, SCHD) or simply just the S&P 500. 

Also thought about dividend paying companies (KO, O) or large caps like AAPL, MFST etc. 

Considering the bull market, a lot of non investors have been getting excited about the market recently. We’re at/near market ATH so I feel like I should tell her to hold off for a bit and wait for a dip but you can never time the market. 

What are your thoughts? Any advice would be much appreciated. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gw7a66/my_mother_asked_me_if_i_can_help_her_with/,15,2024-11-21 04:54:26,"Buy her a copy of Simple Path to Wealth - and stay away from picking stocks for her.  If things go wrong, she needs to have made the decisions.; Zoom out for 30 years for the S&P500 and look at how many times the market has been at an all-time high, and how much bigger the all-time high was after 30 years.  

Trying to time the market is always dumb but it's particularly dumb when you're 37 and saving for retirement, because it literally doesn't matter as you can rest assured the market will have increased in 30 years, unless the world experiences some apocalyptic cataclysm we can't imagine.

At a minimum she should be maxing her IRA every year if possible, and she can just use a simple target date fund because IRAs are tax efficient so holding a fund that includes some bonds on it doesn't matter.

VOO is a good choice for a non-tax-advantaged account, although I'd rather have a whole stock market index fund like VTI.; Try also to teach her about market volatility. In case she checks her investments and panic sells or simply don't trust the process because she sees losses.

Because it will come years where the market is down **by a lot.**

I like using a [historical investment calculator](https://www.chooseinvesting.com/calc/historical-index-returns/) but even this won't highlight how bad it can actually be, only that the process will probably work given enough time.

And good you teach her instead of letting the banks picks investments for you because they will likely not choose a index fund that is probably the best long-term investment for most people.; At her young age (and yours), keep it simple 1) open an IRA/ROTH account at Fidelity, Schwab, or Vanguard, 2) put all the money into the highest date Target Date Fund offered and 3) add as much as budget and law allows every year and retire well off.; I'd personally dollar cost average into a low cost index fund like VOO (or SPLG if she can't buy partial shares/likes buying whole shares). With her time horizon SCHD doesn't make sense to me. Then flip to dividends in retirement. 

*This is just my two cents, not financial advice, all obvious disclaimers apply.; If your mother is risk adverse, then 100% stocks may not be appropriate. I would forget about investing in individual stocks also as that brings on even more risk. 

A globally diversified all cap exposed portfolio combined with a healthy bond allocation would be considered more moderate risk. Look into VT + BND or VTI + VXUS + BND. Better yet for a more hands off approach you could use a TDF in a tax advantaged account or one of Vanguard’s LifeStrategy funds if investing in a taxable account.; SPLG would be a great ETF for her.

You should not be heavily dividend investing at such a young age. You're leaving so much money on the sidelines when large cap growth is your best friend.; Time in the market beats timing the market. DCA’ing into an ETF is a fantastic strategy.; > She doesn’t like much risk in any areas of her life so i’m thinking on focusing her portfolio on ETFs

""I need a new car.  I'm thinking of focusing on Fords.""  Limiting your search to Fords does not address how safe a car is, or how easy it is to mount child seats, or give thought to its IIHS rating, or its gas mileage (""expense ratio""), or whether it can tow your trailer; you need to go deeper.

Likewise, simply being ""in ETFs"" does not make your investments ""low-risk"".  There are MANY indices, and even more FUNDS that track those indices, and passively managed funds have just as much volatility as the indexes that they follow.

You need to drill deeper to figure out what a ""not much risk"" portfolio really is.  (And putting all your investments in ONE SECTOR of the markets, ignoring Mid-Caps, ignoring Small-Caps, ignoring Vallue *vs.* Growth, ignoring International, ignoring Emerging Markets, ignoring bonds, isn't -my- definition of ""not much risk"".  Your opinion may be different.); blah blah blah. Put your mother into index funds. She is 37 and has long horizon.  Auto pilot. 

What do you know about all time highs and market dips at 20 ?  

What are you doing with your own money ?; I’m being blunt (sorry for that), but 1) you don’t even seem to know the basics about asset allocation and 2) you think that investing in stocks ETFs is for people that don’t like much risk, and 3) you’re asking for advice on reddit. 

You shouldn’t handle someone else’s money.

Google If You Can by William Bernstein and read it. It’s short and free.

If your mom is risk averse, you can use AOM, a moderate risk asset allocation ETF. It holds 40% bonds.; Dividends can be useful when someone needs more cash inflow. But your mother likely wants Reinvested Dividends (DRIP), not just the additional cash earnings. The dividends can be supplemental income, stashed towards other investment purchases, or let it automatically roll back into the same original investment kicking it out. That's instead of hoping for only share price growth. ; She can always hedge her bet by putting in 50% of her investments funds in now, and wait to see if there is a substantial drop.

If the market goes up, she’ll be happy with the gains, if it goes down, she can grab some bargains 😃; Well there are great ways to make far better then the market returns you referring to with these funds you mention. And I assume you going to suggest she buy and hold those holding as well. And don’t forget those dividend paying stocks that you’re the one that is paying yourself the dividend. I understand I have some great stocks that pay dividends. Wish they would not. It just makes a tax evened for me that I would rather control. NVDA pay a dividend, why. So on the day the dividend is paid my stocks value goes down by the exact amount of the dividend.; So many variables are missing. Is the investment in an IRA/Roth?  Brokerage account?  401K?

Does she have an emergency fund or access to a HELOC?

Dividends are taxed as income, as are short term capital gains... but long term capital gains can be tax gain harvested based on her income.

Depending on income, I would start with an IRA at Schwab/Fidelity.. and DCA into VTI or VOO while you work out a long term plan.

Plan should start with a budget, then a savings plan.. and then a long term plan for retirement (see boldin.com); I don't know where you live, but guide her to a low cost brokerage like Schwab, where they provide free financial advice and predetermined portfolios based on her risk profile. This would be a good start.; the answer is ""no""; Create a brokerage and an IRA for her and begin investing in BLK for both. She’s young enough to be putting money into a medium to higher risk ETF. It’s the largest fund manager in the world and they have exposure to everything, so the risk management is top tier. Shares run about $1040 right now.; many older people with index funds in there portfolios.  Often hear of a market crash panic and sell most of their  Locking in the loss. It happens all the time.  So I would eliminate VOO don't focus on growth for now..  Focus on Dividend funds or stocks with yields  of around 4 to 5%.  These would provide income which you mom needs most.  If she puts as much money as she can in dividends stocks she might get enough income from dividends to cover all of her living expenses.  Also emphasize pay off all debts.  Pay off the home and all credit cards.  In retirement t you want no debt.

SCHD is a good fund consider adding JEPI, PFFD, PBDC, and VYMI.  These three are very stable and have a higher dividend than SCHD.  I also have no problem with stocks like KO,  KHC, and T.  which all have     But AAPL and MFST are fairly old companies with high shar costs and low yields and don't grow like they did 20 years ago.   So I would avoid these because they will suck up a lot of your moms money and provide little benefit to her.; If it were me I'd have her buy 90% VTI and 10% VT; My mother taught me how to invest. She showed me the basics and explained in simple terms the various risks associated with each option. However, she always insisted that I choose the stock / bond / fixed term deposit / etc..  In other words, I have to own the risk.; Ok first off, she should be maxing out her 401K, IRA, or Roth. This will reduce her tax burden. 

Now she is relatively young so she needs to consider her time horizon. Any money put into individual stocks, she needs to be comfortable with those stocks potentially being cut in a third or maybe even half. If she invests in the S&P500 she needs to be willing to hold for maybe up to 10 years. The market will make her money, but only if she sticks it out. 

Some strategies I might consider for her are dividend growth, this will be made up of companies that are growing their dividend. It shows they can manage cash flow and are growing to where they feel comfortable increasing their payout. Other than that Dollar Cost Averaging into the market is my main go to. Lastly, if you or she has expertise in an individual area/industry, consider individual stocks. You can make a lot of money if you are good at picking them and if you know your market, whatever these froobs say, you can know things the “Smart Money” misses. 

Good luck. Let make some money!; 500 index until you hit 1M.; At ATH it is OK to start and hold off not putting all money available to use. All those stocks or etfs you mention are fairly expensive. Often I look for same funds at lower price and expense ratio using Swppx for SPY etc.

With the new adminstration coming on board favoring different and often radical policies, I have followed an interest sensitive philisophy focus by sectors. SPDR has a number of sector etfs.  The finance industry thrives when borrowing rate is lower. XL**F** consists of 74 **F**inancial insitutions. The return this year is +33.65%. Alternative energy may not be a good choice.  These etfs are simpler to manage than worrying about 7 different stocks.  Also they tend to beat the S&P which uses just 7 tech stocks to drive 85% of the momentum. All the best to you.; VOO; Great that your mom trusts you! VOO, SCHD, or solid dividend stocks like KO are perfect for low-risk. Don’t stress market timing dollar-cost averaging works well. Just ensure she has an emergency fund set aside first.; I'd recommend this. Investing for a family member is getting close to doing business with family, which I also recommend against. With the wrong family member, if anything goes wrong, it'll be your fault and you'll hear about it for years. Guiding them to resources where they can make their own smart decisions is what I go with, especially given that she's risk averse.

For example, O peaked at around $80 before the pandemic. It's now around $55. Even accounting for dividends, that's terrible performance, particularly compared to how the general market has soared in that same time. Would you really want to hear about how terrible your advice was for 5+ years?; Buy VOO and Fuhgeddaboudit; Recent times have spoiled people. If you go around different investing subreddits you will read that investing 100% in VOO is a low risk portfolio or even that 20% BTC is conservative.

OP says that they’ve been learning about investing for two or three years and the equates a low risk tolerance with investing in (equity) ETFs.

If OP is going to handle someone else’s money (and they probably shouldn’t) they should at least read a basic book about investing that touches upon the topic of asset allocation."
210,$ACHR The Bull Run Hasn't Started Yet," **TLDR:** Current fair value is +$10imo, Archer is currently the leader and will likely be the first to market, Major upcoming catalysts: Factory opening by the end of next month, Initiation of manufacturing in Jan, Final FAA certification, and Trump Presidency.

 Archer Aviation ($ACHR) recently delivered a strong Q3 earnings call, highlighting significant advancements in their journey to commercialize eVTOL technology. With robust financials, strategic partnerships, New Trump Administration, and progress in FAA certification, Archer is positioning itself to outpace competitors and become the first to market in the eVTOL industry. 

# Archer Will Likely Be The First To Market

Archer Aviation ($ACHR) is likely to be the **first to market** in the eVTOL industry, even outpacing Joby Aviation. How? Their focus on **scalability and an efficient supply chain** sets them apart. They've strategically outsourced about **80% of their major components** to established **Tier 1 suppliers** who have FAA certification expertise. This traditional aerospace model **reduces development risks, speeds up the certification process, and taps into existing supply chains for faster scalability.** Basically, they're not trying to reinvent the wheel, and it's paying off big time. This approach reduces development risks, speeds up the certification process, and utilizes existing supply chains for faster scalability.

In contrast, Joby follows a vertically integrated model, designing and manufacturing most components in-house, which allows for greater control and potentially higher performance but involves higher capital costs, longer certification timelines, and scaling challenges due to the novelty of its components. This difference in strategy positions Archer for a quicker and more efficient path to market.

As **Archer tweeted on Friday**, Archer's type-design is now **matured**, and they're ready to start producing piloted aircraft as soon as their **factory opens** at the **end of this year.** These aircraft will be operational by the beginning of 2025, with plans for piloted demonstrations and market survey flights with passengers throughout the year.

# Trumps Interest in VTOLs and The New Secretary of Transportation

President Donald Trump recently announced his administration’s support for VTOL technology, recognizing its transformative potential for economic growth and national security. Adding to this momentum, among Trump's picks for Secretary of Transportation is **Emil Michael**. If appointed, he has close ties to **Archer’s Chief Commercial Officer, Nihil Goel as he tweeted on Saturday.** This relationship could facilitate smoother regulatory pathways for Archer as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) finalizes critical rules for advanced air mobility. With the **new Trump administration,** Archer is poised to **benefit** from from significant political and regulatory tailwinds that could accelerate its growth in a market projected to reach **$1 trillion by 2040**.

# Financially Strong As Mentioned in Q3 Call

As mentioned in their Q3 call, Archer ended the quarter with over **$500 million** in cash reserves(with an additional 400M unaccounted for). With a quarterly cash burn of about **$80-90 million**, this gives them a solid **18-month runway**. This strong cash position is further **strengthened** by their partnership with **Stellantis**, which has agreed to contribute up to **$400 million** to help scale the manufacturing of Archer's Midnight aircraft. This capital **will cover manufacturing labor costs and capital expenditures for initial production at their new facility in Georgia.** By outsourcing 80% of their components to established suppliers, they've managed to keep operational costs in check while accelerating production timelines.

Additionally, Archer has issued **$30 million** in performance warrants to Stellantis, which will vest upon achieving certain milestones. They also have contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense worth up to **$148 million**.

# AHCR Fair valuation +$10

 After their Q3 earnings call, Archer received many analyst upgrades ranging between $10-12 PT. While Archer is ahead of JOBY in my opinion and will enter the market first, currently there's such a significant difference in market caps between Archer and Joby.

Joby is trading at **$6.14** with a market cap of **$4.72 billion**, while **Archer Aviation (ACHR)** is at **$5.00** with a market cap of only **$2.15 billion**. If we compare apples to apples, Archer should be valued potentially around **$12**. In fact, Archer is ahead imo due to its scalability, reliance on established parts suppliers, and lower costs. Their strategy will speeds up the FAA certification process and allows for quicker scalability. On the other hand, Joby's vertically integrated model, while offering more control, comes with higher capital costs, longer certification timelines, and scaling challenges. This difference in approach positions Archer for a faster and more efficient path to market, making the current valuation gap seem unjustified.

[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse); In December, ACHR wishes to carry out the first piloted flight of the production aircraft, it will not be a prototype. The whole world will see the video.; I read the title, looking good. I'm all in; I have 100 shares. How many do I need to get rich fellas? 😎

Edit: my 300 turned into about $500 gains so far. Very happy with the flying car company.; Everyone in the comments are all on board. So that means,  buy puts; It's the dumbest mode of transportation yet but I'm sure that's why it'll moon. All in on calls.; I’ve been in Archer awhile.  It looks promising the more I’ve watched them hit their milestones. As a V-22 pilot I know that tiltrotor technology was a game changer for air travel within the DOD.  

With the efficiency of battery technology and 12 separate rotors this will be a game changer in the private sector.  Safe, reliable, quiet, fast, economical and can take off / land vertically like a helicopter then transition and fly at speeds of a traditional fix wing.

Don’t forget the big news that Archer closed a deal with Japan Airlines and Sumitomo last week. JAL and Sumitomo have agreed to purchase 100 Midnights, valued at $500 million.  This is to add onto UAE, South Korea, US Air Force, United, Southwest and Stellantis current deals.  

Near to midterm significant milestones upcoming:
-Georgia Plant construction completion (any week now)
Georgia Plant building first conforming EVTOL (Beginning of 2025)
Piloted testing in conforming aircraft (February / March 2025)
FAA Type certification (August-December 2025)
First customer commercial flight (Beginning of 2026); Since the start of the month I’ve made 2000% gains in calls. I’m all in on this stock.; Once it dips a bit, I’m in 1k shares; Sounds good, I'm 5 shares in.; 14500 shares and 97 calls deep.; Bought $1,000 worth because of this thread.  Full regardless; I'm an actual pilot of actual airplanes that run on actual fuel.

I can promise you, we are still decades away from them profitably flying anyone in anything that's fully electric. 

The FAA is one of the slowest-to-modernize agencies. Nothing changes without emergency. And electric VTOLs are a toy for the megarich, not something the the FAA is going to rewrite the FAR-AIM to allow any time soon.

Y'all can jump in for the pump and dump, but as far as this being a realistic company.... I got a bridge to sell ya.; A great writeup with the TL:DR at the top!  Incredible.  Also, I'm invested so I hope you're right.; You made the case for Joby here. Vertical integration is big brain. Outsourcing is small brain.; JOBY is vertically integrated in a high tariff future and has bulletproof tech that ACHR has been chasing. Way more IP, better balance sheet, good leadership. If I’m throwing $$$ into eVTOL space it’s going to be to JOBY until it’s too expensive. First to the market??? Let’s see but FAA is everything and JOBY is further along. ACHR might meme but shits scammy and full of delays and broken targets and promises; https://preview.redd.it/i8udalc7w22e1.jpeg?width=2960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=64c6be7a0422600a8152fc228a0e3f9c4c3ab1d4

you son of a bitch..im in; They make fucking electric helicopters; If they're outsourcing manufacturing, then won't they be negatively effected by the tariffs?; I sold calls deep itm and bought more this morning.; I wish WSB would shut the fuck up about these gems. I was loading heavy on RKLB in the $6-10 dollar range before I started seeing ""wallstreetbets next target blah blah"" headlines and now we're starting with archer?

Shut. The. Hell. Up. Let me buy before flapping your Wendy's grease covered dick huggers; 400 shares and still buying! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189); Hasn't Joby alrdy finished pre production flight as well?; Great analysis OP bought some $ACHR lets see if it will fly :); I’m in since Nov with $4 calls exp 1/17
Almost sold yesterday.. holding now that I am hearing more and more about this stock 
🚀; Shit, enemy VTOL worship ![img](emote|t5_2th52|27421)![img](emote|t5_2th52|27421)![img](emote|t5_2th52|27421)![img](emote|t5_2th52|31226)![img](emote|t5_2th52|31226)![img](emote|t5_2th52|31226); Alright, just bought 250 Jan $7 calls.; 60$ + a share in 2028 after usher arrive at the Olympic in LA in midnight; Ima cop some LEAPs. Hopefully I’ll come back to this post and thank you in a few months!; unpack long weary different apparatus smell possessive aloof bored cats; Saying JOBY's vertical integrated approach is bad is crazy, you should look into how TSLA does it, and why BA keeps getting L's.; Holding 1000 @ $4.46

Lets fucking go; Whoa, this guy was in ASTS very early too.; I already had bought 3 $4.5 calls for 1/17/25, but after reading this, I just bought 10 $9 calls for 1/17/25; How is it that the day after this story is published stock goes up 14% ? Is that because this group driving up the price?; 200 shares here at 4.80 average will buy more if it goes down some more ![img](emote|t5_2th52|29637); Can everybody just start buying?? Like today please.; Joby it's ahead in FAA regulation and already planning to do business in Abu Dhabi... Also better battery and a much more ""taxi"" Design

What's the point on Archer? Ark investment would strike warnings also damn... 

Joby is the right play; Three questions for you:

1. Why won't this go the way of Lilium?  (down the shitter)
2. Why Archer and not Joby?
3. Are we really going to have hundreds/thousands of these fucking things in the air flying people around day and night?; the fact this is getting pumped so hard on WSB makes me think this is a nothing burger stock, however i am all in ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883); Never heard of them and didn’t feel like reading all that. Just ordered my shares.; [deleted]; I bought in April calls $8 strike; 🫣💰; Thanks for the instant 10k gain. I plan to hold my leaps for one year 💪; You son of a bitch, I’m in.; Yeah, also 60% short interest
 Edit, incorrect figures, the short interest is actually 20%, with 60 millions share being shorted as of October, my bad, truly an regarded moment; I bought 4. Based on OP’s DD that should be enough to retire; Got lucky and bought 2k shares at $3.15 a month ago; Wish I bought more.  Cashed out 20 contracts +260%.  $900 cool dollar profit.  Thanks OP!; So they make personal sky taxis?  What happens when one of them crashes?; I think there is no doubt they can build the capability. But i dont get the logistics of commuter flights not ending/beginning at and airport. People are shitty drivers, but in a car a ding is a $1000 insurance claim. In a VTOL, someone is plummeting to earth from 2000 ft.     

That's not even the hurdle that worries me. So I fly my chopper from east Jersey into downtown NY. Where do i land? What do I do when 50000 other dickwads like myself are all trying to get into midtown and there is only room to land 1000 quadcopters? With cars, you can have multi-level parking. With a VTOL, youre landing on the roof or youre parachuting in. What's the vision there?; How is Archer the leader? Joby is more than double Archer’s market cap; Archer’s focus on scalability and outsourcing to Tier 1 suppliers really does give it an edge over Joby’s vertically integrated approach. Being first to market in the eVTOL space could be a game-changer, and the Trump administration’s support for VTOL tech adds an interesting political boost.

The valuation gap between Archer and Joby feels way off given where Archer is positioned. If they hit their production and certification milestones, the upside could be huge. Are you holding long term or planning to take profits as they hit these milestones?; I have 150 contracts ranging 4.5C - 6C expiry January

I’m watching closely !!!

Actually bought high and kept buying the dip; I just want to say you cooked. Subbed; Joby is first not archer; Why would you buy this over Joby? The Joby aircraft looks better in every way.; I get that most of us are nerds that are really into cars, planes, and spaceships, but there are easier ways to make money in the market than speculating on early stage companies that have to build insanely complex machines and the infrastructure required to do so. 

Do I believe in VTOL? Yes! Is now the time to try and speculate on who will end up winning that market? lol absolutely not.; Whats with all the gay shares? Havent you regards heard of calls?; Bought 1k shares today, thanks for the analysis 👍; Just bought 200 shares. Figured if someone could write this much about it then it must be decent haha.; Say no more. I’m in.; PLUS analysts just upgraded the stock! It’s a no brainer. 40,000 shares and aiming for $8-$10 by year end.; !remindme 2 months; The primary costs associated with air travel are not fuel, it’s maintenance. Airlines can keep costs low with fuckloads of people on board, hidden fees etc. Taxis run on volume, more volume = more maintenance, This is going to be the world’s most expensive taxi.; If you think any of these established suppliers are going to prioritize eVTOL parts vs anything DPAS rated or for single aisle planes, I've got a penny stock to sell you.; They won't make money for God knows how long and driving to the nearest helipad to pay an exorbitant amount of money to fly to another helipad pretty close by -- by which point I could have just driven where I wanted to go anyways -- seems like an awful business plan.  They'll likely need to dilute shareholders multiple times to raise money until they are profitable.   

That being said, I thought similar things about oklo and space stocks and missed insane gains on those, and this play seems stupid enough that I see similarity.  I'm in; This read like an infomercial.


…but wait there’s more!; I sold a bunch at $3.50ish for a profit and wish I held.; Been on their instagram for a bit. They do some really good work. And just seeing this post decided for me to get on robinhood and get some shares. Proud to be part of the community.; Just watched a video on YouTube. Almost bust juice when I saw the prototype. Going to increase my position on open.; I know there's some amazing discussions going on here of who's first to market, who has a better implementation and better understanding of regulatory rules. I do want to make the point that none of these things matter much if the product is ""cool"". Archer is cool; they understand design, marketing and the brand oozes sex. Joby is a bit lame, they plucked some designer from the deep 90's and really is the IBM when Archer is Apple. Ofcourse, that wouldn't again matter much if our new president Elon wouldn't be so horndog over exactly this, the cool factor of branding and product design. 

TLDR I guess I'm buying ACHR.; Warrants been ripping since getting in around .50, good stuff; Bought this morning. Thanks for the DD; With Emil Michael NOT being Trump's Transportation Secretary pick, does this section no longer apply as much?; Bought in when this was posted, up 30% since then, planning on holding for a while. They're looking at possible full  FAA clearance next year, both ACHR and JOBY have solid investments from major companies, both can probably post their first profitable qtr either late next year or early 2026. A flying UBER to LAX that beats traffic is going to make a killing, same idea in NYC, and possibly in places like London and other major cities. Biggest concern is building out infrastructure for parking, charging and helipads, assuming the get the FAA clearance they're on track for.; Anybody else think it’s too late to ACHR? Day late and a dollar short i guess; IM IN.; [deleted]; I have leaps; I bought 75 $5.50c expiring December 6th. Literally have no idea what this company does. Flying taxis in Dubai? I just see it mentioned here all the time; ACHR’s short sale volume index is on par with AMDs and GME’s @ 6.6m. Forecast indicators are positive, however short top suppression could smother calls. Long positions may be more favorable but I’d expect within the next week a 5-10% and perhaps even 20% drop with folks taking liquidity. I’ll watch it but not buy yet.

Edit: I’ll take your hate; Tldr? Why not just buy more of mstr?; Holding 1/15/25 5c, 1/15/25 8c , 1/15/27 5c; 250 shares at a $3 average. Should’ve loaded up on more; Why is this pinned?; 200 leaps, im in; Alright boys, I’m in.; Me waiting for $4 still like 🤡; I currently own 10,000 shares. Honest question here:
If each midnight costs 5 million and by the end of 2026 the Georgia plant will be making 24 per year, we’re only looking at 120 million for the year. How can the revenue keep up with the costs?; Finally a DD where almost everyone agrees and All In; Didn’t read any of this but I’m in for 100 shares; Who are the primary competitors in the air taxi space (as simplified as that question sounds)?; 4 hrs ago post, 550 upvotes and a sub $5 price? 

I'm in usonovabish; Dumped all (not much) my calls after that monster run and buying leaps before close again.; i’m in; I only respond here and there to these posts, but you sold me. Purchasing now thanks; I went balls deep at $5 yesterday. Please tell me Im not gonna be bag holding.; I am bullish on transportation especially with their current - and future - partnerships. Remember: disruptors were once told they were going to never take off, no pun intended. TO THE MOON; Please hit $6 by Friday LFG; The amount of time I heard Stellantis’s investment mentioned had me a little concerned. They’re banking on that money for scalability of manufacturing.; I'm curious what the pipeline will look like for the areas of aviation besides FAA type certification. What is the timeline for pilot certifications and what will that look like? Will they be add ons to or a new category of rotorcraft certs? Will there need to be new FARS in place before wide scale usage? Or new ATC positions as well as procedures to implement high volume traffic routes in and around class B airspace since that seems to be what they are advertising with big city air taxi operations.; It’s not popping up on Fidelity. Any idea why?; Beta>archer; Time to buy 10 shares🫡; i put the faith of my portfolio in your hands, random stranger. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); I can see this being an effective business only in gridlocked cities. Having it be electric brings the cost of operation down, and if you could incorporate AI into flying it instead of having a pilot, with a modest fare, it just might be profitable. I’ll keep it in my watch list; Fuck it I'm in; 4.5c is making me money so shit I’ll bite for a Jan call. But if I lose the 50$ I’m about to spend I’m sending you the bill 😤; I’m holding my calls and shares for a long time.; I'm long $ACHR and $JOBY; Great DD!

When I read ""air taxi,"" I think of moving people, but perhaps delivery if items which aren't quite 300 pounds and able to jostle around in a seat is more realistic?  I dunno.  I guess.

Holding throughout next year at least.; Serious question, I thought JOBY was already at market?; Okay, it went up to 9.48. Was that the exit moment?; There is something to be said about archers ability to scale so quickly. 

Joby has been working on their air vehicle for nearly a decade. Archer for 2-3 years. 

I think both companies win market share, but I think archer is the better commercial play (where the money is). 

Plus, archer seems to have caught up in government contracting, too, which I thought joby would have a chokehold on. 

Both get defense/gov contracts, but archers seems more intent on getting to market; I can’t get over “ become an aviation millionaire starting with a billion “; The fact that this write up mentioned the trump administration multiple times as a positive means this is an obvious short. Especially when he wants a fracking guy to head energy and is notorious for not really caring about policy. I’m still not seeing the big distinguishing factor between this and a helicopter. And in a world with less commuting, is solving a commuting problem for rich people really a game changer?; It has a long way to go before it is economic, battery capabilities just arent there yet. Will fall more in the next week.; I like the moves Archer has been making, at least their updates and agree they are a bit ahead of Joby.   I also think the turnaround happening at XTI is significant and their Trifan approach will have a nice niche.; I brought up ACHR like 4 months ago. Nice to see people are looking at it now; I am all in on ACHR.  I've been following this since its SPAC; Do u have a source for this? Just curious to do some reading; Can you peeps help me understand the conviction y’all have? The range is up to 50 miles for 4 passengers at a cost of ~$5M/vehicle that will require a VTOL pad, charging infrastructure and all the other safety and security hurdles of flight. 

Don’t get me wrong I would love to quickly cross over LA or NYC but I feel like (this is where I need help) there’s just a mountain of work required to integrate this product and I’m struggling to see the economies of scale here.; That would make for a nice Christmas gift; I already bought some shares a week ago; Do you expect price action as a result of this catalyst?; Where's the information on this? I'm having trouble finding it online; They're also diluting shares a lot aren't they; Do you have source for this? I can't find any press sayinf their first piloted flight is in December. Where and when is the event?; Did they say when in December?; JOBY was doing manned flights last year, this is not really news at this point.; Added to the watchlist / probably going to buy when bored / dont know what the fuck they selling 😭; Same, there were a lot of words in the post which means it was good; I respect your investing strategy friend; 😂😂😂😂😅; Imagine if you bought 100 shares of NVDA at 5 bucks a share ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); I thought this about PLTR, RKLB, ASTS, LUNR, TSLA, BTC so I think you might right; Inverse coming…; I hope sometime in the future the top comment on every post will stop being ""dur, do opposite"" in the SpongeBob meme; 
This is a huge opportunity to jump in on the ground floor into an emerging market that governments and institutional investors are pouring money into.

But go ahead and be a regard.; Its always a broke boy karma farmer who makes comments like these. You wont buy puts, you wont buy anything. Youre going to sit on the side and talk with empty pockets while opportunities pass you by.; [deleted]; typically you would be right, but this time is the exception. lol. SO SERIOUS.; And I just decided on my lambo’s color.; Lmao, how is that going for ya?; How did that work out for you bud?; This is a classic inverse but ill still fall for it; It’s done until the US Army starts using their tech for hover tanks and jetpacks for paratroopers.

In this capitalistic world, the rich are getting richer. And what better way to not only travel in convenience but also show off your immense wealth by travelling in a fucking flying taxi? This business is gonna boom once the regulations are through; I mean 
I'd love tsla or space x to compete really be good for innovation; What kind of calls just made 124% on 5 11/22 calls at .10 but what kind of calls are you looking for at esp with that 10-12$ range; You sum it up nicely. These milestones will hit and the company will get to the next level. It's in the early stages and they are working their tails off. LfG.; Asking as another pilot, not as someone who knows anything about the stock. 

Where do they propose to land these things? The rotor wash on 12 little tiny rotors will be insane and putting them in established airports will be too cumbersome for a consumer to get to, not to mention out of the way of the commute. Charging the massive battery will require a dedicated ground  station. Takeoffs and landing will be loud as fuck. 

What is the lifespan of the airframe or maintenance cycle? A battery powered aircraft will go through a full charge cycle after every flight. Do they control the production of batteries? Who do they buy from? 

Who is flying these things? It takes like 2 years to make a shitty helicopter pilot. For these to be commercially viable won't they need hundreds if not thousands of pilots? They will be competing with sexier jobs like fire and EMS for ex military pilots. 

Speaking of shortage of labor and maintenance, where will these things be maintained and who will maintain them? I understand the electric drivetrain is simpler, but they will likely still need A&P maintainers to work on them. 

I have no doubt that the technology will work, but I don't see the commercial viability in the near future.; On board with everything you said. Just don’t forgot Production Certification. That’s one of the most important certs for aircraft companies. It’s one thing to type certify an aircraft, but it’s another to allow it to be built and sold at scale; Ask any Marine and they try to stay away from the osprey lol 😝; Considering the Fact that UAE is a huge market, no one truly rich wants to drive. Aviation of shorter commute times in high density wealthy areas will multiply. If you truly have money, you will fly from Dubai to the new Wynn 70 miles up north in 10 minutes vs 1.5 hour drive; It’s the FAA Type Certification in late 2025 I don’t believe. I think they’re years away. Late 2026 is a lot more believable and I suspect some time in 2027 is more likely than that.; Same; What are your thoughts on Joby? The partnerships with Delta and Uber, plus Toyota funding, makes it look like it's leading in the industry.; So each aircraft only sells for 5 million dollars? How is this company gonna make any meaningful profit off that?; [deleted]; Positions or ban; I’ve got something like 80 shares now. It was so cheap when I bought that I figured even if it’s a stinker I will almost certainly be able to sell above what I bought in at. I might grab more honestly.

You'll buy at ATH and it will dip, and then feel regarded and ask yourself why does this always happen to you.; Still waiting for the dip?; Did you get any; Flexin on us; You goat. What price per share; same, just bought $1,500 worth; Friendly Aviation Administration; Agreed. I don’t see how a glorified helicopter has commercial viability at scale.; im student pilot btw so obv not as much experience as you but cool to see other pilots. i completely agree FAA and any government agency is slow af to change. but what do u think about it long term. like long long term. personally i think its a pretty solid investment. maybe not this company exactly but the whole idea will definitely work out in 20-30 years i would say. aviation industry is growing more and more and stuff like this kinda grows exponentially. think about delivery drivers utilizing this. celebs, senators, etc. just like cars, it will start out as niche, but before long everyone will use them. planes were the same way. look at how much aviation grew from 1903 to the 60’s.; The brigading here feels like crypto m00n sh0ts; 500 shares here at 3.75; Oh. Now I gotta scroll back up. I skipped the page and now I'm asking dumb questions in the comment section..

So what's the Tldr?; Joby is a better bet IMO. All companies doing this are somewhat of a long shot due to overcrowded competition while the TAM is highly debatable. 

Joby is ahead in terms of funding, testing, and the pedigree of its team is top notch. Archer’s main advantage is a more traditional supply chain, which it expects will help it to clear FAA hurdles faster and allow for a resilient manufacturing operation. Both have some very solid partnerships.

A few other companies are looking like they’ll fail, but then you have the later EIS competitors like Wisk (Boeing owned but doing well despite that), CityAirbus, EVE, Hyundai, Honda, and many  hopefully startups.

All of those established companies will likely have high quality aircraft, with the disadvantage of being later to market. The plus side there is an infrastructure and regulatory environment that’s ideally already somewhat established – that will not be the case for Joby and Archer and those things are going to be a real challenge if they want to meet EIS targets.

Aerospace suppliers, or at least the one I work for and the others I’m engaged with, largely view eVTOL as an opportunity to establish technological pedigree in electric propulsion, rather than the next big thing. In other words, proving successful on this tech will help them get contracts on more lucrative aircraft programs.

Pick a horse or two, but don’t be afraid to take profit when you’re up and don’t be surprised if the floor falls out quick. Virtually every single one of these Archer posts significantly simplify the regulatory and infrastructure challenges. They also severely miss how large the range of outcomes is regarding demand.

There’s a reason why many in the aerospace industry are skeptical. To be fair, disruption often starts that way.

Edit: goddammit I did not realize how much I just typed. TLDR – Joby good too but both maybe bad, idk; 100% in on JOBY as well. They are way ahead and even have a deal with UBER which just adds value.; This 👆 joby is a better bet.; You know what else seems unlikely here? The inevitable noise ordinances in NY and other cities allowing these to take flight anywhere near where people live.  My buddy got a $800 fine for driving his unmodified Porsche Carrera through Manhattan. It's insane.; someone was not listening at their latest Q3 earnings. Joby was a shitshow. Dodging questions no real deadlines....; And here I am sitting on my 4$ calls. I did exercise a few of my previous 3.5$ calls.; Stock go up is all that matter 😭; Even if they don't outsource it there will always be parts that need to be imported. Their is next to no company that is not impacted by the nonsense of Mr. T; what lind of calls are you going for? I am trying to figure out, jaut sold my 5$ 11/22 .10c calls; I was squawking about rocketlab at $3.50….. now look at it. Just read the news people and keep up with government regulations / contracts. Its not hard to find gems when you have time to study and stay informed; followed; So do you think you are going to make money (off others) if no one knows about the stock. lol; Joby’s way better, tons of patents, will be released first, better specs across the board. Vertically integrated. ACHR was launched as a scam SPAC before it even had a flying prototype. I’m not saying ACHR is worthless it’s just not at the same caliber as JOBY. Would definitely recommend doing your own research before making a big play. Lot of people are going to get burnt by Archer that don’t understand it; I personally believe archer is behind... Attending just a regulation archer is behind, also if you look at the designs archer seems a fight drone or some military thing and joby is a really friendly round shaped big bird.

I think investor don´t look at the important things to attract initial public and design is one of them.

Also some technicalities like battery life makes joby lead the race too...; Perpetually \~1 year behind Joby, but all reporting and fanboys pretend it's the other way around. When every Archer press release mentions ""...*very difficult milestone few companies have reached...*"", ""*Archer is one of two air taxi manufacturers in the world..."",* the other company is always Joby, and they did it a year before.; What is the thought process behind buying 10 $9 calls instead of 1 bigger call for $9?

You don't think it's too late ? Also what do you guys think are good call options strategies?; I am comparing between them vs. ACHR so ai am seeing more room for them to go up, similar idea here https://www.reddit.com/r/JobyAviation/s/DTUtcRpMQy; Check again; The big distinguising factor between heli is obvious: cost, noise, and pilot training. The goal is that there will be base trajectories these taxis will take, so with minimal pilot interference and taking customer from A to B a whole lot faster than a car ever could. 

Initially I didn't buy in because I didn't see this happening any time soon with all the regulatory rules and regulations, but seeing as the Trump admin won't give a single fuck about laws or regulations all it will take is to say some nice things about Trump tower and tell Elon he's amazing at jumping and his head doesn't at all look like a melted lego and voila we got FAA approval.; The aircraft isn't meant to carry poor plebians, just rich Arabs and whatnot.; Battery has already proven it can complete its designed envelope. Will batteries get better? Yes. Is the current battery going to complete its mission for what is planned now? Also yes. They are already building heliports in NYC with conforming chargers; Nah, they already have a 6.2 billion dollar order book. Loads of confidence in their battery capabilities.; Their plan is short (less than 30 minute) flights in densely populated areas with a lot of traffic. For example they will have a route from Manhattan to JFK airport that takes about 10 minutes as apposed to 50 by car or 60 by train. Batteries are already capable of handling those distances.; I'm all in on ACHR too bro,  this shit got my stomach feeling funny.; So you're bag holding?; Bot account here or prove your position… 9 day account; [https://aviationweek.com/aerospace/advanced-air-mobility/archer-open-georgia-factory-coming-weeks](https://aviationweek.com/aerospace/advanced-air-mobility/archer-open-georgia-factory-coming-weeks); This will initially cater to people in corporate jobs as a company vehicle to get in and out of town quickly. Same target market as a company helicopter. But being a vtol and not having gas, you can probably get away with putting them in places you couldn't put a conventional helicopter.; I understand. It would take a lot of time to discuss this. For me, everything will happen little by little. Roads developed at the same time as cars. I immediately see the benefit for an airline to offer this all-in-one service, you do all the checks and you check in from the vertiport, not at the airport. MIDNIGHT is designed for high cadence, low charge time flights. Otherwise it can be used for tourist flights. I'm European, I can see myself treating myself to a flight over New York. Access to the stadiums too. At first it will be reserved for the rich, just like cars at first.; Seriously… that’s a great point and a major issue isn’t it? I mean what’s the IRR?; Imagine how hospitals in cities and very rural areas could utilize them. Transportation after natural disasters too potentially. Then of course military capabilities.; Yessir; I think that while everyone at WSB has heard of ACHR, the general public is not yet aware of the company. The 100% piloted flight of a production aircraft will have a double effect: powerful visibility and technological validation.; [https://aviationweek.com/aerospace/advanced-air-mobility/archer-open-georgia-factory-coming-weeks](https://aviationweek.com/aerospace/advanced-air-mobility/archer-open-georgia-factory-coming-weeks); For a growth stock, the important thing is knowing how to dilute. ACHR has a progressive fundraising method that supports growth. This is very different from brutal fundraisers.; JOBY has never conducted a 100% pilot-controlled flight in the aircraft. JOBY carried out a flight with a pilot on board, but controlled from the ground, with a prototype. ACHR will soon carry out a flight 100% controlled by the pilot on board, with a production aircraft intended for sale.; Selling dreams. Fairy dust. Fugazi. That being said I bought 200 shares last week incase it's not fugazi.; I’m holding until the sky car company pays for my son’s education 😎; ACHR isn’t NVDA; Sooo... I should reverse reverse your idea?; Tetha gang making a bank; welcome to the post gamestonk wsb; Exactly. It was funny for a while but now its a distraction. Posts like this is the equivalent of a class clown making noise whille everyone else is trying to get ahead; Is this written by ChatGPT?; It's a joke not a dick, don't take it so hard; Each plane costs $5M, and can shuttle 4 people for up to 20 mins.  Who is buying this?  Genuinely curious, because I would like to be long, but I just can't figure out who their customers will be.; The world's major airlines have signed partnerships with ACHR or JOBY. It is the foundation of their profession to assess the commercial viability of air transport. Owners of existing vertiports and airports are already adapting. eVTOLs will use “air routes”.; Two airports already have vertiports being built currently; I say the same thing. Im not here for the viability, im here for the pump and dump; my guess is these celebrities and government officials that take 15 minute private jet flights across a single city like LA. there is definitely a market idk about how big. im buying because i think its cool lol and i think in 20-30 years it will be a larger market. even if your not as long on as i am i definitely think there is money to be made on it in the following year; https://preview.redd.it/fzb1vjbk952e1.jpeg?width=1079&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8a70fb3e143028ef0e505c6d9c318946d95c68de

You changed my mind; their ""tech""? Its a fucking wright brothers 8 propelly flying machine lol; Do they have proprietary tech / patents they can lisence?; TSLA will announce a similar option and the stock will go up 30%; Yeah I trust a pilots opinion on an aircraft now we need an engineer or regulations expert to judge the remaining parts; Yeah I don't see it happening sooner than that unless Trump deregulated everything after taking office, which seems.. unlikely.; Right place right time with a .05 call option lol; 4c rolled to 4.5c expiring this week bought at the beginning of the month.; I'm at 3000 shares - really expecting this to be the TSLA of eVTOLS; i'll buy at 3.50; Nah go in Red Cat instead.; Here are the numbers before pre market.
The shares and 87 calls are in tax sheltered accounts.


10 calls  $5 strike Jan 16 2026. Cost .95 up 167%

14500 shares.  Cost 4.23 up 42%

87 calls $7 strike Jan 16 2027. Cost .95 up 182%; Watched Joby fly on Monday. I’ve been to both plants in CA. In terms of production they’re both at around the same spot. I’d take Joby over Archer, but I don’t think either is a functional business.; They’re really quiet compared to other aircraft. Think of an electric car vs diesel; Archer is a less tested prototype with debateable confidence to meet meaningful deadlines. It’s an inferior aircraft in every way to Joby. Joby flies faster and further distances by considerable amounts. The airforce has been testing Joby’s planes since Sept 2023. Archer got them a test prototype like what a month ago? Archer’s founder mysteriously left and they restructured stock offerings to buy him out. Pretty sure Archer was founded at the same time it’s SPAC was launched. JOBY has been loading patents, IP, autonomous tech, manufacturing insights for decades. We’re about to go heavy anti-tariff and Archer is dependent on foreign manufacturing, Joby is vertical with manufacturing in the US (CA + Dayton, Ohio). Money goes to Joby. All are probably going to fall flat on actual utility eventually. I would rather risk it with EVEX over Archer, Archer is just a sketchy and shitty company if you do the research.; Helicopter go up. Stock go up. That’s too much of a coincidence for me not to go all in.; Sadly, this is true lol; Sadly, this is true lol; But companies who are already established who may have the capacity to move some manufacturing to NA will be better suited than startups.; $5c 12/27. Give it some time for theta and IV crush. You might see some overnight pump and you be ok but I think 11/22 the Greeks gonna kill you if you’re not itm.; Where do you read this stuff tho; If it were this simple, wouldn't a lot more people be successful?; If it were this simple, wouldn't a lot more people be successful?; Drop the gems. Dm on the low? I'm poor need money   😭; No I think I'll make money when the company I've done a lot of DD on and hopefully get in at a lower price point and maybe get to retire before my nuts are hanging at my knees, before some ass hat plasters the ticker on the front page of WSB for a bunch of regards looking to get rich quick to pump it followed by an inevitable correction; Neither are commercially viable. If you look past all the tech, the mission profile is essentially a helicopter. 

The demand for that isn’t there so not sure why people think transitioning to eVTOL will suddenly change that.; Not to mention top speed and flight range. As I recall, JOBY leads there too. I'm invested in both b/c...who the F knows what's going to happen?; What do you mean by one bigger call? If the price to buy the call is $.10, I can’t make it bigger.; Crash?

what crash; Ask Boeing; Insurance, building a pilot cohort from scratch, FAA approval of air taxis, an entirely new corridor structure for every city that adopts it and the infrastructure to land them.

I trusted this regard because he used a lot of words!; I concur; That video is on the JOBY site, not the Archer one; Did you poop yourself?; Thanks! I’m assuming this is the line for those wondering

“The first type-conforming Midnight, meanwhile, is being manufactured at Archer’s low-rate initial-production facility in San Jose, California. Chief Technology Officer Tom Muniz says the aircraft is in the systems-integration testing phase and “almost complete.” But he held off on declaring a firm target for an initial flight. Previously, management indicated plans to fly before the year-end.”; ""Located on a 100-acre site adjacent to the Covington Municipal Airport, the 350,000 ft.2 facility is on track to open “in the coming weeks,” Archer’s founder and CEO Adam Goldstein announced""

No public info that says they are not...; whats the safety compared to helicopters?  I hear helicopters are death machines; Helicopter tours already exist you know...; Hopefully it comes down from its current peak as the trend Indicates so we can load up on calls before December; Happened with LUNR. Everyone knew they would get the contract, but after they got the contract, more people found out about the company so the stock jumped 50%.; Few countries just had their first test flight. This give us more time to get cheap shares; This is about the factory opening not the manned flight; Can you share an article or something confirming this? I haven't been able to find it on the web and I want to share it with a friend; [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYaxVHtFK2g) is a video from 2023 showing Joby's aircraft being flown by a pilot onboard.; I bought 200 as well a few weeks ago and have a 40% return.  If I bought a few weeks prior when people were first discussing it I would have doubled my money.  For how stupid this fucking sub is, if you just play stocks and not options you really end up shaking out okay; Dreams are a hot fucking commodity right now.

Hopefully with NVDA tendies ![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787); you really think eVTOLS will take off (no pun intended) with the public? I am honestly curious if this is something that sounds amazing theoretically, but rejected enmasse by the public (much like the mistrust autonomous driving for ridiculous reasons). This is not me being bearish, I have a position and hoping for the best, but I worry.; I’m tempted to dump $1000 into this one in simple stock. I bought my first 20 shares almost as a joke but the more I read about the tech the more interested I am.; Username fits; Don't be fresh!; Thanks just brought in pre market. Hopefully im.not bag holding; YET. ;); I think of drones...

I work in the World Trade Center and there are helicopters going by every few minutes. Will it replace ground travel for normies, probably not. So what's the size of that market? Definitely not Uber or Robotaxi sized.

That said, you can land a helicopter smoothly even when the engine cuts out. I'm not sure what the options are when a motor goes out in an eVTOL.

211,"Qualcomm says it expects $4 billion in PC chip sales by 2029, as company gets traction beyond smartphones","Qualcomm said on Tuesday that it expects its push into new markets to generate an additional $22 billion per year by 2029.

Of that amount, roughly $4 billion will come from PC chips, Qualcomm said at its investor day on Tuesday. The chipmaker just introduced PC processors earlier this year, when it released Snapdragon X for Windows devices.

The latest forecast marks an important milestone for Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon, who took over the company in 2021 with a promise to get past a reliance on smartphones. In fiscal 2024, Qualcomm’s handset business reported $24.86 billion in sales, about 75% of its entire chip business.

Qualcomm also said on Tuesday that automotive revenues would rise about 175% by 2029 to $8 billion, of which 80% is tied to contracts that have already been secured.

*″*We have been on this trajectory realizing that the technologies we have developed over the many years can be very relevant to a number of different industries beyond mobile,” Amon said at the investor event.

Another $4 billion in revenue will come from industrial chips and $2 billion will come from chips for headsets, a category Qualcomm calls XR. About $4 billion of the forecast is a catch-all for other chip sales, like those for wireless headphones and tablets.

Qualcomm shares are up 16% this year, trailing the Nasdaq, which has gained 26%.

Qualcomm grew rapidly over the past decade as its modems and processors became essential parts for high-end smartphones, especially those running Google Android. Qualcomm also sells modems and related parts to Apple for its iPhones.

But the company has warned investors that Apple could choose to stop buying Qualcomm parts as soon as 2027. Qualcomm said on Tuesday that its growing businesses will more than offset any losses from Apple.

Qualcomm’s strategy under Amon has been to use the technology its developed for its handset chips, like modems, processors, and AI accelerators, in new markets, including cars, PCs, and virtual reality. The investor event was the first time in years that the company has given a forecast for those new markets. Qualcomm said its total addressable market is as large as $900 billion.

“We put a strategy in ’21, and we’re not changing our strategy,” Amon said.

Laptop and desktop chips are currently dominated by Intel, which has over 70% percent of the market, according to Mercury Research. Intel reported $29 billion in PC chip sales in its 2023.

“The competitive landscape changed between the Windows and Macs,” Amon said, referring to Apple’s move in 2020 to switch from Intel to its own processors. “We saw that as an opportunity, especially as the ecosystem did not have confidence in the existing players to actually deliver a solution.”

The forecast for XR headsets also hints at the growth potential of the VR market over the next five years. Qualcomm supplies chips to many of the top headset makers, including Meta for its Quest and Ray-Bans products.

When it comes to artificial intelligence, Qualcomm calls itself an “edge AI” company, in contrast to cloud-based AI that’s typically powered by Nvidia processors. Company officials didn’t rule out introducing data center products in an interview with CNBC.

Qualcomm suggested that its mobile chips will be able to run the kind of advanced AI that’s restricted to large server farms today, an indication that that company may benefit from the AI boom down the road as the technology becomes more efficient.

“What you can run on the cloud last year, you can run on the device this year,” Durga Malladi, Qualcomm’s senior vice president in charge of planning, said at the event.

Intel recently released ~~Arrow~~ Lunar Lake made Qualcomm computers irrelevant; Just driving a car also uses a lot of chips.; Working in a big project with partners that develop commercial engineering software and know their clients.

x86 is just a massive advantage just because of legacy, there are tons of code and binaries in use that are just critical and hard to port to another architecture. And translation layers are... Problematic.

So, on the pro side specially, AMD and Intel are on the winning team, and on the gaming side it seems similar.

Only the basic, web centric use case is where ARM can compete, something more akin to chromebooks and macbooks. But there, as architectures are easier to replace, RISC-V could boom too.

As I see it, ARM is under a bigger threat from RISC-V than x86 under ARM.; I dont think AMD has that level of market power to stop Qualcomm. They will definitely hit 4B in chip sales by then. X Elite is already solid and next gen will have big improvements as they move from N4 to N3(P). We already see 8 Elite showing big improvement from X Elite. 

I expect app compatibility to improve big time as well as adoption increases.; AMD has arm chips??; In what magical manner is this bullsih for Intel, you think that rev will come from new markets? Not likely. Trying to eat at the Intel/AMD duopoly.; great insight professor; Their smartphone processors had no reason to be   competitive because buyers weren't choosing them based on performance, they needed a cellular capable SoC and Qualcomm's patents make it the only practical choice on the cellular side so customers had to buy whatever CPU Qualcomm wanted to bundle with it.  

The only company with the unit volume and pricing power to pay Qualcomm separately for the cellular capability and a different CPU/GPU is Apple.; Doubt. ; > Intel recently released Arrow Lake

I think you mean Lunar Lake.; Neither Lunar Lake nor Arrow Lake is selling all that well. Intel even admitted that Lunar Lake is more of a niche product with terrible margins compared to Snapdragon X Elite that has been a broadly launched product in the market.


Snapdragon X Elite is fine and developers can use it to further optimise their code for successors that will be released on a regular basis.; Yea well both new processors by Intel and AMD perform better across the board while consuming less power and having no restrictions on what apps you can or cant use, so theres ARM for ya.; He's probably talking about the rumor that QCOM may buy INTC.; No insight needed… their genuinely shit.; Legacy compatibility of code is just a massive factor.

ARM is under a bigger threat by RISC-V where code compatibility is not an issue, if we're talking about architecture comparisons.

x86 is more than safe, and a winning bet especially in professional workloads and gaming.; Wheres the link chief?; Intel has fallen behind and they will soon be eliminated.; Writing off Qualcomm after their first gen implementation seems foolish. I wouldn't bet against them catching up within 5 years. How many engineers have Intel lost this year?; Why?; They’re*

212,Help/advice with $$$,"Turn 10k ➡️ 100k ➡️ 1m➡️10m➡️100m  

I am going to invest about $10,000.

How would you do it and where would you put it to receive high percentage dividends but also yield long term growth?

I have a “general” idea but any advice from all of you would be greatly appreciated.

Using Fidelity/RobinHood here’s my plan:

Dividend Stocks (50%): For consistent income.

ETFs: Considering ETFs like Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (VYM) or iShares Select Dividend ETF (DVY) for diversified exposure.

Individual Stocks: Companies like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Procter & Gamble (PG), or Coca-Cola (KO) are known for reliable dividends.

Growth Stocks (30%): For high growth potential.

Technology (e.g., Apple, NVIDIA, Microsoft) or healthcare innovation.

ETFs: Growth-focused ETFs like ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) or Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG) provide diversified growth exposure.

Low-Risk Assets (20%): HY Savings Account 

High-yield savings accounts, CDs (Certificates of Deposit), and money market account through my credit union bank ",https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1gv9d6s/helpadvice_with/,2,2024-11-19 23:05:19,"You don't have enough money to pick individual stocks or concentrated ETFs without taking a great risk that in the long run you will be lucky to break. 7 out of 8 active investors fail to beat the cumulative return of the SP 500  over a 10 year period. 

If you have a long term investment timeframe, put everything into a low cost diversified ETF like VOO or SPY and reinvest the dividends. When you have more to invest in the future, keep it separate from this account that you are creating now.; Duke power. Put it in and leave it. Invest the dividends; For dividends, SCHD is a great addition to VYM/DVY. For growth, big tech is smart but maybe skip ARKK (bit too volatile) Low-risk with HY savings/CDs is perfect. Best of luck.; With this you can't get effect of compounding. as you have very little money. go with anyone ETF. or select Individual Stocks Minimum 5 that's solve; You have a lot of options but I would consider the following:

DCA a combo of SCHD and VIG total of 5k based on your posted risk tolerance 50%

QQQM and SMH for the 30% allocation to growth

Low risk assets 20% - reconsider due to age but if u know your risk tolerance then either long term Treasury or CD 

Not advice but should be satisfied

Also - if you have high conviction for a specific security, don't let someone bully you out of a position within reason; You’re right in thinking you should buy a vanguard eft or VOO. Then split $1000 in one or two companies you really like. I’d buy and hold reddit until the next quarter at least. I love your overall plan though. It’s very sensible and solid, you’d just need a bit more money to make it worthwhile ☺️ Good luck!; Following; Check out resolv stable coin(game changer )


https://app.resolv.xyz/overview; So you would suggest putting everything into VOO, SPY or one or the other?; Why would you keep future investments separated in a different account?; How IS not having ""enough"" money IS a risk on individual stock ? You mean hé couldn't buy enough différent stock to match the diversity of a voo or Spy ?; That’s exactly what I was thinking. Reinvest dividends; If I eliminated the low risk assets and allocated it to the others for a 50% (SCHD & VIG) / 50% (QQQM & SMH)

How do you think I’m looking? Diversified? Potential for some income to reinvest or save and long term growth?; Thank you!   

I’m really trying to turn:  10k ➡️ 100k ➡️ 1m➡️10m➡️100m  

I was thinking 50% into VOO/SPY or VOO/SCHD or a variety of mixtures, 30% VUG/NVIDIA/GOOGL/NLY, 20% into a High Yield or Money Market that gives 4.25% every month.; Why Reddit...it's almost up 150% in the last 3 months.; One or the other. VOO has slightly lower fees. SPY is better for options trading.; If you go the Fidelity route, look up FXAIX 

VOO is an ETF with 0.03% fees
FXAIX is a mutual fund with 0.015% fees
(Half of VOO) 

Apart from that, they are the same. 

If you plan to park and DCA,  FXAIX can save you some $ on fees; Different accounts with different investment goals.; Correct. And if he did, then why do all that heavy lifting to match the return? Invest in individual stocks for alpha.; You would be diversified but I would probably opt to use the other 20% to invest in a SP500 fund or an international large cap ETF.  

I may have been tired but I thought I read that you were around 30-31 yrs old?  

Reason I ask is the 20% allocation to bonds/CDs.; I think that’s an awesome plan ☺️ 4.25% is a very good return. Will you come back and advise what you find?; It’s going to keep going up imo.; So you would put all $7500-$10000 into (let’s just say) VOO and not put any money in SCHD, Apple, Amazon or any other high dividend blue chip company?; Not a Bad point but it  doesn't forbid you to have a litle  part of your investment on some small you really beleive in 
2-10% on a pltr or rklb stock can't hurt you 

But There is also older ppl that just wake UP and don't have enough Time left to really make a différence with an etf , and that are Willing to take more risky moves than 20yo who Can Hope only work 20year with 8% return etf; Yes I’m 30

So you would allocate and invest into a SP500 fund like SPY??? 

What international large cap ETF do you trust and own?; Correct. If you are young and have a long term time horizon I would prioritize growth over dividend income.; I'd do something along the lines of:

$6000 - SCHG or SCHX 

$2500 - MSFT or GOOGL (DACA cause of AT suit)

$1500 - SCHD or a REIT (ADC, O) or ET; First, please keep in mind that there is no perfect answer and vet all responses you receive.

Personally, I like IEFA and IEMG.  It has plenty of legit industries and sectors that should be secular.

Please hit me up if u need anything further; I’m 30 so definitely have time for long term growth…also would not mind some dividends to reinvest.

I like what you’re saying so definitely going to get my plans straighten out and get it started; I like this model as well but I’m someone that learns by explanation (I’m not being cheeky) *pause*

Can you give more info why you’d go this route?; Completely understand there is not a perfect answer to anything like this.  I have my own plan; however, understand that there are individuals like yourself and others that are more skilled and advance than I in this industry.

I’m very much welcome any of your thoughts or recommendations regardless if it’s aligns with my plan fully or partial.

Information is King brother !; It really sounds like you have an over inflated view of dividend stocks. Just because something returns a dividend doesn't immediately make it better than other stocks.

A share that has a 10 % increase yoy in return will always be better than a share that has a 2 % increase but pays a 3% dividend.; Good luck. In 35 years your 10,000 could grow to around 320,000 at a 10% rate of return. Won't guarantee a comfortable retirement, but will certainly help.; For sure!  Hit me up anytime if you have anything you'd like to bounce an idea off of!  I wish more ppl would share info so we can all try to make some money!

Keep up the good fight.; I’m assuming you’re are talking to Curiosity…"

All traders learn this lesson somehow. Some pay more than others. Just keep trying. 20 trading days is a lot to work with. keep going or quit. This sounds like harsh advice but in reality, trading is not for everyone.; never place your happiness or mental well being in money. You are falling for the traps of society.; Life throws curveballs. Especially when you think you are on top of the world, the markets have a way to humble you.

But i wish from the bottom of heart for your problems to be fixed; ask god for help; Damn bro, did you get cooked so hard you forgot how to paragraph?; I get the feeling bro when you feel like you’re defined by your current and past circumstances but YOU’RE NOT. You’re defined by how you RESPOND to them. If you want to continue trading keep doing it. Don’t give up. Make sure you’re doing it for the right reasons and make all decisions outside of your emotions. Having the strategy like you mentioned helps. 

Doesn’t sound like greed here. You ran into challenges and need to regroup then continue down your path. Re-evaluate your plan then move forward better and stronger. 

No amount of loss should make you end your life man. Losing and failure is apart of life. I know first hand i spent the past year doing card counting in blackjack also called Advantage play. ( AP ) I’d be up $8k then down $5k ( real numbers ) in a matter of minutes at times. I’ve lost my whole bank rolls a total of 4 times. One was $16,000 at its peak i had built from $8k. 

A few months prior to this endeavor I started learning and doing personal investing. Got connected with great professional subscriptions, learned a lot from the free learning I had access to from the company my 401k is with. Made some great picks that i was waiting to play out until I decided to be a card counter. Sold all my positions to fund a small starting bankroll. The stocks I had done so much research on and bought have doubled and tripled since while I’ve been using the money I did have invested to basically gamble but with a slight advantage. I had a 100 shares or more in PSTG, LMB, CLS at November last year. Would have been big easy gains while I was instead at a casino for hours on end. Even if the stocks didn’t do as well I still would have saved so much time and energy with the effort i put into AP. I recently and thank God decided to hang it up, bought back my stocks ( though at the much higher prices ) and added more big gain potentials like RKLB. CLS is still increasing by the way. I’ve already profited on it in the past few weeks. 

It’s not that i lost my whole BR playing blackjack. Just woke up one day a few days after a moderate down swing and didn’t have the desire to do it anymore. I started investing again a few weeks prior. It’s not like i’d made it big there. 
Realized the big difference between gambling and trading/investing through this journey. There’s a big one don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. 

Can only move forward, learn from the experience and make better investments. Not once did I lose and think about ending my life. That doesn’t mean I liked it though. Just motivated me to do better next time. 

Sounds like you are on a good path with trading and need to figure out how to generate more capital. I’m trying to do the same thing wanting to buy more stock when good buying points come along. Could have used the 25k I’ve lost at the casino. Can’t go back though. Only fortunate it wasn’t more honestly. 

Take your challenges from a perspective of learning, regroup and continue forward, evaluating along the way listening to your emotions and responding after logical evaluation of them.; I would not recommend going into the forex industry it’s so full or rubbish and is the most efficient market in the world meaning it’s also the hardest to make money.

Whilst I was nomadding I met a guy from a more economically challenged region outside of Europe who had managed to get a two year study visa for Italy. In your case it wouldn’t matter so much what the qualification was, as the main thing is that it would get you an opportunity to possibly work at least part time for a couple of years in a stronger economic area. This would give you the means to get your laptop and save a small amount of starting capital. Not sure if that’s something available to you, but thought it would be worth a mention.

My advice would be to stay away from “get rich quick” schemes and get a proper job. Slowly save some money aside to invest and try to focus on stocks, not cryptocoins because in real life, not much appreciates from $50 to $150 overnight. These are pump & dumps and they do exist in the stock market too.
Be realistic.
What you lack in capital, you have in time. You have tens of years ahead of you to compound your earnings, be smart and you can get rich - but not quick.

This is enough to become profitable. Dont use news to influence ur decisions. 

And since u r in a very poor situation, financially, don’t try to make it ur career. Study on the side. It will take a couple years longer but u won’t think about committing suicide. Cuz u will be failing a lot. Even with right education. So dont give false hopes to ur parents and don’t disappoint ur father.

I understand that u r a young maximalist and dont want to be a 9/5 er for pennies. But unfortunately this is a brutal career.

U won’t be able to cut corners like whatsoever. It’s impossible.

And u will be losing money till the very last day before u become competent enough.

214,Should I change my investment mix?,"I currently have about $35k in an HYSA @4.1%
About 21k in investments, about $7k of which is ETFs, rest are crypto($5k) and individual stocks. Some like META, JPM, APPL etc and some terrible penny stock picks. 

I think I should restart investing in VTI, but probably wait a couple months for market correction?

Also, I have about $282k mortgage (7%) should I instead dump my savings towards my mortgage ?
I do have some money set aside in checkings in the meantime 

Edit - M 27, 7% mortgage rate",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gupo84/should_i_change_my_investment_mix/,4,2024-11-19 06:07:52,"Finance major here, I would only consider placing savings into your mortgage if it was a higher interest rate than you’re comfortable with paying. As for the HYSA you don’t need to save so much unless you genuinely have $35k in expenses over 6 months if you were to lose your job tomorrow.

I would consolidate the portfolio to make it super simple (no more than 3-5 stocks/funds and then make sure you have things setup in a Roth IRA or 401k so you’re getting tax benefits as well.

If you’re burning money in penny stocks, go ahead and cut the losses. Nobody got rich by giving away money.; Not really enough information. Age. Interest rate. Returns. 

I would compare returns to SPY and then if you are not beating it just be it. 

I can say I invest in SPY and QQM mostly. I switch the mix on how I see and feel the market.; it seems like your investment mix could use some adjustments. waiting for a market correction before investing in vti could make sense, but timing the market is risky. if you believe in the long-term growth of vti, dollar-cost averaging might be a better approach to reduce risk over time. as for crypto and penny stocks, they’re high risk; maybe consider reallocating some of those funds into diversified etfs like vti or voo for stability.

regarding your mortgage, it depends on the interest rate. if your mortgage rate is low (below 4-5%), it might make more sense to keep investing rather than paying it down, as market returns could outpace your mortgage rate. however, if the peace of mind from paying off debt matters more to you, allocating some savings toward the mortgage isn’t a bad move. just ensure you maintain an emergency fund in case of unexpected expenses.; Do you live in a state with no state tax?; nah, stick with ur current mix bro; [removed]; Nah stick with your current mix man 👨 I AM NOT A BOT; 
My Mortgage interest is 7%. I can make do, but more equity is always preferred, right? 

So suggesting move the HYSA to something like maybe VTI or SPY ?

Those penny stocks are already gone, nothing left worthwhile to cut losses. 
I may consolidate into limited blue chip stocks though!  
Thank you for toy analysis and feedback!; Crypto, I have BTC and ETC. I think I can handle that risk appetite. Penny stocks is something I am already burnt on. If I sell, best I get is the loss. Ao that doesn’t really affect a whole lot. I already consider all of that as gone. 

Guess I will wait a little bit to add more to VTI or SPY. 

My mortgage is 7%. Unfortunately, there’s no knowing when and if I will be able to refi. I do have an emergency fund for 6 month in a separate checking account. Everything in HYSA is just that. Savings. I am conflicted if I should be leaving this there or move it to mortgage. Mortgage payment might reduce about 5 years of my mortgage. 

Another option I just thought -should I buy down points and look for a 4% mortgage?; Yes!; bots are out of control; I would consider analyzing a 6 month expense report for your current household and then setting that as your target savings. Keep in mind your HYSA will need to be calculated using Real Rate and not just whatever it’s offering. So if it’s 4% and inflation is 4% as well (CPI data for research) then you’d need to adjust.

Keep SPY or VOO (not financial advice) in an investment vehicle that can provide the best tax benefits. Don’t be the person who holds it in an individual brokerage account and then loses 40% of it 30 years later due to taxation.; Ok, I was gonna suggest tbills as they don't have state tax but if you are already living in a state with no state tax you don't have to go that route.; How would you lose 40% of it 30 years down the road?; What types of investment vehicles?; Taxes. They’re saying use tax deferred accounts first. I max mine before even thinking about personal brokerage"
215,I think my friend sold me my calls on $SMCI,"I swear on my mother’s eyes. I’m sitting there like a fing genius looking at my hood gambling account, staring at the SMCI chart and reading all this bullshit regards are spewing on twitter about the stock getting delisted. Luckly, I just came out of a similar trade on B.Riley and kinda figured if those frauds can get away with not filing financials on time for over 180 days and they are still trading, there is no way SMCI will get delisted.

I buy 250 $34.5 strike weekly calls on SMCI at $0.50 a pop. That’s a \~$12,500, baby position babbyyy. Why $34.5 calls? idk whats funnier than $34? $34.5. Also I looked at where it dropped when EY announced they wouldn't proceed as their auditors amd $34.5 is about the level they closed at that day. Finally, $34.5 is within my personal risk tolerance. guh

Today, I’m minding my own business, scrolling Reddit, eating a sandwich, watching Ana De Armas AI Porn, minding my own business. My phone buzzes, and it’s my buddy. This guy texts me out of nowhere, “Man, I think I’m fucked. I sold $34.5 naked calls on SMCI this week. Thought it’d be easy money.”

So I’m like, waiiiiiiiiiiiiiit.. I check my broker app and look at the open interest on these contracts, and my jaw hits the goddamn floor. The open interest is 257. lol. **257 contracts**, and your boy here owns **250** of them. I’m the goddamn other side of his trade! I'm the guy that said yuuuuuuuuuup I'll take those off your hands sir. 

If everything holds up and SMCI opens strong tomorrow, this guy is about to be bent over a financial barrel, down 500% at open (das what the app is saying rn at least). He thought he was playing it safe, slinging naked calls like he’s DFV or something, and now he’s unknowingly writing me a fat f\*\*\*ing check for $62,000 (so far).

He knows I bought SMCI calls. I mentioned it in passing, like, “Yeah, I’m in on SMCI this week.” But he doesn’t know **how many** or **what strike**. I didn’t tell him I went full-blown degenerate with $12.5K on a strike so far out of the money.

Now I’m sitting here, “Do I tell him?” Like, “Hey bro, funny story, you’re about to owe me your next three paychecks because I’m holding all the cards—and by cards, I mean your fuckiing calls.” Or do I keep my mouth shut and let the market gods do what they do? I feel bad, but not that bad, you know? Trading is a tough game isn't it? No mercy.

So that’s where I'm going to hold a little past open and then I’m cashing in big-time, and he’s gonna be selling plasma to cover his losses. What would you guys do? Do I come clean, or let him find out the hard way? Either way, I’m buying a steak dinner tomorrow. Maybe I’ll even let him smell it.

And he really thinks he holds the cards as if he’s going to exercise the calls, someone tells him that if he wants to screw his friend HE IS THE ONE WHO HAS TO PAY 865K to buy the stocks that his “friend” would owe to deliver. So basically OP needs to have 865K to make his friend be in debt for 865K.

There's your update.; IMO, deeper analysis here... the company's management is kinda regarded. They made some regarded mistakes and Hisenburg Research regards picked up on it and dropped a short report. Then after a few months, EY, their regarded auditors finally gave up because management got much more regarded then how much regarded money they were being paid. So they dropped them as a client. All of this combined at the same time results in a negative 80% drop from the highs. Rumours on regarded twitter started circulating that SMCI would go bankrupt because they had a covenant on 1.7B of notes that required them to stay listed. If they got delisted, those become due immediatly. It was a regarded shit storm of fear that was being swooshed by people who don't really understand markets. Today, they filed an extension and got new auditors who are also as regarded, so we pumped.

This is ChatGpT response:

Here’s my response:

You absolute legend. Your friend just got WSB’d, and you’re sitting on a golden throne of degeneracy. First of all, props for throwing $12.5k at weekly calls like you’re playing roulette at the MGM Grand instead of trading stocks. Real sigma move. Second, the fact that he YOLO’d naked on the same strike is the kind of poetic justice that deserves its own Netflix miniseries.

If you’re asking us if you should tell him, the answer is obviously no. This is WallStreetBets, not “WallStreetHugsAndSupport.” Let the man learn his lesson the hard way—through pain, regret, and a margin call he’ll tell his grandchildren about. Tendies > friendships.

But when you cash out, you gotta do it with style. Invite him to that steak dinner. Order the tomahawk. Wash it down with a bottle of overpriced Cab Sav. When he’s sweating over his grilled cheese because that’s all he can afford now, lean over and say, “Man, this dinner is on someone special. Really special.”

And the hooker? Yeah, she gets upgraded to the penthouse. You’re a capitalist king now. Don’t waste it.

Hold to the moon, brother. And when you cash out, don’t forget to post the gains porn. We’ll be here cheering you on, drunk on leverage and bad decisions.

TENDIES NEVER SLEEP 🚀🚀🚀; https://preview.redd.it/5t0svcot8v1e1.png?width=521&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee3b680d2adc054a82405e7c57c847f42962d782; But thing is, OP can only screw the other guy if he exercised it for $865K. But OP can’t exercise it. So if if it works which won’t work SMCI is screwed. OP has to sell it cause he can’t exercise it so makes some gains and the seller loses the premium and that is it. 

Nonsense post

and yeah some brokerage just let long rich customers sell naked calls. But robinhood doesn’t even have level 4 that allows naked positions. So OP is lying to his teeth.; Your friends sound lame and boring; Robinhood isn’t the only broker regard.![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); Assuming that was their only trade; Facts idk why he even considers him his friend speaking like this.; okay true im off the gain high rn gotta settle down that was uncalled for; I kind of want to watch when OP sells at open while hes with his friend and his wife. In the bed. Right before he drives his friend to Wendys for the night shift.; thats actually a hilarious idea; The half of the calls were $7500? So how much did you leave on the table; Why not sell those and buy more OTM contracts?; I do have 10k that I've been looking to invest. 🤔; It is an assumption, true. Here's the absolute best case scenario for OP:

According to thinkorswim, no contracts traded at 2.45. only 2 contracts traded at a high of 0.94 at the open, and a couple more at 0.65. By 4 mins later it had already dropped below 0.5.

OP got another chance to close out above 0.6 between 9:53-10:00, where 37 contracts traded. His most likely exit (if he's smart enough to have exited, which I doubt) was at 10:01, at 0.49 (3,966 contracts traded).

If you run all those numbers, OP sold 43 contracts at a decent profit and 207 at a minor loss. AT BEST, he made $650 (and again, that's assuming he's smart and fully exited this shitshow of a gamble, which he very likely did not).; These calls didn’t have volume anywhere near 2.45.; no still needs to get approved, so it is sketch. NASDAQ can still come back and say no.; It seems they have filed a compliance plan with NASDAQ as well, which also had a major reason for the price of SMCI stock jumping after hours; Even if he does exercise, unless his friend holds all 257 contracts (which was not clear from the post) option assignment is random so it might not be his friend anyway.; u really spent all that time writing that soapbox essay just to make us feel bad about a LAWYER?; Then what’s your next trade to take money from the lawyer?; Gold; I mean, it’s pretty solid.; You pay for trades?; On everythimg dude got some serious envy; I left 15 calls open. They are worth $7700 rn but I’ll let them ride; I think it’s more like, they hired BDO who has yet to review the materials presented by SMCI which were not appropriate for EY. BDO may work with them, and they all have relatively negligible behavior in their past.; He said he got 250 of them in the post.   And if its itm, they will eventually be exercised no matter what unless the holder really fucks up.  Ussually a market maker will buy and exercise them if no one else has on the last day. Algos do it; You felt bad?!; 2usd to buy, 2usd to sell

Brokers don't work for free you know; Friends a lawyer making good consistent money + hot wife. You can tell he’s ready to “stick it to em” and screw him over. Envy’s a b*****; That's not what the post says at all. The post says OP owns 250 contracts and that the open interest was 257. His friend could've sold anywhere from 1 to all 257, and market makers covered the rest. You're _assuming_ that OP is _assuming_ his friend sold all 257 contracts, but that's not explicitly stated anywhere.

>>Usually a market maker will buy and exercise them.

That's not how it works. The _Options Clearing Corporation (OCC)_ will automatically exercise any open contracts that are ITM after expiration. Before expiration, American options can be exercised at any time by the party that owns the contract. The OCC will then pick, at random, a broker who holds short contracts. That broker will then pick (likely also at random) which of their clients with open contracts gets assigned. So 3 things can happen: 
1. OP's friend closes his short contract before OP exercises, so it won't be his friend who gets assigned.
2. OP's friend still has open contracts, OP exercises, OP's friends does NOT get picked by the OCC. OP's friend doesn't owe him anything.
3. Same as #2, but OP's friend gets picked by the OCC.

Only in scenario 3 is OP's win coming directly from his friend’s loss.; Mine does schwab; All for it, just hope he remembers karma & the lawyer dont come fuck his life up😂😂; He states that he knows the guy is in those contracts for 62,000 loss as of now.; Dudes sick in the head for 62k and some puss 🤣🤣; He did say that, but he also said so much intensely dumb shit in that post that unless he explicitly states that the friend told him he shorted 257 contracts, I can safely assume he doesn't know and is just assuming his friend was the entire 257 open interest.; That man is starving . For some used friend pussy too lmao . I never been a fan of sloppy seconds but hey thats life not everyone got the same taste"

What impact does ""censorship"" or lack of it have on the bottom line? What would they tell Google to stop doing that would cause the stock to drop? Or Meta, MS, etc.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thinking_face_hmm); Twitter, DJT merger coming; Incredible that no one has addressed the flawed premise here: private businesses can kick you out of their storefront if they don’t like the words you are saying. That’s not a violation of any right to free speech, because the *government* must allow you to speak freely, not a business.; Last I checked there were more than 160 million eligible voters in the US. Silence is complacency; This guy has made it his personal crusade to ban TikTok. I wonder how this is gonna go. 

I’m gonna keep adding meta and google but i guess maybe some snapchat leaps; America is becoming a corrupt oligarchy. However, if a ruler backs only one or two minor oligarchs and persecutes the largest ones, he will fall.

Press barrons were traditionally the kingmakers, but now its the internet barrons.

You might be watching how the next rotation takes place because this is the kind of stuff that creates it

A lot of Wall Street is a fashion show and need I remind anyone about Microsoft and forever 30. How many of you remember the 2000s? After the dot com crash. Microsoft keeps growing, PE compresses, shares go nowhere for years and years and years; Project 2025 contributor who wrote about how he'd run the FCC. It's in there in case anyone wants to know what to expect.

Edit for error; By censorship he means him and his friends can’t be nazis on those sites and social media platforms and it’s making them have feels.; I’m v confused - what is it that they are censoring?; Next two years are going to be an absolute disaster.; How do you trust a guy who chooses those glasses out of all the possible options.; This is Trump building the great firewall stealing the idea from China. The whole plan all along is to censor all speech that doesn't ideologically support Trump. While being intentionally vague about what his censors will allow. All the while calling it freedom of speech. Really couldn't get more Orwelian and dystopian if they tried. And they sure are trying. Welcome to the fascist dictatorship America, you voted for it. Rest easy now, you'll never need to vote again.; Puts on social media. Pox on humanity.; “end the regulatory onslaught that has been crippling America's Job Creators and Innovators” code for the law is effective.; Regards/rebards/restarts run the White House now I guess…; Stocks still go brr; So could this guy just ban all social media platforms??? If so, I could get on board with that; It'll just be business as usual. Big Tech's moats are untouchable and they've captured their regulators.; Trump hates them because they used ban him across the board. I say fuck it. Trump only have 4 years and these big tech's gonna be around even after Trump dies. So I'm just gonna go full autism and bag hold my stocks.; And there goes our unrestricted access to the internet.; Censorship is hard to quantify.

Carr has also stated one of his priorities is to repeal Section 230. This will require big tech to regulate speech on their platforms or be liable for what is said there. That would result in countless lawsuits and the need to hire massive amounts of paid to staff to help moderate even with ai assistance.; Strongly worded post from Mr orange that could imply penalties of some sort will work just fine. 

Remember when he spent all that time trolling bezos and Amazon for absolutely no reason? He’s that petty.; Lack of moderation of advertisements could cause credibility of Google / Facebook ads to fall. This could hurt their overall ad business very badly.; I mean Twitter basically got rid of all its guardrails and its value plummeted because it became a cesspool and many advertisers and users pulled out; it means allowing the right wing propaganda machine to broadcast hate speech on private platforms. it further gives them more power to misinform folks (and thus votes); Not sure how this impacts the bottom line, but I’d be curious to see if there is a shake up with advertising.; They want “free speech” like X, basically just turn everything into propaganda; The cries over ""censorship"" is just the rights persecution complex on full display; Not stop doing, start doing. IE “boost trump to top always or be regulated into oblivion.”; Hmmmm sooo anything not X (Twitter)??; At a minimum, every email and call they have to field about it or accreditation they have to achieve will cost them money. 

Just having someone show up to check that all the tires are inflated will add a cost. There’s probably tons of cost with introducing and adhering to any oversight which is what that statement sounds like it’s planning on doing: overseeing.; Oddly enough the government would be censoring those companies if they dismantle them.  They each have the right to allow or disallow any content they want to on their sites.; If they take freedom of speech out of the hands of the tech companies, advertisers will just stop caring and advertise to everyone, then everyone wins; They about to call it DJTX

The constitution assumes free speech is the default position and the only thing the government can do is *not* allow you to speak freely, which is why the law is written to *forbid the negative* (legal abridgements of freedom of expression in general are forbidden) rather than to *allow the positive*.; Was just about to say that; i mean, they're simultaneously threatening to punish journalists for ""defamation"" of Trump. this has never been about free speech. it's about ensuring the free flow of misinformation.; Nah if you don't do what the person wants then they'll take you to court and force you to make their gay cake even though it goes against your religion


Remember you can't say certain words because it's protected speech, regardless of whether the people you're are referring to even live in the same state as you; *213 millions; I don't think it should be banned, but TikTok (and youtube shorts, anything else similar) are something that PARENTS should be taking a very close look at. I would never allow my child access to that type of content, it is literally just brainrot garbage and I think in 30 years it will be something viewed as worse than cigarettes as far as child development. It is a massive problem that we have not truly felt the effects of yet as a society.

This is not what he has stated.

Is a very stupid way to say “reform section 230”. His subsequent statements on it are pretty vague. Basically he wants it to be favorably interpreted for protection of user content but unfavorable in cases of censorship actions? Seems untenable. 

He does have some good ideas though: 

Refunding “Rip and Replace” to eliminate Chinese made equipment on government networks will be a boon to Cisco and Palo Alto among others. 


He implies increased cooperation on 5g spectrum use intra-agency. Possible boon for ASTS.

Lastly he mentioned Star Link and Kuiper could “end the digital divide”, which I take as DC doublespeak for maybe subsidizing it in rural areas?; Thanks for your submission!

r/WallStreetBets is ultimately a community about making money through trading, and our conversations should shift around that.

Politics are fundamentally intertwined with making money, and political actions almost always have an impact on financial markets.

Still, we need to make sure that when we have these discussions, we're explicitly calling out the financial impacts of the politics we're discussing. Otherwise, the conversation can very easily veer off into flamewars and boring, unproductive, discussion.

Here's an example of a political comment that doesn't offer any value:

* ""I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. What a fucking idiot""

Now compare it to this:

* ""I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. It threatens the profit margins of oil companies because they will need to expand their OpEx. I have calls on Shell that are going to get decimated at open.""

The latter is significantly more interesting and offers a great jumping point into market related discussion.

Put succinctly: If you choose to start or engage in arguments about libtards or Nazis instead of making fun of their bad SPY long then you're in the wrong place and we'll show you the door.

If you're not sure if your content is political, it probably is, and there's probably a better way to post it without making things weird.

217,QUESTION: Warren Buffet annualized returns without Apple?,"warren buffet has an average annualized ~20% return for over the last 5 decades. BUT what would be his adjusted average returns if he never invested in apple? I’m curious to know how key apple was to his success. 

I have been trying to google all morning for this, but google’s search engine only shows recent articles about how warren buffet has dropped apple from his portfolio. I’m sure there’s a study or article somewhere that’s done the math? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gu76al/question_warren_buffet_annualized_returns_without/,100,2024-11-18 16:23:18,"While Berkshire's long-term performance has been stellar, there's evidence of underperformance in more recent years:

From 1965 to 2002 (a 38-year period), Berkshire's compounded annual return was 25.66% compared to the S&P 500's 10.02%.

However, from 2003 to 2022 (a 20-year period), Berkshire slightly underperformed the S&P 500, delivering a 9.75% compounded annual return compared to the S&P 500's 9.80%.

I believe AAPL was added in 2016.

Can't add my source for this due to domain - search ""Warren Buffett Has Underperformed the Stock Market for the Last 20 Years
Rishit Jain
BumpedIn / ISB / CFA
Published Apr 27, 2023""; It’s important to note, because I feel like this is kind of an attempt to discredit him, that managing other people’s assets needs to take a more conservative approach than just yolo-ing the clients’ money into the S&P 500.; Always remember that Berkshires portfolio has grown far too large for Warren to make positions in companies he would love to make , he has stated this many times for years , they are restricted to mostly big blue chips . Also I think warrens approach to Berkshire evolved from beating the sp500 to being a great steward of other people’s money .; I don't get it. Why not search what he would've annualized if you picked out his worst investment? Such a useless hypothetical. What's in the portfolio, is in the portfolio.; This is silly

You can’t just throw out one of his most successful stock picks; Were Buffett and Munger really ever as good as they were touted to be or were they just products of opportunity to begin with? Anyone who started investing when they did would have had the opportunity to buy all these blue chips in their absolute infancy and realize 1000+% gains when hardly anything in the world existed. They lived through the golden age of invention and capitalism.; Impossible to tell: If not AAPL it would have been another (likely great) company they would have put their money into...  It would not have been treasury bonds.  But still, I get your question.... It's hard to know exactly because it looks like they bought and sold AAPL multiple times...; He just acquired Apple recently considering this is over 50 years. I don’t think Apple would account for half of the gains. My guess is 15%; [deleted]; Warren Buffet doesn’t make any picks.  It’s not 1990; He makes like $750 Million a year in Coca Cola dividends alone; It doesn’t matter because if he hadn’t invested in Apple, he would have invested in something else. What if he had done something that’s performed better than Apple?; Keep in mind he's been something like 20%ish bonds as well. In theory, they should potentially be compared to an  80/20 portfolio.; Mr. Buffett and Munger did a fantastic job when Berkshire was a relatively smaller large cap.  At the start of 2003 it had a market cap of $104 billion.  The law of large numbers started to kick then for a modestly growing company.  It is remarkable that with it's huge size, Berkshire has been able to be so close to the S&P 500 since 2003.  But if you are looking for future outperformance, you need to look elsewhere.; gotcha. thank for the search term, interesting read.; He sold off TSMC in mid-2023, when it was around $90-100. So, fact that he sells, doesn't mean, it's a dud stock. I'd still hold onto Apple. 

He bought ULTA in mid-2024, around $400. It's been meh-stock so far. Frankly, he's losing it.; Cherry picking tech bottom


If you use when bro bottom in 2000... Then it's 10.7 for brk and 7.7 for spy....; Yeah and the funds goal may not even be beating the S&P500 I dont know what the goal is, but im sure it aint beating it. 

Some people care about beta and sortintino and drawdowns and volatility or whatever the hell else. Personally I just care if im beating the S&P500 or not.; He is not managing other people money. It is a float for Insurance businesses. Berkshire is not asset management, other insurance companies more or less invest mostly in Fixed Income.

I am not sure what the hell everyone around here is talking about. Berkshire delivers consistent returns on equity, which is what matters; It's of course hard, when you are big, and you still try to avoid most tech stock, which are the majority (or very large) position of the available stocks to invest.; The issue is it supposedly wasn’t his pick. If the majority of his gains aren’t from his own brain, that matters.; After adjusting Buffet's stats, removing outliers to project the future, he heavily regresses to around the level of 2018 Kramer.; 1.1B / $26.82 (apple price 2016) * 228.82 (apple current price)
= 9.38B

during that time Berkshire went from $194k to $706k. 

I’m not sure I follow.. now what?; This is the key distinction that everyone is missing.  On a risk adjusted basis, BRK is practically untouchable.; Not even close, Berkshire currently only holds $16 Billion in Bonds so 1.6% of it's $1 Trillion market cap. BRK's cash position is nearly 20 times the size of their bond holdings.; Cherry picking tech bottom


If you use when bro bottom in 2000... Then it's 10.7 for brk and 7.7 for spy....; But why are you cherry picking the bottom of the dot com crash? That will give so the best looking number possible ; I followed him with OXY and am hurting because of it.; He missed many of the tech gains that drove the S&P 500 over the last 20 years because of his long time aversion to tech stocks… he was somewhat late to Apple, but still in time to rack up massive gains from it.; I almost bought ulta when he did. It’s in the 350’s now. I do still believe it’s undervalued but being right at the wrong time is the same as being wrong.; It's about risk management. When the S&P500 returns -50%, Berkshire will return -15%.; The goal is consistent growth.; Yeah, I shouldn’t have made him sound like a fund manager, he’s not directly managing people’s money. But I think that’s being pedantic about the idea being conveyed. He’s not trying to maximize his gains, he’s trying to keep a healthy balance of minimal losses and healthy gains.; But if he's going to die soon, isn't it good that he trusts his managers to make good picks? I still don't see the issue; Doesn’t matter. He is the one that had to make the final decision; You can’t throw out outliers. Buffet is all about outliers. He doesn’t believe in diversification.; Sorry, I changed my response as I saw they bought on several occassion so we would need the full list of their transactions.  I'm not even sure if that's public information.; You're looking at the wrong thing. I think that's their operating cash for their core businesses or something. They have ~272 billion cash/equivalents total.

>Cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills (in millions): $271,835 [on page 37](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/qtrly/3rdqtr24.pdf)


If you were looking at their financial statement on yahoo finance or something, you need to add and subtract a few different numbers (not sure which ones), but one I know you have to add is ""Short Term Investments Available for Sale"" 288,031,000 (the short term treasury bonds, in thousands, aka 288 billion, which is buried under total assets->investments->...).; Why would you invest in an individual pick instead of BRK? I bought BRK and have done well, but I would never buy one of his individual picks. BRK gives you access to BRK's private businesses.; Show me a person who overperformed qqq without riding one, magical stock. 


Predicting long-term success of technology companies seems to be impossible. ; He bought Apple at like 11 PE.; I don't understand this, even since people are cherry picking the bottom of the dot com bust as the time frame.


Bro bottomed in 2000, spy in 2003


I'd bet if you change the timeframe to 2000 brj has outperformed ; He (or probably Ted or Todd) sold it in the last quarter; the beta is like .86 right now which means it's 86% as volatile as s&p; This was like 10+ years ago. I’m not arguing either way, just stating why it’s brought up. He’s clearly smarter than me 😂; Oh, well then. Shoddy here knows how Buffett operates 😂; It wasn't a huge position. I have BRK and BLK in that segment.; Follow up - not too bullish with news like this  
[Warren Buffett Breaks 6-Year Streak, Doesn't Buy Back Berkshire Shares Despite $320B Cash Pile : r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gut0us/warren_buffett_breaks_6year_streak_doesnt_buy/); All of it?; I don't have time to look it up, but I have to assume that's the beta of it's investment portfolio, it's also sitting on a quarter trillion in cash, which is FAR less volatile than the S&P.; Beta isnt always in correlation to the S&P500 it could be anything else.

Also how is it .86 I thought they were mostly cash? Maybe im mistaken.; You seriously think Buffet would allow one of his generals to buy $50 billion in Apple without final approval from Buffet.; Almost; I looked it up: reduced 96% of the position; Wow I’m surprised. They only held for a few months then took a loss? Must be for tax loss harvesting purposes, but I’ve never known Berkshire to hold for that short of a time frame."

Calls on popcorn!; So Republicans are anti-regulation except when they’re pro-regulation, got it; For some reason I bet twitter will be exempt from his policies; Lol. ""The censorship cartel"". That's just code for ""I want neo-nazis to be able to speak their minds without getting banned.""

At the end of the day if he actually succeeds in forcing social media networks to let Nazis (and similar far-right grifters like Steven Crowder) on their platforms... advertisers will flee and everyone who isn't an asshole will hate going on them. Which is what happened to Twitter.

It's also worth noting that top performing pages on Facebook are almost universally right-wing jerks like Ben Shapiro and Dan Bongino. Youtube is well known for sending people down the incel/manosphere/""libertarian""/far-right rabbit hole.

These people are unfathomably dumb.; Thought y’all want small government?; I thought project 2025 wasn't their policy!; Fuck this man. I just bought a ton of Google on Friday. What happened to politicians that support free markets?; Doubt he's gonna do real harm to these companies. Probably gonna crack down on whatever this kook defines as ""woke"", force them not to ban hatespeech and such (see his quote in the post), but I doubt he'd break anything up.; They don't like it when their nazi friends are banned from facebook or X.; Putin’s plan is to just make the government into a complete monkey shit fight that’s all over the map. My fear is that this time Porkenfuhrer will get *competent* who really do dismantle the government. 

The Russian minister of whatever the fuck who talked about Trump’s “obligations” said the quiet part out loud. Trump isn’t president, Putin is.; The megacaps would be able to survive any volatility caused by the trump admin during the next 2-4 years; Not surprising - I think this is more about being pro-Musk than it is about anti-big-tech.

He's the one that accused the Biden administration of using regulators to target Musk's companies and has generally been critical of any time the FCC seems to be in SpaceX's way.; Meta has been complying with Project 2025's wishes already by not taking disinformation spreading seriously. Zuck's a tool of the right just like Elon - he was caught red handed via the cambridge analytica scandal.; I imagine they’ll try to apply their book ban logic on content producers. That’d be real interesting for their existing libraries and pipelines.; Trump only has 4 years.  That's not enough time to damage big tech.; Finally - get rid of this cancel culture. ; [removed]; Regulation is for those industries and corporations they don't like.; “Ramaswampy”

Interesting, I’ve been calling him Ramascummy. Can’t decide which one I like better.; Ya but big tech does need to be taken down a notch. I hope reddit is on top of the pile frankly. The censorship created by mods on this platform should be illegal. 

I get that some subs are just whatever and who cares if you get banned from it but r/ city / state / province / country are legitimate places to communicate with your peers and getting banned for having a conservative opinion under the guise of “brigading” is nonsense.; Only to be expected, big tech is alt left and heavily censor right wing rhetoric; [removed]; Pro regulation for other people, anti regulation for us.; We're moving to the regulation for thee but not for me phase of the transition to a corrupt oligarchy. Regulation can be used as a weapon until a handful of corrupt people own literally everything.; Is it pro or anti regulation when your regulation is forcing big tech to regulate less?; They aren't adding any new regulations but forcing a reinterpretation of section 230.; They said BIG tech. Twitter is more like little tech.; project 2025 is a gigantic 900 page manifest of conservative ideas and values. The idea that any conservative government wouldn't reflect at least \*some\* of what's in it is unrealistic

If hundreds of democratic politicians and insider came together to write a left wing equivalent manifesto, then some of that would obviously also be reflected in any democratic government; Free market didn’t lobby enough /s; I’d say it’s probably close to 90% that they’ve put in their top for this bull market leg for the Nasdaq to be honest. If not, then maybe it can limp to $200, but I doubt it sees more.

It’s tried to recover, but the way it has traded off a blowout earnings report is just genuinely bad. If the Nasdaq has significantly more in it, I suspect Tesla breaks its 2021 ATH before Google breaks an all time high it set just a few months ago.

It’s a sad state of affairs here.; This won't harm the companies so much as it'll harm a free, civil society. The Project 2025 FCC will essentially remove the guardrails that exist for spreading disinformation, so it can fluourish. The GOP is waging an all out war on truth straight from an Orwell book. They are trying to dumb down the schools and spread constant misinformation so they reduce the critical thinking capacity of the public.; the FCC can not break any company up nor is there any hint of that kind of thing coming from this guy; I mean Europe is a perfect example of how going anti-big tech in your legislation/regulation can backfire.

Long story short, regulations like GDPR to crack down on big tech abuses are quite burdensome. Mega cap companies have armies of lawyers and can still afford to comply to it however. But a startup in the same industry often can't afford that kind of stuff, at least anywhere near as easily as a well established company. 

Yeah Republicans would likely go after big tech for different reasons/in different ways than Europe, but principle still stands. Anything they do to crack down on their industries could end up hurting their competition more.; They go way past banning hate speech they need to be taken down a notch.; The fuck are you yapping about; what about the next 20 years?; Billionaires know they're untouchable and watch out for themselves.; what in the world makes you think he'd leave after last time; Punishing companies that don’t comply with the state’s views on what should and shouldn’t be expressed is just a different form of cancel culture. And with Musk playing an active role in the administration, there’s a conflict of interest at hand. He’d benefit immensely from his competitors being fined or facing legal challenges. I’m really not sure that this will end up how you anticipate it to.; What is your issue with banning nazis and open racists?; Obviously Ramaswampy is better, less letters changed, more clear who you are talking about. Like Repugnican.; Sir, this is a sub where people like making money.; Is X somewhere on that pile of yours or is it only platforms where you don't agree with the consensus?; I would think the billionaire tweaking his own website’s algorithm so that his lies about voter fraud, immigration, and Jews running the planet show up on everyone’s feed would be a bigger problem than the ensemble of power hungry individual loser mods on this much smaller platform but idk 🤷‍♀️; > The censorship created by mods on this platform should be illegal.

""Volunteers have no patience for my nonsense and I'm too lazy to create and nurture a competing subreddit, so I need the government to step in and force those volunteers to work to support the government's view""

sounds reasonable  /s; no it doesnt.; It's pro regulation when it is done selectively based on politics meanwhile a billionaire social media site owner is literally allowed to buy votes.; Is it regulation when you regulate a private business? Yes, unless you are very gullible; sooo is tesla not a faang+ company now...; There are no guardrails to prevent the spreading of disinformation now anyway ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Like, you can make up shit and lie your ass off on Youtube all you want, ain't no one banning you for that. They just ban/delete when it's controversial enough for advertisers to become afraid and I honestly doubt that will change in the next four years. It's probably going to be mostly irrelevant stuff for showmanship, but maybe I'm coping, who knows.; [removed]; Well he literally said they need to be ""dismantled"" so that does seem kinda like ""breaking"" up, right?; It’s my understanding that startups and companies with less than 250 employees and below a predetermined gross income are exempted from GDPR and other regulations to prevent choking small competitors.; A comment history solely made up of Ukraine, Gaza, Covid; Trans!, NBC propaganda machine, etc. Careful, Igor, you are becoming too bold! ; Does it really matter as long as you are not allowed be cancelled for any reason unless you did something illegal. 

Whether companies get fined or not doesn't matter to me.; Throw them in jail if its illegal - if its not , its free speech. 

Free speech isn't conditional and doesn't depend on whether it offends you or not.; Absolutely X should be held to the same account. That said, who is getting banned from X… what censorship is occuring?; Are you talking about bill gates? Cause thats what microsoft and google do as well…

So I guess we are agreed that the problem needs to be fixed? This isnt a dems versus republican issue 🤦‍♂️; [removed]; One layer thinking. ; The new generation of kids will grow up on deepfakes and not be able to tell the difference.

We're doomed!; [removed]; [removed]; He said the cartel must be dismantled, cartels are groups of companies working together to e.g. fix prices and are already illegal in the US under anti-competition laws.  Both in the case of cartels and corporate break ups the FTC and DOJ have jurisdiction there, not the FCC.; You mean… current events 🤡🤦‍♂️; It matters when a political administration decides to selectively enforce it or use it to benefit their allies. Even if you think that the upcoming administration won’t do either of these things - what is truly stopping the next administration after them from using these policies to cancel via punitive fines and legal action?; Banning accounts is old stuff. These days artificially inflating one's personal account and takes is the new meta. Elon has mastered this to perfection.; [removed]; The extra layer is imagining that private interests owe your dumbass regurgitated ideas a platform. Self victimization driven by entitlement, simple as that.; So what does breakup them up mean? In what way are they functioning like a cartel? Where is this cartel cooperation with each other? 

I highly doubt Amazon and Microsoft work on their tech together toward some woke agenda given they're big cloud competitors. Or Microsoft and Google given they're search competitors.

It seems more likely to me he means break up the companies like separate Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and Messenger. Or separate Google search from Android, etc. The individual companies are so large and homogeneous I could see a stronger argument of that being what he means.; It is better than companies arbitrarily canceling individuals based off of public pressure. If you are asking me whether i would like it in the governments hands versus private companies that's the risk i'm willing to take.; [removed]; I mean these companies are accused of a ton of anti-competitive practices by the Biden admin and basically all of them have been or are in the process of being sued by them.  Google and Meta have been found to collude to set ad prices, and Google and Apple are in the process of being forced via litigation to end an anti-competitive relationship (payments for Google search on apple.)

It is bipartisan that these companies are anti-competitive and collude with each other.  But in the sentence where he says break up, and in the Project 2025 document he wrote, he is specifically talking about them colluding to censor and applying section 230 in its direct textual interpretation to make them liable if they continue to censor (since lack of liability for content is based on being neutral per section 230.); The large tech companies are one of the few potential threats to trump's rule. So he want's to weaken them. China went after their big tech stocks a few years back for the same reason.; [removed]; [removed]; [removed]; [removed]"

They had peak 65 million viewers. Buffering issues or not, that’s massive.; They had so many people trying to stream it crashed their service and you think puts are the play?; Maybe a dip but I seriously doubt it causes any real damage. No one cancelled their membership over this and they’ll be able to brag about how many people tuned in. Not to mention they’re broadcasting an NFL game later this year.; Inverse WSB.

When i was waiting for the main fight and saw the ad that they were hosting NFL live now my 1st thought was to buy as I never knew they made that deal; I hope there is a big dip at the open. Easiest buy ever.; NFLX is going to be very green tomorrow. Maybe even +5%. Why? 60 million tuned in, a record. Def will beat new subscription estimates in the coming quarter; Lol no; Delusional people who are thirsty for any news related to a stock to predict a movement often lose money.; How’s crowdstrikes stock? If it’s still fine nothing will happen to Netflix; All I know is calls on CELH; Won't have any effect on the stock. I think longer dated puts still good play given their run up ytd but won't crash due to this one fumble. Crazy that ytd they are significantly outperforming the likes of aapl, amzn, googl and msft. Wtf; If its red, which it could be like any other stock- it will not be at all due to some issues related to a fight that at times had some lag; Its going to be up massively. They showed they could get 120 million people. Thats all the stock will care about.; I'm more baffled by the amount of people who watched it. Like how dumb and bored is the average person?!; Maybe a temporary dip but highly doubtful with expansion to NFL games and weekly WWE programming coming up in January as well; https://preview.redd.it/6wfu6y13bi1e1.png?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e87a8ffc6e1107092e75f145fbfc3f35bfbf6278

The duality of WSB; WSB is bearish about Netflix, time to buy ⬆️; Everyone talking about it means calls.; Either I can't see colors, or it's as green as it can get!; Stupid ass OP lmao, Monday right now and Netflix is at it's all time high and the stock keeps going up by the second. Puts at market open and you would have lost all your money in seconds. Clown; 1738; Honestly seems to be good and bad.

Bad that they can't host such a large scale event.

But now you know 120 million+ people may tune in. Just because they have a subscription and it is free.

Imagine the ads/product placement you could coordinate and create some revenue on top of the subs.; Or they will show how many people tuned into it and show this as a proof of concept for streaming live sporting events and or on-demand events, and this will add to their value; Reports are 100k people filed a complaint about connection issues and 60M people watched...even 10x the connection issues to account for non-filed complaints, 1M issues out of 60M people isnt much...they can get that sorted out; Big Mike A$$ might already save Netflix; Buy the dip, sell covered calls. This will not have any lasting impact to Netflix and you'll make a few thousand before getting assigned.; One of the best Seinfeld moments. So delicious.; No way. Did you even look at the rating and viewers????; They gonna broadcast 2 NFL games in December and start streaming WWE Raw in January. The Jake Paul fight peaked at 65 million views with another 80k+ reporting issues, that’s a huge sign for a merger or partner IMO;  Yeah, phuck that ad revenue and new subscriptions.; If it is, you would be well served to buy the dip. It must have broken every record in terms of viewers than any other sporting event except for maybe the Olympics, but probably more than any single Olympic event.; They got 120M to watcha YouTuber box a senior citizen, seems bullish to me; Oh yes, please make it dip. Will be a huge buying opportunity. 

Yes the streaming was dogshit, but will it affect long term performance? No. 

Furthermore, they still have the NFL and WWE coming, and even though the quality will most likely be the same, the fanbase is addicted enough to watch anyway.

Calls.; I had the DVD mailed to me so I didn't have a problem watching the fight.; ""I don't think you do""😆😂; You guys are high as fuck. No one streamed to 65 million people before. It was a success and it’ll get better; All I know is I cancelled. 

1. Because I got Netflix for this fight

2. Because it's too expensive and I have three other streaming services. 

3. Because there's not much to watch I haven't seen and nothing coming up that I need to see; RIP; Please buy puts. If you think Netflix can't handle it, buy puts. Please stop having your cake and eating it too. No calls.; Pay-per-view has also had viewing issues with major events.  Most people already pay for Netflix and personally I’d rather pay $15 for a whole month of Netflix versus $100+ for one fight on pay-per-view.  Just like when Netflix raises their prices, everyone complains, but no one leaves.; Hmm. This aged well.; Selloff PLEASE!!! Imma just be like ""nom nom nom"" gobbling up shares.; I now realize that the only streaming sports I hate I have successfully watched without all the lag and pixelation is from Amazon for Thursday night football. I am impressed.

Every service that tries to stream a live event over the internet always has this problem if it’s a  high demand event. So watching playoffs or championships have been u watchable in my experience.; NFLX? I have an even larger exposure at the same time for Amazon and Disney as they are correlated as twiddly doo on NFLX, exposure could blow my portfolio to the moon and beyond; but with Netflix making the same mistake over and over again; and neutralized my profits on the HF trade; this is a sure thing.; So I get what people are saying about them adding the new services with live events, WWE content and sporting events, but if they can’t cover one night of Mike Tyson and Jake Paul, what makes you think that in January it’s gonna be so much better that there’s not going to be any buffering issues I don’t think the Internet is ready for live sports events of this magnitude.; I want it to go up so I can buy puts!; love this meme 😂; NFLX should get into the porn streaming business ; Red you say?  Calls it is; Hope so, I'm ready to buy the dip; RemindMe! 15 hours; Honestly, I wish it had completely broken down - would’ve been better than watching that awful boxing match lol; I cancelled my subscription mid fight. It's the first time I've used Netflix this year and everyone at my house said stuttering and crashing was just how it went. I've not had the same problems streaming from a friends Plex server or Hulu when I used that.; Careful with those puts. High demand = calls. Im not doing anything except not cancelling Netflix. 

I was exceptionally pissed during the fight, however.; Should've used Pied Piper.; i don't think it'll matter, it showed the market. it's only gonna increase and improve for the nfl games imo

source: someone that bought and canceled netflix saturday night lol; Doesn’t matter they got the subs for it regardless; Everything before the actual fight was more interesting. That was the biggest pussy ass shit I've ever seen but it's been the thing since Mayweather and Pacquiao. We all knew Pacquiao won but pussy ass mofos will always win because they are weak and have to right shit in their favor and most of the people after the Pacquiao fight do it for the purse rather than for us. Only other person who showed the people the real real was Tommy fury when he fucked up pussy Jake. This white privileged asswipe only got puerto ricos blessing to even be called el gallo but we all know the US doesn't care about them yet they idolize him and allow him to use that like it wasn't anything. If anything they should name him el pinche mierda. That's why latin america people don't respect the puerto Ricans. Sell out like Jake but don't reap any rewards. 

P.S. I know alot of boxing people will say shit but I've watched boxing since I could remember and there's a long list of pos who have damaged its name but have made people pay attention to it, it still doesn't excuse this bs but do as you will and to the Mayweather cock sucker's do as you will ride that pussys dick you won't change my mind no matter what and idgaf. They don't give a fuck and neither will I. Other than that hopefully someone knocks his ass to a pulp one day.; Calls; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276); They don’t run the CDN. Akamai does. You don’t know what you are talking about.; NFLX went on to hit an ATH and ended the day up $22/per share.; lol about that; Netflix is always red; Tbh, Netflix sucks before and after this, only difference is I'm not a bagholder; Christmas game on paramount last year was like 30 million. 

Crazy numbers Netflix semi-pulled off.; It's crazy impressive.

There's a chance Netflix is estimating illegal streams so it's might not be completely accurate but even half that is impressive.; You were right man. It's Monday right now and Netflix right now is at it's all time high and keeps going up even more. i respect you man, OP was being regarded by making this stupid post lmao. It's embarrassing how wrong they were 🤣; You were right man. It's Monday right now and Netflix right now is at it's all time high and keeps going up even more. i respect you man, OP was being regarded by making this stupid post lmao. It's embarrassing how wrong they were 🤣; The stock is going to go higher... they can fix the technical problems... demand is a good problem to have.; lol, exactly; An insane amount of new subs for their first foray into live sports; You were right man. It's Monday right now and Netflix right now is at it's all time high and keeps going up even more. i respect you man, OP was being regarded by making this stupid post lmao. It's embarrassing how wrong they were 🤣; And WWE starts streaming in 2025 on Netflix.  As long as they start ironing out the kinks, they're going to continue to do well; I did, all this did was remind me that I had been paying for it & had not watched anything in months.; Not only did no one cancel, tons of new subscribers joined. Bodes well for their next earnings release.; Is broadcasting NFL game a huge deal?

Cable TV exists.; Uhhh you mean partially broadcast a game? Anything like the fight I might be able to watch one quarter of a game. I gave up even trying to watch the fight. Took me 5 mins of messing with stopping and resetting the app to watch one minute. They should offer customers a free month after such a horrible experience.; This was my take away. The streaming problems were not anywhere near as bad as people are making it out to be. If the numbers are true, 120m+ USA,  280m+ worldwide, then this was an absolutely astonishing success for Netflix. 

If they're able to continue to demonstrate success with live events, especially the NFL, they're going to be in the mix for things like the World Cup and the Superbowl before too much longer.; I canceled my membership; Hell no it wont. Giant proof of concept. 

I also had no buffering issues; It's going to drop in the morning or even the entire day from regarded retails panic selling before hitting ATH every week all the way till EOY. Anything Reddit or public panders about, the opposite happens since they can't see through their bias and emotions.; Whats better buying now and hoping it greens on open or being patient and waiting for open; Should i buy?; I feel seen.; It's up 11% from when it tanked; Celsius short term calls have wrecked my finances. Leaps or March / June calls is not a bad strategy though; ~~at times~~

The entire time; I think so too. Might be a dip overnight to get a discount before open.; Should i buy rn?; Always has been. You wouldn’t even know it’s up like 70% YTD; Yep; OP is like 5 or something and doesn't even know what an option is. ; He must be having a blast in prison; 60 million for the Tyson fight specifically.; It’s unlikely that 60 million tune in to watch WWE.; I will be messaging you in 15 hours on [**2024-11-18 14:43:21 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2024-11-18%2014:43:21%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gtguhx/o_yes_netflix_will_be_red_tomorrow/lxo8qvb/?context=3)

|-|-|-|-|; You live under a rock?; Only the logo; [deleted]; As soon as they announced 65 million watched at its peak, those are Super Bowl type numbers.; I know a few of those ppl. And they’ve already cancelled their free trials. WokeFlix is an L.; Now Im just mad I didnt make any moves on it lol; You should comment this again. I missed most of it the first 3 times.; Yeah but you’re a redditor, you’re the worst litmus for the general public imaginable. Reddit doesn’t understand why people own IPhones.; I pay for Netflix and still ended up just watching some dude on twitch streaming it. He had no connection issue lol only found out from people on Reddit that they were having issues.; It’s only on Netflix pretty sure; I don't have cable. I'm semi-excited to see it on netflix.  I'm not gonna pay $120 a month for CNN/FOX or whatever. Don't care enough about football to pay it but I'd watch it if I have it. Maybe to gamble or just have on... So to me it adds some value that's been lost.; They will try to broadcast*... more like single casting; It’s Netflix exclusive; https://preview.redd.it/15z36dfoaj1e1.jpeg?width=266&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5de5ac8413b27305f3e866212db394daf03c3fdc; Waiting to see if there is a dip prior to open and getting in then.; Approved; Exactly; Well wait until tax loss harvesting is over, then calls; No you’re absolutely right, 10 million though? Did they only have trouble when there was 60m active viewers or was it when there was far fewer? I know they didn’t have 60m viewers for the entire 5 hours of fighting and commentary; Yes, I'm just suggesting their viewership metric might not just be on the platform.

However, I believe it's their on-platform metrics. It's incredible they can handle that traffic.; They still don't know why Trump won; Doesn't mean too much outside the US tbh.; You can get an antenna for like $15 and get basic channels for local NFL broadcasts; Ya I couldn’t believe they interviewed him before the fight while he was naked!! WTF!; Ok me too; Your approval has been rewarded; I think the fact that they didn’t fully go down at 60 million suggests they would’ve been better at 40 million. But who knows when they started struggling. 

They said 50 million watched the Serrano fight. So at least somewhat elevated for the earlier fights.; How would it not be the exact number?; they didn't; That's easy. Trump won because voters are stupid.; Does anybody really know?; Coincidentally the United States has more Netflix subscribers than any other country; Hell if you live close to the broadcast tower a paper clip will work just as good.; Hope you made some money 🙏; Yup; Because if it's not just on the platform, they wouldn't know the exact number, they're estimating.; Only in Reddit can an individual make an observation and be instantly proved right by the moron who thinks he has easy answers for everything.; See? They don't know why trump won.; Ya were garbage just like old Joe said!

https://preview.redd.it/mx2fkmqf7j1e1.jpeg?width=1300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0b250508697ae178df67369e43421b06dd05d903; The comparison on a per country basis is correct, but what the previous user probably wanted to refer to is the fact, that the Netflix subscription basis is larger outside of the US (actually surprising to me, thought Netflix was not that widespread) and that its share of revenue is also higher outside of the US:

Take the win.; Yes, I mentioned that I believe it's on the platform.

I don't have a strong reason to believe otherwise, but Netflix has been known to present viewership information differently in regards to their TV and Movies.; Exactly. It's not my problem that ju5tjame5 doesn't want to hear reality.; Netflix went crazier than i expected; Were they stupid when they voted for Obama too?; Who's they?"

++Capital ->  ++Prices

++Cash -> Lower Prices

Lower Prices -> ++Capital (decrease cash)

Money is not lost. It is transferred.

Debt -> ++Capital (thru interest)

Since cash value depends on prices

Capital is leveraged at risk

Capital includes: salary, stock, property, food, debt.

Cash has no inherent growth or productivity.

Therefore prices move as cash and capital fluctuate

If capital has no inherent growth or productivity, then cash is worthless.

Note: cash transfers increase capital value

Summary: cash savings have no value beyond the capital expenditures. So waiting for prices to drop by holding a cash position without any means of increasing capital is risking current capital opportunities.

|-|-|-|-|; True .. it was based on gold reserves for the longest time

You should look into the biggest holders of crypto though, pretty much banks - the creators of fiat currency.. and of course governments.. that borrow money off banks..

Crypto really isn't the big FU to the system that people think it is.. it is a mechanism; Its value is backed by the government. You have to pay taxes on income with it or you will go to jail.; Listen to this guy, Yul B Alwright; 
It literally just allows you to transfer wealth with a decentralized 3rd party rather than a centralized 3rd party.

People over think the shit out of it, but it’s really quite simple lol. Yes in a perfect world crypto is most definitely not useful at all.

But in a world where governments are ever changing, and there are many fiat currencies that get debase by their government, it has a tangible, easily define-able use.

It really should not even be an argument… I believe in the United States dollar pretty long term. Do I believe in it forever? Eh… probably will be fine fore my lifetime, and potentially numerous after mine.

The point is that it still is at the whims of a government, and while I do not believe GOBeRmEnT BAd, it is simply a fact that over long periods of time this makes fiat susceptible to hyper inflation or other debasement.

Crypto doesn’t care what country you are, or who’s government issues your currency. It’s simple. Bitcoin is not immune to corruption, but on a long time scale it certainly is much less susceptible to it, and significantly more mobile than traditional currencies.

There can be nuanced takes here, but I often feel it has to either be “crypto is a ponzi” or “crypto good government bad”; You know crypto is a lot more than just a means to transfer wealth and money. That's just one aspect of it.; as you said, it was based on gold reserves. but it isnt; and what is happening when your new government will treat it as an asset with value? btw in colorado u can pay taxes already with bitcoins or ethereum since 2022; OOAA OOOOHHHH; And yes banks are the largest holder.

Interesting that wealthy institutions are the largest holder of an asset. Or is that actually just common sense..

If an institution has large amounts of wealth, then it is also more likely to own large amounts of most assets."
223,"r/Stocks Daily Discussion & Fundamentals Friday Nov 15, 2024","This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on fundamentals, but if fundamentals aren't your thing then just ignore the theme.

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

If the S&P fills the gap to the downside, there will be a ton of great stocks at a discount that got disproportionately pummeled by bearish sentiment.; Recommendations for next week:

* **Novartis** - puts, $100 strike, December '24 expiration. Wait until after it breaks the 8-day EMA to the upside.
* **Cigna** - puts, $315 strike, December 6th expiration. After the gap up it was rejected at the 50 and 200 EMA simultaneously. CI is currently sitting at the 8-day EMA. Get in if it breaks and finishes below that point. 
* **Tandem Diabetes** - puts, $29 strike, December '24. Wait for it to finish above the 8-day EMA.
* **Nasdaq Inc.** - calls, $80 strike, December '24. Between November 15th and the 30th, it has gone up 23 years straight for an average of 13.2%.; [deleted]; Thoughts on $META?; SMH on sale; Planning to make my taxable accounts just index and then do individual stocks in my irá in case i need to sell do that im tax efficient; Sunnova is the next SunPower -> $0

Remember Sunpower $SPWR? They filed for bankruptcy back in mid July. I’m here to tell you why Sunnova is next. 
I’ve worked in solar as a sales manager for roughly 6 years. Sunnova has been struggling to pay their dealers/installers all year. Robbing Peter to pay Paul. Sunnova is basically a Ponzi scheme at this point. Search Reddit/facebook groups particularly where solar industry people talk and it’s a pretty open secret. 

“NOVA holds approximately $7.98 billion in total debt. This represents a 25.33% increase over the past year, contributing to a debt-to-equity ratio of 4.58, which is significantly above industry norms”

They currently sit at a $485 million market cap, eerily similar to Sunpower before they went under. It is only a matter of time for Sunnova. Most dealers/installers are moving all of their volume away from using them as they’ve been late on payments. Instead of the reps getting paid upon install, they are only getting paid now once the system is turned on and activated. Sunnova is going to bankrupt a ton of smaller installers who rely on them for a large chunk of their financing. The last thing solar reps want to do is jeopardize getting paid so they are going to pivot away from selling new Sunnova PPAs/loans. 

Sunnova holds an INSANE amount of debt. I honestly have no idea how they are still afloat. I didn’t think they would make it this far at the beginning of the year. Their free cash flow is in the toilet.

“Sunnova Energy International (NOVA) reported a negative free cash flow (FCF) of approximately -$2.13 billion over the trailing 12 months. This figure is derived from an operating cash flow of -$282.75 million and capital expenditures totaling -$1.85 billion. The significant cash burn highlights the company’s capital-intensive business model and its current inability to generate positive cash flow from operations”

I know what you’re thinking, their stock is already down massively since the election. Yes, that was based on all solar stocks dropping. Sunrun (which I believe will be around for the long haul) also dropped like a rock. However I believe within 6 months Sunnova is going to file chapter 11 and go to 0. 
I don’t think trump will kill the solar tax credit. However it wont matter for Sunnova. Their CEO is a former Enron exec. This company is on its last leg and has been raising debt like crazy to stay afloat. Has worked for far longer than it should have. Their partnership with Home Depot has largely been a dud. Nothing like Sunruns partnership with Costco. 

Unless they are able to raise an insane amount of money or interest rates hit 1% in the next 4 months they are fucked and will be sold off for parts.

This translates into growth of worldwide fab capacity in all segments, especially at the leading-edge nodes. This provides a long-term growth opportunity for ASML as we continue to meet the semiconductor industry’s demand for higher productivity, lower cost, and simpler chip-making processes.

Based on the different market scenarios, we believe we have an opportunity to reach annual sales of between approximately €30 billion and €40 billion in 2025, with a gross margin between approximately 54% and 56%. Looking further ahead, for 2030 we believe we have an opportunity to reach annual sales of between approximately €44 billion and €60 billion, with a gross margin between approximately 56% and 60%.""

I’d also advise to put a small-ish percent into some fundamentally strong speculative stocks, it wouldn’t get you life changing money but also wouldn’t hurt; Moves like this usually last longer than people expect. Smart thing to do is stay away from it. It will probably keep rolling over shorts for a while yet.; My rule of thumb is don't short in a bull market, not worth the risk; timing is the impossible part and any gaurantee of profits is already baked into the option price.; I mean I suppose it's better for execs to actually care about shareholders making money if you own the stock. But seems to confirm that a lot of their valuation is smoke and mirrors at this point. I sold 80% of my stake at $60. Will sell the other 20% at $70.; As if there wasn't enough of a red flag with the CEO making statements like ""We absolutely eviscerated this quarter"" and ""The winners in AI will be powered by Palantir and the losers will read analyst notes."" On the earnings call: ""Given how strong our results are, I almost feel like we should just go home"".; Healthy pullback is fine; Markets went down about 9""; You got me curious; Go back to it and look at your stocks EOD Monday.; and you didn't invite any of us, big dawg? smh; Maybe for the inidices but lots of stocks are sold off hard with good buy opps.; Because we are in a market bubble only surpassed by 99 and 29. It's fucking insane.

People buy overvalued shit like PLTR and get rewarded by 60% gains in 8 days. This is fucking insane. I can't use the real word to describe this since it's banned on the sub.

This market has gone full simple jack; only the 95th percentile?

seems low; Repeat after me - “ I will buy into the stocks I have conviction in when mr. Market gives me chances, instead of posting the same rant comment multiple times a day”; Why is RKLB a meme stock? Aren't they one of the only companies to make it into orbit?; RemindMe! 2 months; I bought more $TLT this morning.  The current yield is around 3.95%.  US 20 yr interest rates will get below that rate eventually.  The question is when?  And since I can't time the market, I might as well buy the sure thing which is $TLT that will eventually increase in price while collecting a 3.95% yield until US 10-20 yr rates fall below that level.; Is there a chance it goes to the low 80’s again?; I sold all my RKLB at $15 and regret it now. Had a $3 average too. ;(; I sold all at $15 and regret it now. Had a $3 average too. ;(; if you want AI hardware. go nvda or go home. Buy high sell higher. I sold all my NVDA after it beat AMD in price. AI stock performance recently isn't good.; Nice! I keep checking back and seeing it hit $171 makes me wish I sold a bit later haha but gains are gains.; Who’d have thought that naming a true imbecile to be Sec of Health would be perceived as bad for science-based health companies?; With a 12.9 rsi, at the very least would be surprised if it doesn't bounce soon given how massively technically oversold that is.; This and OKLO since he's a board member.


Might see a quick pump/dump this week but longterm might be good bets.; Super bullish for OKLO, Wright had invested $10M at a very early stage- he’s sold on SMRs and especially their solution, along with Thiel; I'm buying if it goes under $600. It's probably a decent buy now but it's on shaky ground with other AI names at sky high valuations. If there's ever a correction it could get hit even more.; Small-ish position, mostly a hedge against being too exposed in the US stock market. Long term it’s a good hold I’d dare to say; wouldnt mind it pulling back til January; You need at least a 30% pullback for healthy valuations.; Because someone actually bought the Pokemon Greninja ex 214/167 Pokemon TCG Twilight Masquerade Special Illustration Rare card for $329.99 yesterday on Ebay marking the top of the speculative bubble : ); The +23% this year isn't good enough?; Nothing a few million dollars in donations won’t solve; I still don’t see how his appointment affects LLY and NVO in any significant way; I’ve been buying the dip on PFE 🤷🏼‍♂️; If healthcare is going the way of the dinosaur then i guess it's time to sell.  

You can clearly see people freaking out over day to day action.; As someone who invested in them heavily 2019-2023, I'd avoid chip equipment for awhile personally. Lam Research, Applied Materials, ASML, and KLAC all seem primed to see declining growth and shortening backlog the next year or two due to the massive global fab build out we've seen now getting into operation. I also expect China sanctions/tariffs to hit them hard. Foundries (TSM, Intel, Samsung, etc) are probably going to be taking a step back from the massive capex orders they've been putting in to recoup their investments for awhile.; Probably going to be pain until next year. A lot of the chip market for autos and industrials have sucked for the past year. 

Hopefully will rebound next year, but pieces for these companies are actually solid for long term holds. ; Powell said yesterday fed isn’t in a rush to reduce rates; December rate cuts went from 83% to 50s. Powell said economy too strong, will have to wait and watch; Zoom out.; Same, I topped up AMAT, ASML and started a position in LRCX.; That's funny.

Oil & gas pipelines stocks have had a nice bullrun this year.; How is everyone suddenly talking about ONTO. I hadn’t seen that name before and now it appears all the time.; Buy high sell low; The same as what's happening with the majority of the market. If Nasdaq is down 2.2% as it currently is, chances are AMZN isn't green.; RSU vests today. Bulk sell orders bringing the price down. Same with META; Yeah I bought.

It's not like the money is taking a vacation.; [removed]; Not out sourcing all their jobs would help.; Daylight savings; Its November 15; I must be holding the wrong European stocks. NVO, ROG, ASML and AZN are all red.; I'm honestly surprised all the risks from China aren't *already* priced in. You'd think they would be - it's not like the political uncertainty has ever been secret - but I guess the market is still trying to figure it out.; I think CELH could definitely work from here, its just still a big gamble of consumer preferences. You are at least 100% smarter than the momo guys who bought at 90; Classic redditor moves. Stock goes down people think its trash and sell it (see posts around last google dip). Stock pumps and people fomo into it until someone finds the top lel.; AMD is almost there.; Mpwr, although it still looks expensive and their are rumors circulating about their nvda allocation; Axcelis technologies is down like 60% but auto semiconductors need to start recovering before there’s any decent upside.; HITI for me any day of the week; idk, mortgage rates have been going up since the Fed first started cutting rates...if the 10-year keeps going up, homebuilders margins will come into question even more.; Honestly I feel bad for you. The writing was on the wall and the short bounce above $3 was one my best stock option exits yet, especially now with hindsight regarding the bankruptcy.

Your options are currently worth 0, some brokers support selling on OTC markets, not sure about fidelity. Also you have to check the status of the stock on OTC, it might be halted due to the bankruptcy for some time. I would say there will be 0 liquidity for your options anyways. You might have to work with Fidelity directly to sell it.

But to be frank, I am not sure how long dated are the options you are holding, but your only way out is if the stars align and someone buys the company along with the debt, otherwise you are wiped out. Rules of the casino.; Imo Trump is not going to have the effect on oil that he's touting. The real drill baby drill president was Biden. The US is now producing record amounts of oil with falling fuel prices. Oil companies aren't going to produce more and risk another bust situation.; Sorry - the post you're trying to make mentions a stock that currently breaks rule #7.

Any of the following criteria is considered breaking the rule:


* Typically trades under $5 or previously traded under $5 within 6 months

* Below $300 million market cap or previously traded under 300m before the pump within 6 months

* Most OTC / PINK stocks

* Usually has missed reporting/filings; no auditing or odd auditing issues

* Low volume or wide bid/ask spread

* Doesn't have any big name institutional holders

 * If the biggest institutional holder is a stock promoter then they don't count as an institutional holder

* All SPACs

look at sofi as an example - improving fundementals for years, stock goes nowhere. suddenly one additional quarter of the same thing and the stock pretty much doubles. 

why didnt it happen the previous quarters? why didnt stock move up slowly as earnings kept beating? why did it stay pretty much flat?; Because it does that.  

Monday it will be up irrationally as well.; Powell's remarks today indicated the Fed may slow down or halt its rate cut schedule. This alone would not have triggered a selloff except the import price index came in very hot and business inventories were smaller than anticipated. Then there were some of Trump's picks for cabinet positions.; Powell said no rate cuts in December. And some trump picks scared the market. He said he would also remove AI barriers that Biden put in and imposed tariffs so the tech sector is selling off more than the general market; More than that and also qqq puts.; Borderline crashing.

I bought AMZN and GOOG bigly in December 2021 and ok with that today. Probably won’t feel worse.; I wouldn't. If it's getting delisted odds are they're not in good shape. I understand risk/reward, but the risks there, in my opinion, don't justify the potential rewards. SMCI is interesting, but you don't get one of the big accounting firms to dip on you without some serious issues. I'd avoid it.; ASML also just confirmed their 2030 earnings, so the growth is there. I agree, it's going to be painful in the  short to med term, but long term, these are good prices.; Few things. They basically have like no debt and have worked on great acquisitions for the last few years. 

Chip makers are moving towards square wafers and there is a lot of gains happening in the advanced packing market. This is more Onto’s space. 

They’ve also managed the market really well considering industrial and auto market has been in a downturn.

Investors are also nervous about, if their acquisition of Catalent will go through. If it gets blocked, it will set Novo Nordisks ability to ramp up their production back significantly. However, they do have a ""plan b"", whatever that might be..; We don't have a long-term healthy economy. 

During the last two years of Biden's term, the government spent 6-7% of GDP to maintain GDP growth of 2-2.5%. Mind you, governments typically spend 2.5-3% of GDP during recessions as a countercyclical measure. Private sector investment and payrolls have been abysmal during that time, not to mention GO has trailed GDP since 2022. Gross output *front runs* gross domestic product during a recovery.; Trump added 8tr to debt and only 2 tr to GDP. Biden added 8tr to debt, but 8tr to GDP. It's a blowout. Trump performance of 4 to 1 debt to gdp ratio is unsustainable and will collapse the economy. ; .....Trump added 8tr and next to little gdp. Biden done a lot better; It's a revenue problem.  6.4 percent of gdp on discretionary spending us historically low.

Much of that is spent on the military, veterans benefits, etc, which most people wouldn't consider optional.


https://usafacts.org/articles/how-much-of-the-federal-budget-is-discretionary-spending/; I’m about to lose all the gains from him getting elected; We no giant anymore. Our MC is pathetic. Still holding tho.; I've been pretty critical of LEU as not being worth $100 based on fundamentals, but it's starting to retreat back into sensible territory. If it falls below $60 it's worth looking into. Some of the mid-tier and junior gold miners are getting beaten up due to gold price and the failures of the large caps, yet they're still recording record margins and FCF. WDOFF, GAU, SAND, FSM, etc. are trading cheap atm; AEM is woefully underpriced compared to its blowout earnings report. ANET is oversold IMO. Ditto for biotech and health care. 

My main recommendation is to run puts on individual stocks. The weak ones with strong downward trends are going to get destroyed if the indices continue falling, giving you the opportunity to make a lot of money quickly and recycle that cash into the oversold strong ones. My portfolio is flat today but I'm up 3% overall due to fading HSY. u/Deep_CFC did even better.; 5750 is the 50-day MA, 5700 is the pre-election floor, 5400 is the September 6th floor, and 5180 is the August bottom. Given that election FOMO broke the rising wedge pattern that would've led to a normal correction, there's a real chance we break the 50 EMA and the pre-election floor.; None of them have hit their marks yet. 

The market open doesn't factor in.

NDAQ is still fine to enter. It's a long play with plenty of room to run.; When? About a month ago.

Why? Because short-term option trades are among the safest and most lucrative ways of making money *if* they are exploiting the structural makeup of the stock market. This is the opposite of gambling on directional plays or using them to hedge a larger portfolio. Additionally, it allows consistent cash flow to recycle into the main portfolio.

What informs them? The nature of the strategy. All of them - I use 3 to 4 right now - rely on piggybacking off the money flow in stocks/ETFs in different ways. 

Currently I'm selling off some holdings to allocate 30% of the portfolio to options. It will be a substitute for bonds, whose profit factor pales in comparison and returns don't compound.; Always a massive red flag when the CEO of a public company makes statements like ""We absolutely eviscerated this quarter"" and ""The winners in AI will be powered by Palantir and the losers will read analyst notes."" On the earnings call: ""Given how strong our results are, I almost feel like we should just go home"".; What expiration?; Like Instagram and Whatsapp? What are more popular alternatives to those?; Correct. 

SMH has not come close to recapturing its July high despite the market attaining several new ATHs. It's failed to decisively break $260 resistance twice during that timespan, and now it's rolling over. Semis were in the red even during the post-election hype rally.; Depends on the semi exposure. The only line of business for the past year or so that has been good was the advanced compute/ai stuff. 

If you follow the market, auto and industrial names that are more of the dumb chips have not found a bottom and have been seeing sales slump for a while.; Shorting is the ultimate fomo game.

I have some cash sitting on the sidelines; This is Trump's economy now, so the only companies that will do good in the future have a direct hand in his corruption. That is why TSLA and PLTR are up, it's because they will directly benefit from this corruption.; I remember '99. I was there. I lost 30k in the Dot Com bubble bursting. 2000/2001 basically.

This is not the same as that. Because, for every AppLovin or Palantir that we have right now, we had 30 more in 1999. It's only a few stocks here and there that are going nuclear.

If things were really as amazing as people make it out to be, my portfolio would be sky high and it isn't.

Unfortunately, I don't have a Palantir or AppLovin in my lineup. My only stock that's pumped recently has been Palo Alto, but it's pump was incredibly mild compared to some of the highflyers. I have a bunch of stocks that have gone nowhere recently. Google, Broadcom and AMD are three great examples. All wallowing in the mud, for various reasons. Broadcom is up if you zoom out, but I only bought it earlier this year. I didn't get it in 2023, wish I did.

Basically, the point I'm trying to make is that in 1999, the equivalent of Google, AMD and Broadcom would all be going absolutely sky high. Everything was topping. It wasn't just the hardcore internet plays with high potential and zero real-world profits that were going absolutely nuclear..... even the regular stocks were going wild. We don't have that right now. Is Apple $245 right now? Is Microsoft $500 right now?; > Because we are in a market bubble only surpassed by 99 and 29. 

based on what?; I’m just saying the obvious mate and I’m not complaining about any stock stock falling specifically rn; Because it doesn't trade on fundamentals and has a cult following, It's not a bad company per se, I myself own some shares, but it's just trading on vibes with P/S of 28, higher than that of SpaceX; I will be messaging you in 2 months on [**2025-01-15 16:44:21 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2025-01-15%2016:44:21%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1grtfyq/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_nov/lxaelx7/?context=3)

|-|-|-|-|; Over what time span? Eventually yields will retreat in the short-term but I believe we're in a secular upwards trend.; you mean RKLB?
It's the best space stock IMO . Have revenue, revenue keep growing, the least volatile compare to gsat asts lunr.; I wanted to be greedy, but once it hit $171.50 I figured it was best to take the money and run. 

For someone who just started options trading, you hit the jackpot on this one. Don't feel any regrets about not trying to maximize down to the dollar.; We'll have to wait and see. Won't have the TFSA room for it until January anyways, but I'll keep an eye out.; didnt think about a pump & dump because of this. damn good looking out.; does he have experience in small scale nuclear or has he said something about it? i just know his background is, in part, in fossil fuels and possibly some self-delivering mechanisms whatever they are.; They’ve doomed us all; I’ve meant the P/E ratio being so low lmao. Just because it has went up doesn’t mean it’s not undervalued af; I am looking into LRCX and KLAC. Already have some AMAT and ASML , down some though. Once we commit to holding long term and factor in the demand for power/cost efficient chip and the associated complexity, it should work out great.; Yeah I’m excited to see what the earnings look like once the “dumb chips” inevitably rebounds.

If that rebounds and AI chip demand stays strong, earnings could be insane the next few years; That's bullish cuz it means economy isn't fooking exploding; No interest in CDNS and klac?; That one has been eclipsed by the EU one.; They can't control them, so all they can do is extort them. 

No difference than paying the mob ""protection"" money.; Something like 70% of Britain doesn't have AC and for some weird reason, global temps are higher....; Midstream should enjoy a nice decade ahead, so we're in a good spot to slowly add to our holdings.; There is another user here, i always forget their name, that had a post around equipment maker names. If follow the chip space, outside of advance computer, there has been a ton of weakness in auto and industrial markets. 

A lot of these names have come down in price and are looking like solid longs, but there is still going to be pain until those markets recover. 

With ONTO in particular, they did just report earnings on the 31st and I recently got into them after learning more about them. 

I know a lot of people are kind of hit or miss with youtube, but I would highly suggest watching the video from chip stock investor on ONTO. We can't post youtube links here, but they are hands down one of the best ways to learn about a lot of these companies. They are trying to sell you on their discord/news letter, but overall still gives you great content from the videos.; Not going to lie, I had only been eyeing AMAT, but I saw ONTO in this thread, looked at its stats, and like it at a glance. It seems like it’s on sale in today. I’m part of the Reddit repeat problem. Have no position, but it’s on my radar from this subreddit.; Thanks, Interesting to know.; Great to know, solid growth story.; no idea about ulta moat but they must have something  - look at those margins. Elf is is a marketing machine with high margin beauty product company attached. Not sure how old you are but it is hard, imo, for the over 50 crowd to understand ( and stomach) the way marketing to younger women has to be handled now. Its clear that both L'oreal and Estee Lauder have had a hard time responding the demands of a younger consumer when there was choice. The ""moat"" is its human capital imo. Once the street gets a better handle on elf's ability to grow at a lower growth rate the stock will probably regain its upward trend. It won't grow like in the past but likely has a ton of runway left over the medium and longer term. I have my fingers crossed for a long long long runway of high simgles to low teens growth internally financed but we'll see; [deleted]; I will tell you to all in . Because I hold a lot of MSTR. Finacial advice!; Market has been completely ignoring any geopolitical risk for semiconductors.; My guess for now is that it won't really start being priced in until we flip the calendar to 2025 and it's going to be a huge mess because semiconductors have gotten too far intertwined with the Nasdaq compared to even the recent past.

Gonna have to take down some of my exposure to Broadcom, pop some popcorn, and be ready to pounce when you see SMH lose most of its gains from late 2023.; Buy high sell low the redditor way; If the news is poor, the trading opportunities to the downside will be even greater.; Bro.. Thursday - options expiry is a more probable explanation than anything ; It's interesting how so many people miss that aspect of earnings. It's not uncommon for people to ask why around them and it's usually a few things that impact how people trade earnings, which is like how much the stock ran up, how was last quarters performance, what is the guidance, then any macro news like stock buybacks or leadership changes. 

Plus I want to say you can even look at options to see the implied move to the upside or downside.; >He said he would also remove AI barriers that Biden put in

Now we know who to blame the robot uprising on; >he would also remove AI barriers that Biden put in

How is this bad for the tech sector?; [deleted]; It's a stock with an incurable disease of insider selling. First bezos, now MacKenzie rumors say.; U think it’s going down even more next week? My plan is to DCA weekly to be safe and then eventually lump sum; Sigh.. yes thats the one. You're not gonna gloat about how its slid -50% in the last week are you???; Id add that u should buy the one with the lowest expense fee; I think he's a bot; I like the thesis but who are Onto's main clients? I want to know if theyre mainly selling to TSMC or companies like Intel.; You are correct. I also believe the OP holds $ON; Because companies’ trajectories can always change; Because MRNA is down almost 90% from its pandemic peak. 37 today - you think it will ever reach 450 again?; A lot of individual stocks either stay flat or go negative. Just check out the stocks in the SP500. You need to time it to do well. Look at $MSFT is it extremely flat this year, great company.; Sylvester Stallone trying his best for Dept of Education calling Trump the 2nd George Washington.; The fact is that the unemployment rate is low, consumer spending is still resilient, inflation is calming down, and growth is still good

Could be a lot worse: recession; Biden didn't add ""8 trillion to GDP"". The economy was coming out of COVID so naturally GDP would skyrocket back up. But Biden torched gross output in the process - that's far more important than GDP - which is why so many sectors are in malaise.; Yes its a lot easier to add GDP when trillions of money gets printed; Yeah I’m seeing a huge dip. I ate losses on EL earlier this month. I think I’m just going to ride these out for a while.; Probably not alone.


I'm going to credit CosmicSpiral here. There's clearly no interest in markets right now. 


I was right that the vol unwind was going to push markets higher, but there was no substance behind it outside the vol unwind.


EoY flows may help us hold on for dear life, but I think we may be screwed next year.; Oh no back to values last seen since... Monday! 

Did you just start investing last week or something?; yeah, but there a lot good turnaround stories for legacy industry stalwarts that lost their direction. 

look at GE, 3m.; [deleted]; Would you explain how you can read the steal make up of the stocker market? And how to read the money flows?; Karp is always like that. He’s a weird one lol; 09/25; people started using signal and telegram a lot more in my groups. messenger is literally dead in my group. few years ago, everyone was on messenger.; Assuming Reels is an entity that hasn’t split from FB\Insta, I’d say TikTok is far more popular with younger people. Meta platforms have a larger existing user base.

There are countless alternative for messaging apps.; Letter; Clown market valuations. Meme stocks going up on nothing. PLTR at a P/S ratio over 50. TSLA at a P/E of 88.

224,Naive question: Intel 18A--what could go wrong?,"\[Disclosure: not invested in Intel yet but thinking about doing so\]

Ok, we know Intel messed up and whatever but what I do not get (so please challenge my train of thoughts):

* Intel got newest machines from ASML last year
* They use them for 18A
* Like TSMC does for AMD, Apple, etc.
* Lunar Lake is a combo of Intel's design skills and TSMC's/ASML's fab skills
* But with low margins because of latter
* However, Lunar Lake turned out pretty good, so Intel's design skills are def there
* And with 18A, Intel will have everything in-house

So, what could go wrong? Maybe Intel need quite some time to catch up and have the same fab capacity based on ASML machines but we will get there at some point.

The competition? AMD will have (long-term!) lower margins b/c of TSMC (also slower time-to-market, lower quantities), Qualcomm has lower compat and needs still to resort issues with ARM, Nvidia while capable will need some time and will have a good offer but they won't have a fab either and will face compat issues like Qualcomm. Not saying that these are dealbreakers but yeah...

What does speak against Intel: org is too messed to get it ever restructured and/or reorg too expensive, running out of money (but gov money), time, building fabs needs years, zero EUV experience, low yields for years

Edit: Intel has a lower market cap than AMD despite AMD just having design in-house, they have more assets in the GPU department but it is insignificant compared to something like Nvidia and if we talk about IGPUs Intel seem to be on par

Edit2: Would at least a new CEO just give us a bump, so we could leave again with some short-term gains?

Edit3: typos

So, is buying Intel really a risk with its dirt-cheap pricing right now? Is it really ""dirt-cheap""?",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1grrx4w/naive_question_intel_18awhat_could_go_wrong/,10,2024-11-15 09:32:29,"I worked in semiconductor industry, the biggest issue is always whether one company able to ramp their yields to mature yield with reasonable cost. Intel has proven time and time again that they are not able to ramp “relatively easier” products. I find it laughable they are able to do ramp the harder products knowing their track records.; Easy. For me, Intel always overpromises and under delivers, at least since the 2000s. I want them to just deliver as promised. Many companies under promise and over deliver. I just want intel to deliver as they say without any excuses (water issues for fabbing, management issues, CEO issues, EUV issues, anything... including the ""unexpected"").; WCGW with 18A?

It could be another repeat of their 10nm/7/4/3/20A, late and under performing against TSMC. With the cancellation of 20A and future of 14A in doubt...

>They use them for 18A

No, they use them for 14A

>org is too messed to get it ever restructured and/or reorg too expensive

Arent they doing reorgs every x months?

>zero euv experience

Seems like a bullshit; Boils down to management & corporate governance. While your argument points may be valid, the company has yet to show that they have had a proven track record to turn company around. 

Intel stocks is long term play, don't expect a quick turnaround. Park money there and check back in 4 years (under Trump WH policies).; I just bought INTC (because of the low P/S) while already holding positions in TSMC and Qualcomm. I'm drunk, though.; Modern logic chips can contain thousands of steps inside a fab, each one needs to be optimized to achieve a very high yield so that products can be profitable. It's a huge labor and capital intensive, systematic work. 

I think you underestimate the complexity. EUV is just some steps involved, and by simply having EUV does not guarantee success. From design to fab, all have to work like stars aligned to make Intel come back strong.

Not saying intel is going belly up, because Uncle Sam won't let that happen (like, Boeing). But if failed, profitability will take a great hit, and may never recover.; I'll save you some money. Go on Intel's website, download their annual report and read the whole thing. 

In one section there is an exhaustive list of the things that could cause them to lose money. Things you may not have thought about.; Something something, buy when others are fearful. Sandy Bridge 2.0 right around the corner. Buy now or fomo in later.; In Taiwan, the medium salary is 16,000$ US a year.

So people busted their ass to get into semiconductor industry.  And they work like a slave after they get in there because ""they have no other choice"".

There is no way US worker are willing to do that.; No chance.  They can't even get the 7nm or 5nm right, how to jump to something like 2nm? 

Samsung foundry has proven their processes to be better than Intel.  And look how far behind they are TSMC still; Yeah that is a valid point, they proved that they can't which might hint a totally broken org (and/or wrong tech). However, they didn't do EUV in the past, do you think that this might change something this time?; Would you be able to provide more colour on why Samsung and Intel are unable to increase yield at TSM levels despite having the “same” equipment from ASML? Is it solely due to the difference in quality of labour?

Also would like to hear your thoughts on whether skipping generation is a feasible/only way in semis? I notice Samsung and intel have the tendency to do so. Yet as you rightly mentioned how would they be able to compete in a harder tech when they can’t even get the basic right. I guess what I am asking is we all know about the difficult of skipping generation, but why are intel and Samsung still trying to do so? Is there not enough demand to be the 2nd/3rd best player?; they didn't with Lunar Lake, so design-wise they are on the edge; 10 & 7 nm run fine, but have bad margins due to no EUV. Not great, but fine.
3 / 4 nm run ok now, but are not competitive enough to win external customers. Basically just too late, otherwise was fine.


20A was a one-product premature version of 18A, it's a very bad look they canceled this. If we can believe their take that this was due to refocus on 18A because that is going so well, then maybe it turns out fine. If they simply couldn't make it work well, then not so much.


14A is not in doubt, where did you read that?


I think Intel's real problem is the design and integration. Their first real chiplet advanced packaged chips in Lunar Lake are horribly unoptimized for the consumer space. They need learning cycles to refine, but they might not have enough for 18A to be wildly successful.

The other challenge is getting customers to fill the fab space. Who will pay big bucks for Intel if TSMC is available.; \> No, they use them for 14A

source that they do not use ASML for 18A?

edit, you significantly edited your post beyond typos AFTER I've replied

edit2:

\> Seems like a bullshit

what big EUV exp does intel have?; Bullish; Pat Gelsinger performing an exorcism live at the next earnings call is suspiciously not listed there.; even with more expensive US workers, Intel's margins will be higher than with outsourcing to TSMC; Sure they are.  Just pay them like Google and Meta pay their engineers.  Pay enough relative to the median wage of other US jobs, and top engineers will be busting their ass to get in.  What's total compensation for a senior engineer at Intel versus one at Meta?

If you can't afford to do that, it's cool, but don't anyone pretend it's a mystery why Taiwanese companies are getting better semiconductor results.  They're paying for best of the best relative to the other opportunities in their country.; \>  how to jump to something like 2nm?

using EUV/ASML; I think you are underestimating how difficult it is to ramp new tools like EUV (or even high NA EUV). If Intel is able to ramp their EUV, their 7nm products will be already successful and we will not even talk about this story at the first place. 

Samsung also does EUV for their logic products, but their yield is so horrible that QCOM ran away from them to TSMC.

It’s like this, EUV allows you noobs to climb Everest, but it still requires capable bodies and massive efforts to reach the peak.; It's not about the equipment but about the process. Every step needs to be extremely well controlled and understood. Each step has many variables that can be tuned, thousands of parameters to be set in the equipment and it all needs to be controlled with feedback loops to find and keep the sweet spot.


TSMC has very advanced and successful analysis systems that have helped them really understanding how each critial step is doing and whether/ what they need to slightly tweak to adjust for fluctuations upstream.


Samsung has had issues with not being able to find where the real issues are in the process, struggling to find a good sweet spot to begin with.


Intel has had process issues, but also design issues where they went for an architecture that relied on some process steps to be really good...and they weren't and could not be fixed without open heart surgery.
But still much more controlled and promising than Samsung, just not at the efficency and margins of TSMC.



They can skip a generation because the learnings build upon each other, so you can just keep going beyond the point where you could've put a stick in the sand and say ""this process flow I will freeze and make a technology line"". Just keep going with development, and you'll end up at another of those opportunities, and you'd call that a next generation. There are some real revolutions in design, those a more binary jumps, like bspdn and gaa.

The Downside is that you don't monetize, and don't learn any new insights from indistrializing the process. But if you can eat the cost then it can pay off.; 18A is not the first EUV/ASML node. Intel 4 and 3 already use EUV and no DUV, it was only Intel 7 that was on DUV. 

[https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/resources/high-volume-euv-intel-4-europe.html#gs.i7bfqm](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/resources/high-volume-euv-intel-4-europe.html#gs.i7bfqm)

High NA EUV, the new machines will only be used on 18A for risk analysis and not for production. The new tools will only be used in 14A production. [https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-foundry-opens-new-frontier-chipmaking.html#gs.i78dib](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-foundry-opens-new-frontier-chipmaking.html#gs.i78dib)

Additionally, just buying the tool means nothing because latest data from IBM/IMEC shows the new tools will also need Metal organic resists and there are no reports from Intel on how they are progressing with those.; Thought u were talking about high-na euv; 14A will be the first process where they won't be at least partly dependent on TSMC.; That's not how it goes. TSMC has PhD's working 70 hours without overtime for a low salary because they have such a monopoly position in the msrket locally. So it would be like working in the US for Tesla but getting paid 75K and not having better companies around to jump to.


They basically get >30% more PhD level labor than is possible in US, because here workers have flexibility and demand good pay. They run into this in Arizona already, turns out its not that Intel is so inefficient, but that the US labor laws and culture are different.; lold; If tuning a process was simply buying machinery, then anyone could do it. 

Why is TSMC the only choice now then?; I agree and wrote myself ""zero EUV exp"". But again, right now Intel has the same design skills as AMD but still have half of latter's market cap (plus some old fabs plus some new ASML machinery without proper fabs yet); I would like to add for Samsung. Korean company with chaebol base like Samsung is very famous for their poor cultural issues. Like Korean drama, constant blame game and shifting responsibility instead of all hands of deck and resolving the issues. Thus, resulting in particularly slow and steady bleeding. While they have smart people, they may not able to utilise in effective and efficient manners.

And to answer people that insist EUV is able to save the company, Samsung is one company that is very aggressive on implementing EUV in 1Z DRAM, where hynix only start putting in on 1alpha, and Micron only start putting in on 1gamma. And yet, samsung is the one behind in DRAM now.

EUV is not the saviour, its a tool. It depends on who wields it. Either is a genius, or fool, only time will tell.; Also would like to know if anybody successful jump generation before? My understanding was Samsung failed multiple times in both DDR5 and logic using GAA; Thank you the for the explanation. Are there any books/channel that you could recommend for a non tech/engineering guy to read up and get up to speed with the term (sufficient to understand whats a FinFET and GAA).; the whole debate is not about which exact ASML model they use BUT more that 18A is the first EUV/ASML node (using latest machines) and that that might change their trajectory; IDK, I have just read that still some quantities or part of Panther Lake should be done by TSMC; First, TSMC CEO did not get paid excessively like most CEO in America. Second, the bonus is based on stock performance. Every engineer gets about 30 months salary bonus in the end of year. This happened every year in the past five years.; \> If tuning a process was simply buying machinery, then anyone could do it.

good point and imagine, a new player had to start a fab, from scratch. they would have to build of everything. intel in contrast has everything, except the fabs, and building those is hard enough but at least they are doing it now, you could now say what's with samsung, tbh idk why their fabs are so behind

\> Why is TSMC the only choice now then?

idk, maybe bc a fab is so complex and running these ASML machines are hard to operate, a bit like McDonalds soft serve machines; probably because TSMC doubled-down on ASML very early and ordered max amount of EUV machines; May, but doesnt have to

It is not like they didnt have time to get small scale experience with this technology in prev. years; So? Those things are besides the point; Intel *has* the fabs. The process of demoing obsolete machinery and installing cutting edge tools, then tuning, qualling, and ramping takes years.

Reddit thinks a 5 year timeline takes 6 months and it is consistently hilarious.; >intel in contrast has everything, except the fabs, 

????

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_manufacturing_sites; So you want to compare Intel with Rapidus?  There's no one after Rapidus. 

Its simply TSMC, which has over 95 percent market share in 5nm and below process nodes, Samsung with 5,  Intel with 0, and Rapidus with 0. 

And if you agree that running a fab is complex, why on earth would you believe Intel can run a fab focused on advanced nodes?; \> May, but doesnt have to

I wrote ""might change""; TSMC has the system to motivate engineers work harder and in the end company benefits from the achievement.; No, TSMC can afford to overwork and underpay entry and medior level PhD's to a degree that doesn't work in Europe or USA.


You can simply compare the cost and productivity per engineer for the same seniority level, and you see that labor is much cheaper in Taiwan than in the US, Europe is in between.
And that difference is not because Taiwan has smarter workers or that they get more done in the same hours, it's mostly that they work crazy hours because if they don't there will be consequences."

227,Supermicro - hold or sell - my strategy,"Disclosure of related position: I bought Supermicro for my growth and momentum trading strategy back in January 2022 for $43.20 (split aligned $4.32) and then doubled down the 6th of September 2022 for $64.22 (split aligned $6.422). Then I partially sold 15th May 2023 at 137.19 (split aligned 13.719), 10th of January 2024 at  $355 (split aligned $35.5) and 12th of September 2024 at $442.13 (split aligned $44.231).

I took out already much more than I did put in, but still own a large position of SMCI. Now I'm in the process of changing the rule for a complete selling in my strategy. As you can see in my disclosure I left a lot of money on the table which already made me change the way I take partial gains.

But let's speak about Supermicro here. What happened:

Hindenburg took a short position and published a report about bookkeeping fraud at Supermicro. Then the auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned. The company is now behind on the mandatory reports to the SEC two quarters. This weekend is the deadline for a de-listing on the NASDAQ. The stock tanked 82% from the high. According to the actual published numbers (which may be corrected) the stock is now almost as cheap as when I bought it first, even if the value more than quadrupled still after the loss of 82%.

Now, Hindenburg at first only cited ex employees as source. But the resignation of Ernst & Young as auditor was probably an ace in Hindenburgs sleeve. I personally know Ernst & Young, they are not exactly my favorites. Since they published the report there was a mass of bad news published, the exact same analysts that hived Supermicro to the SP500 more or less exactly at the high say now it is junk after that loss.

I was thinking about Apple. In the time it would have been most profitable to buy everybody shouted sell. The stock lost more than once 80% of its market value.

Supermicro owns a lot of very unique patents. Their liquid cooled systems take less time to build and are more modular than any of the other competitors systems, Dell being its main competitor. Even if they reported some orders too early as sale they sell a lot lot more than a few years ago thanks to AI. And they will probably sell a lot more.

I think it is very possible that we cannot trade Supermicro on the Nasdaq next week. An that means it will fall out of the SP500 and the NASDAQ 100, putting a lot of sell pressure on the ETF that mirror those indices. Or, Supermicro presents a new auditor and a plan to deliver the reports to the SEC by this weekend.

It is probably a binary bet that will be resolved soon. In my opinion the upside (probability to win multiplied with amount to win) is much higher than the downside (probability to lose multiplied with amount to lose). And even if it is delisted, it is far away from being worthless. Probably it will be a target for Dell.

Here a [chart of Apple](https://www.tradingview.com/x/SDXjHW8c/) when it made most sense to hold them and when they lost a lot.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gqa9ht/supermicro_hold_or_sell_my_strategy/,41,2024-11-13 11:53:33,"IMO, the way things have gone in the last 4-5ish years there's been enough mediocre companies or companies with problems that managed to turn into memes or rebound via other ways that were previously unheard of/unusual/uncommon. I think that's resulted in everything like the SMCI situation being viewed as an opportunity. 

Again, I have no idea what happens to SMCI but the last few years imo have made people a little too complacent about these sorts of situations. SMCI's auditor left (not a minor issue) and instantly that day tons of ""it must be a buying opportunity, right?"" posts.

IMO, we're eventually going to go back to bad is bad and not sure if it's this, but IMO eventually something genuinely bad is going to be looked at by enough people as a compelling gamble and it'll open up as a penny stock one morning.

___________________

Also ... I think people are forgetting that SMCI was actually delisted in 2018 for failing to file reports. https://ir.supermicro.com/news/news-details/2018/Supermicro-Announces-Suspension-of-Trading-of-Common-Stock-on-Nasdaq-and-its-Intention-to-Appeal/default.aspx

And that the CFO and company were charged by the SEC in 2020 with ""widespread accounting violations."" (https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020-190); I sold, better companies out there that actually go up; I don't own any stock in supermicro, but the company has been around since 1993 and it has manufactured computer parts for alot of other vendors. Working in the I.T field, their parts are seen in alot of appliances and servers over the years. I think they need to get some better management, and this company can do really good. I'm actually surprised what is going on.; I bought simply because reddit says it's done for. Worth the gamble.; equating apple with smci is simply fascinating. 

  
why not equate them with enro? or does that dispute your narrative that somehow delaying important filings and having no auditors is somehow fine?

  
without integrity, there's nothing; They filed another time extension, Q1 2025 10Q unable to proceed due to Q1 2024 10k not being filed... this looks doomed.; here is my scoop on SMCI:  

Current Situation is that SMCI’s down about 82% due to bookkeeping fraud claims, SEC report delays, and a possible NASDAQ delisting. Still, they hold patents and a solid spot in AI servers though so no need to panic just yet

Why Hold?? If SMCI sorts out SEC issues, the upside could be huuuge. Plus, you've already profited from past sales, so it’s less risky overall.

Why Sell?? Delisting and SEC issues are a lot of risk, and sentiment’s pretty negative rn.

Maybe sell part to lower risk but keep some in case it rebounds in the future

These days you can even get some decent stock analysis that also can digest news and official reports for you from AI tools. I like using Castello AI for financial stuff—they have a pretty cool subreddit too. I'd put a link, but I don’t wanna promote; they’re just a solid resource imo.; SMCI has a very healthy business. They will not sell themselves. They do have bad management and sales teams are disorganized. But again they have a very healthy business no matter what...; I’m in the same boat. Holding 10,000 shares with a big loss. I’m down about 65% on that investment. At this point, I’m betting it will not go down much further.. I’ll hold it for a few years and join the class action suits to recover some damages.; Damn this thing went up 40% after hours; I work as a buyer in electrical component distribution. I buy super micro products daily. Motherboards mostly for data center / AI servers. As well full barebones systems and chassis. Their products are in shortage and are in constant demand. I bought at $32 and I’m confident it will go back up.; Meta, Elon, Amazon/Anthropic, openAI, and on and on, all have announced multi-billion dollar data centers to be build starting in 2025.  There was never a problem with their products or work.  They build Elon's Memphis Monstrosity in record time.  

SM has the ""greenest"" liquid cooling tech currently available, making their tech an obvious choice when the government eventually cracks down on the amount of natural resources these data centers just piss away. 

That said, huge accounting firms like EY generally don't just walk away without some hard proof of some sketchy shit that they want no part of.  They had to have some reason to just walk away from aa valuable client, and had to be some reason most of the top executives bailed or were canned. 

 THAT said, is possible the shortsellers that started this mess got to EY, either through the press, or some smokey backroom deal.  It would be far from the first time a short seller had a ""business lunch"", then ganged up on a company.  

I bought tons of it when it dipped below 20.  Cashed it out - probably not gonna get back in at 40, but if it dips 25-30, I'm back in baby.  Elon just said today he's going to grow his Memphis Monstrosity to over a million GPU's.  One tweet that he's tapping SMCI to do it, which he will, he loves fellow possibly criminals who work FAST, and it'll shoot to 70 in a few hours.  Set a bot to buy it up if it hits 25. 

The valuations are out of control. How the hell is Plantir worth it's current valuation?  It's absurd.  A huge correction is coming.  Have cash on hand for discount purchases.; Hindenburg is right 81% of the time btw. EY resigned, Deloitte left or was fired and BFA also organised a class action law suit. All of these organisations are wrong and SMCI is just misunderstood. You do you.; Fold; Supermicro could be the new Peleton. I’m not going to say it will happen, but right now it’s a giant risk, however the reward can also be big as the revenue stream still seems to be very high, and Nvidia can’t really use Lenovo, Dell and HP to launch their products at the same speed SM does.; They literally said a couple hours ago they cannot provide a new auditor or report by this weekend. Knowing this, whats stopping delisting?; What's baffling is that even last week after all the news the stock was flat on the 1 yr chart. And is only down 20% now.; Why did SMCI go up 30x above their previous highest price ever ($4 in 2015) between early 2022 and early 2024?  Is it just from building servers around Nvidia cards?  They're a good integrator but how much of a moat can they really have?; How much of an advantage is ""their liquid cooled systems take less time to build and are more modular than any of the other competitors systems"" when it comes to revenue and marketshare compared to say, Dell? Also, for Blackwell superpods liquid cooling is a requirement, not a differentiator between server/rack solutions, so I'm just not sure how much of a leg up SMCI has.

Per NVIDIA's [Press Release](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-blackwell-platform-arrives-to-power-a-new-era-of-computing):  
**""Cisco, Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo and Supermicro are expected to deliver a wide range of servers based on Blackwell products, as are Aivres, ASRock Rack, ASUS, Eviden, Foxconn, GIGABYTE, Inventec, Pegatron, QCT, Wistron, Wiwynn and ZT Systems.""**

That's A LOT of competitors offering similiar products. What makes SMCI so very special?  As a LT investor, I have missed a lot of gains on staying out of the hype train including SMCI, but also a lot of downsides as well. This feels very similar to when I asked ""What makes fastly so special?"" Turns out, nothing.

There are so many other names that have good momentum that fits the second half of the phrase: ""“in the short run, the market is a popularity contest but in the long run, it is a weighing contest.” In the long run, I don't think SMCI can grow that much--just like FSLY, AAOI, and so many others.

With that said, the market has done crazy things, so we all have to make our own decisions.; Hey bro, I want to start by saying its going to be alright either way. I'd advise against buying more SMCI but I'm no financial adviser. This post looks like what the reddit community calls ""Copium"". SMCI is likely never going to be a $1,000 ($100 post split) stock again. 

I've been a part of a lot of start-ups that benefited from being in lucrative industries early. Almost across the board, those companies are now a shell of what they once were. What happens is ego and human greed at the top level. That's very likely what happened here, considering the Founder is the CEO still. 

The guy probably let his head get massive and overspent / way over bonused himself and the company is loosing money / revenue is declining. Chasing after keeping the image of Growth, he probably instructed EY / his Finance team to lie in some Quarterly Reports. And now the chickens came home to roost.

E and Y is a big 4 accounting firm. Literally the best of the best in the whole world. Regardless of how you feel about them, they're good. At the same time, they're an accounting firm. Literally any company can have them do their books, and they'll do them, as long as you pay. There'd be no reason for them to cut that relationship unless something shady was happening. So something shady is probably happening. The reason they left is if EY started associating themselves with cooked books, it would destroy their brand once it became public knowledge. Its not a good thing if they have left. 

I'd imagine most of their recent Quarterly Reports were fraudulent. It's probably a lot worse of a company then all of us were led to believe. Its probably loosing clients very fast. The space is becoming very crowded and legacy IT giants are likely starting to do better than 1st to market companies like SMCI.

You can hold if you want,I understand that. Its a gamble, but its also reasonable. But do not buy more until you have a reason to believe this company's financials are actually legit.; Kind of absurd ur comparing SMCI to AAPL. just saying; Woup woup; Let it die dude, this stock is going to 0 just like spirit airlines.; They are likely going to be bought out by Intel. My guess is that someone will look at everything and buy this company on the cheap. The management is the problem. They have no guardrails in place to prevent fraud and need to be cleaned up. Bad luck happened when I bought it and to me that was the sign not to own.; >And they will probably sell a lot more.

Appreciate the analysis, but curious why you believe customers will still buy products from SuperMicro if they are delisted. Why would they take the risk of buying from a company that is untrustworthy? Is their product really head and shoulders above Dell? I know as an IT manager I'd have a hard time convincing my company to purchase SuperMicro products.

You make a good point about an acquisition. If they really do have valuable patents and technological superiority, and the stock is really as cheap as people suggest, a company like Dell might be interested. But then that would require a much more detailed audit that could reveal even more questions.

I'm an interested bystander, ready to pounce if this company does find a way out of this mess. But I wouldn't risk any amount of money on SMCI shares today, not while the market is offering up hundreds of other opportunities.; The problem now is not just that SMCI is probably fudging the numbers, it's also that NVDA has been diverting their deliveries to go to other companies. If SMCI isn't getting the chips, then there's no point investing in them.; IMO Maybe overusing IMO’s...; Yes, that is the nature of private investors holding stocks. But I do not think Supermicro is just a MEME stock. And I don't think a de-listing would be the end of the company, just look what happened after the last time.

Thank you for your post. It is very difficult to keep a neutral view when you are invested and already made that much money with it. So I welcome any different view.

I think the hardest part this time will be the exclusion from the SP500 and NASDAQ100. If that happens probably Hindenburg will cover from the many ETF that have to sell. If not there could be a squeeze. We will see...; 99% success rate strategy. i reckon you gain 300% in a couple years. HOLD; Actually I compared the situation with Apple for one only reason: **the best time to buy apple would have been when it lost 50-85% of its value**... more than once. Even if you bought before the decline you'd made tons of cash.

I never owned apple stock, but I did own Priceline that later acquired booking.com. I think my original entry price in the 90s was a few dollars ($2 maybe) and it's worth today like $5'000. So whatever more errors I did in my 44 years in the stock market, selling Priceline for a few 100% gain was probably the worst.

I want my strategy to avoid that. One can only lose 100% but gain thousands. But then thinking that I was up 2'000% in Supermicro at one point makes me a little angry. Lucky I sold already for more than my entry was, but all that money left on the table makes me think...; Wonder if the announcement is enough to not being de-listed...probably not.; Thanks, will check it out. Do they use Supermicro hardware? :); Very sorry to hear that. I had a good entry price and took out a nice sum so I cannot lose any real money on that trade. But all the nice booked gains are disappearing and that hurts too.

But remember: the morning is close when the night is darkest.

The hardware is found in many systems. But the owner did trust the wrong people, sales people try to sell at all costs and should therefor not be present in management.; Yes. Always bet against reddit 'experts' lol. They are wrong about pretty much everything; Super shallow misguided short analysis like this contributed to our profits/ thanks!; Why would the SEC delist them when they've granted them 1+ year's of extension in the past? Even when the company restated their financials, the changes weren't substantial, thus the paltry fines.; Why would the SEC delist them when they've granted them 1+ year's of extension in the past? Even when the company restated their financials, the changes weren't substantial, thus the paltry fines.; Yep. Ball is now at the SEC. I don't think they will de-list Supermicro because at least they came up with a communication in time. But you never know, Hindenburgs arms are long...; They had first mover advantage for liquid cooled Ai services.  They landed HUGE ($1B+) infrastructure build out deals with companies like Xai and Coreweave.  These deals were much bigger than anything they've had in the past.  Thus, the large run up in revenue.   Problem is that they don't have any real long-term advantages technologically.  Liquid cooling has been around a long time, and other companies will figure it out.   So ask yourself... will they continue to land the whales?; I must rely on other people here. But what I hear is they have a real advantage on liquid cooled systems and hold many patents in many different areas. The owner and CEO is an engineer but probably not the best manager. The transition from a family company to a Fortune 500 company is hard.

The company entered the SP500 more or less at it's all-time high and all the analysts were clapping their hands. Now they shout ""sell"" like always, after the fact. I just ignore that.; Why do you think E&Y is the best of the best? I had them as auditors for my own company and they would let me down for no reason. OK, my luck, I didn't pay their last excessive invoice after they let me down. And I am completely and absolutely sure that I did no wrongdoing in our bookkeeping. Hired a better and cheaper local auditor and never looked back.

In my opinion somewhere way up at E&Y and at Hindenburg there was a very quiet and very illegal deal. As in the last chapter of ""industry"": **cheat the cheater**.

After Market plus 17%, they will officially present their filings on Monday.; Probably in hindsight, yes. But then? 

There is an important difference: Supermicro declined in a bull market.

Rose 17% in after market, they will present their filings to the SEC on Monday.; How can a company with a massive amount of business go to zero?; Buyers do not care if company is on stock exchange. Most even don't know it. IT for a long time prefers supermicro hardware because it is the best quality/price performance there is in the market; That is actually not true; > But I do not think Supermicro is just a MEME stock.

I don't think it's a meme either but I think enough things have meme'd or otherwise rebounded unusually out of problems in recent years (large trucking company Yellow declared bankruptcy in 2023, then the stock went up 600% before losing all of that and then some) that people's instant reaction to something like an auditor leaving and not wanting to be associated with the company's financials now seems like it results in instant ""buying opportunity?"" posts.

IMO, too many people think after the last 4-5 years that every single negative announcement is a buying opportunity and in a lot of occasions they've been proven right. But when looking on a much longer time frame, I think the last 4-5 years have been unusual and there's a good chance we go back to more ""bad is bad."" That's all.

""And I don't think a de-listing would be the end of the company, just look what happened after the last time.""

No, but if it's delisted again for the same reasons at some point credibility in terms of the company's financial stewardship is going to be heavily/entirely eroded. They may have a great product, but if they get delisted a second time and return from that again, there's a decent chance there's going to be more hesitation then when the first time it happened.

""If that happens probably Hindenburg will cover from the many ETF that have to sell.""

I don't know that they're not already gone. I have a lot of respect for what they do, but imo it often feels like short sellers of that nature don't stick around in the manner that they used to as much and for good reason - it's been a much more difficult practice in recent years and too many people overstay there welcome and wind up facing a CVNA or to a lesser degree, something like CAVA.

You mention in the original post: ""As you can see in my disclosure I left a lot of money on the table which already made me change the way I take partial gains.""

I've always been someone who looks for longer-term holdings but it feels increasingly as if anything exciting that's working becomes a pile on much quicker, eventually becomes over-extended and then the escalator up often eventually turns into an elevator down. I've had a very good few years but the one common error that I've had on a few notable occasions was not taking profits on moves that turned out to be unsustainable and in those occasions, every time it's that escalator up over many months only to have that elevator down in a much shorter period.

""Thank you for your post. It is very difficult to keep a neutral view when you are invested and already made that much money with it. So I welcome any different view.""

Thanks! And again, nothing against what you're doing just some concerns more broadly about these sorts of situations. Hope it works out well for you.; You are focused on the wrong things. You need to ask ""Why"" did Apple lose 80% of its value. Hint: it wasn't because of potential fraud or cooking the books like with SMCI. Buying s stock just because the company is tanking is a good way to lose money.; honestly no idea, u gonna have to ask them directly .. they are pretty responsive on their subreddit; Every time I listen to their calls I think “why do they let this ceo talk” he needs to resign himself to chairman of the board and hire a top notch ceo. I will not sell now as I believe the company will survive this, but I do not expect to be green for years.; I did have some SMCI after EY quit as their auditor. But after they kept on dropping and I found out the CEO’s wife sits on the board and 2 companies that they do heavy biz with was the CEO’s bros or bro-in-laws, I sold it. That’s prob how they could manipulate their financial statements on the purchase n sales to those 2 companies. Too much family involvement. And wut they’re presenting to SEC on Mon is just a plan, not like it’s a 10Q or 10k and u don’t kno if they even found a major auditor who can check the books of a company their size. just saying..; No one is interested in buying stock in a fraudulent company. The business may continue but the stock will continue to drop and be removed from sp500 soon enough.; https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-nasdaq-nvda-moving-orders-away-super-micro-computer; People are just gambling hoping things will reverse.

Like the people who were investing in spirit.  They knew bankruptcy was likely. Then today they got fucked because they announced it.; And in this case it was very obvious Reddit and online investors overreacted and didn’t actually know what was going on based on discussion I saw- easy 100% profit in less than a month; >Does castello run un Supermicro hardware?

OOB experience could be better, but the releases are getting better hand-over-fist. Paid support if you want it; hardware if you want it. Voice stuff is almost there. #1 GitHub project by commits (IIRC) for 2024; velocity is high.

229,My views on why NVDA beats earnings and flies to higher supports. Likley past 200. ,"For the PE bitchers and moaners, I leave you this:

AMD Trailing Twelve Month ACTUAL PE is: 126  

NVDA Trailing Twelve Month ACTUAL PE is: 69 


Chanos bitched and moaned all the way to the broke house where he had to close shop. Tesla preaching and evangelizing the PE did him an apostate. He's done. TESLA CRUSHED HIM. Tesla easily slid into it's PE and Chanos is no more. Same thing happened with the bitchers and moaners with Amazon, Google, etc. When a company is a quality company and especially part of the SP500, where every iteration of that index HAS TO PURCHASE this stock, you ride well, and the company easily slides well into it's PE very well and snuggly like. 

Just like Zuckerberg sucker punched Open AI LLM's by making it's LLM open source and scorching the Earth, So goes NVDA: Open sourcing their DATA CENTER TECH, ( a little secret, its not just about the GPU, it's the entire package, it's not just about BLACKWELL GPU. But Rack/ Data Center Tech Design and Architecture, there will BE ZERO INCENTIVE FOR CUSTOMERS TO GO TO COMPETITORS WHEN RACK ARCHITECTURE THAT FITS BLACKWELL GPU's with ZERO ISSUE, IS COMPLETELY OUT IN THE OPEN: READ SUMMARY( this is why AMD and INTEL are having such a hard time competing and frankly anybody else, unless you're DELL and WORKING with Jensen... But Dell doesn't make chips, so their good bros and compliment each other very well in many ways, STILL NVDA HAS IT'S OWN DATA CENTER RACK TECHNOLOGY THAT IS NOT DELL'S AND IT IS NOW OPEN SOURCE- FROM COOLING TO ETHERNET AND SCALING DATA TECHNOLOGY... GIVING THEM A MASSIVE ADVANTAGE.. vs those that want to take away their Data Center Service / Business :

This OCP summit with this open sourcing debut specifically for Blackwell tech was as of last month, Oct 17th.

( Jensen is busy busy busy )  
""At this year’s OCP Global Summit, NVIDIA will be sharing key portions of the NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 system’s electro-mechanical design with the OCP community — including the rack architecture, compute and switch tray mechanicals, liquid-cooling and thermal environment specifications, and NVIDIA NVLink™ cable cartridge volumetrics—to support higher compute density and networking bandwidth.""  
..""said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “By advancing open standards, we’re helping organizations worldwide take advantage of the full potential of accelerated computing and create the AI factories of the future.”

Everybody KNOWS there is a plateau. A plateau and lower business revenues based on estimates that TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT INFERENCE IS LESS DEMANDING THAN TRAINING. THAT BEING SAID, MARKET IS NO LONGER LOOKING FOR INSANE NUCLEAR GROWTH. BUT STEADY HEALTHY GROWTH. THAT\*\* WILL PROPEL THIS STOCK HIGHER.

Crazy AI nuclear growth, is not what the market is expecting. Market is expecting a healthy stable growth, now that we are near equilibrium with AI and chips, ( this is obviously not true, but it's the arguments bears try to hang on. They think Amazon will overtake a 30 year CUDA industry software environment the entire world/industry has created THEIR ENTIRE INFRASTRUCTURE, BOTH SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE AROUND). Go look up CUDA. It's older than many traders here. There is no world, or dimension, in the slightest, where a newcomer, or an online retailer, will wrap up 30yrs in a qtr or two. Or three, or four... NVDA continues to climb on growth, steady healthy growth, not insane nuclear growth. THAT WILL PROPEL THIS STOCK HIGHER. It has no where else to go. Ive's and Wedbush, are ENTIRELY correct.

Lastly NVDA will own the entire vertical from Hyperscaler to Retail Individual end user level, why? NVDA has proven that compute, it was never just a smaller and faster cpu, it was all about ACCELERATED compute with gpu architecture to get computation to the next level- why the AI revolution is here. IE Enter NVDA Retail PC / Lap Top Chips coming Latest Sept 2025, with my guess, Jensen starts marketing from first half of 2025, and wider release commercially of NVDA CPU for 1st qtr of 2026, March, me thinks Jensen starts getting market ready all of 2025 for release in the wild September 2025 for retail user and full wider release by March 2026 / end of February 2026. Recap: for regular retail, end user like you and me: the latest we'll have to wait to get our hands on NVDIA designed CPU's for our end user RETAIL level laptops and pc's is Sept 2025. With ALL of 2025 being an advertisement year before the debut. Will we have actual testers with heavy hitter results as soon as first qtr of 2025? Will Jensen decide to release BEFORE Sept 2025?..

 I think all of 2025 NVDA CPU will be marketed to Kingdom come and anticipation brought to the brim, and that will be felt emotionally and in the actual stock price for this freak of nature NVDA CPU chip. Another knock out sucker punch to AMD and INTC QCOM and others. Moving into their end user market as well now. ; ) Recap: For regular end user like you and me CPU: Latest we'll have it physically in our laps in a laptop or on our desktop Sept of 2025. Meaning all of 2025 will be marketed to kingdom come before it's release in Sept 2025. And the full level CPU release by March 2026. So... yeah... AMD and INTEL have a lot to worry about. And as far as I know, Biden or Trump won't block sales of regular computer pc windows chips to China or anywhere else for that matter. :)

Imagine being the king of accelerated compute and now you have a cpu + gpu combo ARM chip that runs silent like Apple M chips and sips low power like such, but games and does AI and any heavy compute intense task very wicked like, very retail level computer chip level like that is specifically from the box ready to work with cuda and marry with existing nvidia gpu's at the hyperscaler level to even more efficiently run AI intense software and on prem (on the laptop or pc itself without cloud compute help, like QCOM snapdragon Elite PC boasts it can do(but sucks, incompatible with lots of software and games, not so with nvda). People will hunt down a windows PC that has both* NVDA* gpu AND CPU* chips. Here is the link for more info=

""Not just that, but NVIDIA is also cooking up its new GeForce RTX 50 series ""Blackwell"" desktop graphics cards, and its new GeForce RTX 50 Laptop series ""Blackwell"" mobile GPUs, which will end up being featured inside of these new AI PCs with an NVIDIA + MediaTek CPU based on the Arm architecture.""

""NVIDIA has also previously said that RTX is the ""Premium"" AI PC platform, and that CPUs and SoCs launching with new NPUs (Neural Processing Units for AI workloads) are for ""Basic"" AI PCs. The company is right, as a decent discrete GeForce RTX GPU can blow away any NPU inside of any CPU now, and for years to come.""

""The new silicon will support advanced technologies, and will be mass-produced on TSMC's new 3nm process node, and will compete against Apple's new M4 chip, and Qualcomm's Snapdragon X processors.""

""NVIDIA is aiming for high-end segment with its first consumer CPU, expected in 2025
NVIDIA and MediaTek's upcoming AI PC processor is expected to enter the high-end market in September 2025, with a wider release 'expected in March 2026'.""

""However, you'd think it would lean heavily on Nvidia's graphics technology. Ultimately, you'd expect it to offer the best graphics performance on the market."" DAMN STRAIGHT. 

""The implication** with this new PC chip for 2025 is that it may well (It WILL, no 'may' it will) debut a new* in-house CPU core design from Nvidia. It would certainly be far more interesting if it did. (it will)That would also enable Nvidia to offer something much more performant than Arm's own CPU core designs.""
aaand = 

""And make no mistake, the Arm instruction set allows for some very high performance CPU cores these days. By some measures, Apple's latest CPU cores in the M4 have 60% better IPC (or performance per clock cycle) than anything Intel or AMD currently offer.""

And these cpu chips to come out officially in September 2025, but anouncement dates and getting market ready will start first half of 2025, likely this ER starts talking about it or beginning of next year... Commercial anouncement will be THE FIRST HALF OF 2025 or first qtr of 2025 yr proper... but you never know, Jensen might pull an early bird push this into the EARLY first half of 2025... Very likely Jensen talks about these babies in this coming CC next Friday?, we'll see. But it's happening either way. And market will value and trade NVDA accordingly. Millions of PC's with NVDA CPU's, as far as I can remember Biden cant block normal PC chips for normal computers to China or anywhere else for that matter.

[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse); Ladies and gents, the top signal is finally here; OP buys short dated nvda calls at the top. Makes this post.  Holds thru earnings. Nvda drops after earnings after on Wednesday market open. OP sells at 90% loss. Nvda rebounds and goes Shrek mode into new ath by close on Friday. OP goes into depression.; How much growth does it have to report to justify its current price? Oh... ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275); 1 guy doing call and the rest going to inverse it into puts. I will inverse most of you by doing calls then; I'm definitely buying puts because of this ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); buying puts thanks; My prediction is it's going to be the same script as the last earning; Believe most analysts have revised price targets to around $175. $200+ seems pretty insane, but then again so is this market. If a picture of Trump wearing a leather jacket or holding an NVDA video card surfaces around earnings maybe it'll hit $250....I mean look at TSLA.; My guy is loaded with 200c to the brim, tryna justify his rash decision buying these calls in the first place by writing a whole damn essay. I like that.; Past 200, what on earth are you smoking. It needs to first justify the price it has, let alone fly past this.

This earnings either proves they deserve this price or it tanks. The expectations are massive. I would not be buying calls.; Caps lock yo....puts it is...; Only if Jensen signs Trump’s tits; Damn. I got in last week for a 12/13 147c for under $7. Was feeling good about pushing low 150s before earnings, then this bad juju nonsense post comes around. Feel like I need to exorcise my calls lmaoo; This is regarded. The AMD PE is inflated due to the xilinx acquisition. Look at non GAAP PE for that but PE is too boomer to use for analysis.; I am just going to hold for this earnings and reluctant to buy more. No idea what will happen.; I love this fucking sub.

Gonna buy calls! Thanks for the DD.; This post makes me sad because I was so excited for my calls. Now, this post just confirmed I shouldn’t have made them.; Somehow OP managed to combine AI with nuclear, got my buy finger hovering on Dec24 300c.; NVDA 30 trillion market cap by next week you heard it here first; Not reading all this, what strike price and expiration date...; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|18630); Can’t wait to see everyone post their gains. Please everyone make sure you bring receipts.; Only thing slowing down NVDA is that Blackwell is sold out through the end of 2025.  **customers who have not yet placed an order with the company won't receive any Blackwell products until late 2025**.; Nvidia will be still up tomorrow, Wednesday, November 13th. But on Thursday, November 14th, and Friday, November 15th, Nvida will be down on both those days. You can buy the dip then. Then, hold through earnings well into December. Nvida does well in Sagittarius season.; After hitting an ATH of $140 on June 20, NVDA dropped down to $90 (-35%) on August 5. Since then it has risen +64% to a new ATM of $149.; TLDR: fuck everyones calls!; The longer the DD the more reason to inverse; Puts it is; https://preview.redd.it/c61e78or7k0e1.jpeg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0446a4cbe5a504f11dcfc0cf1809ccac7f9cad6a; Complacency; What can I say....? I like the stock.; Forward pe less than 12 months ago. Bullish. $130c EOM.; Where is the TLDR; Read a pretty strong analysis of NVDA [https://trendedge.ai/stocks/nasdaq/nvda](https://trendedge.ai/stocks/nasdaq/nvda)  
Things are still looking promising; What about a the cooling problems Nvda customers are having with blackwell?; I agree with everything you said, and to me, the biggest outlier is Taiwan.  I am looking forward to the Foxconn plant opening in Mexico as well as the TSMC plant in AZ.  I do agree it will approach $200 after earnings, and the Forward P/E is still very reasonable.; Why not 300?; In at a call for 152.5 for the 22nd to the moon we go; Bro has fucking puts for sure; OP took out a loan and bought 200c and is shitting his pants right now.; dan ives is a clown; shit idk man, it's up 44% since selling last earnings release.; WHY THE FUCK DO YOU HATE US ALL. YOU BITCH. THE WSB INVERSE mostly WORKS. You posting here is the sign that i need to be worried about my call options 😃😀😄😁😬🙂😐😶😕🙁☹️😔😞🙂‍↕️

And op goes into depression. Sigh. Taxes and Depression, sometimes death. Cannot be escaped. But on the bright side.....; [deleted]; For the PE bitchers and moaners, I leave you this:

AMD Trailing Twelve Month ACTUAL PE is: 126

NVDA Trailing Twelve Month ACTUAL PE is: 69

Chanos bitched and moaned all the way to broke house where he had to close shop. Tesla preaching and evangelizing the PE did him an apostate. He's done. TESLA CRUSHED HIM. Tesla easily slid into it's PE and CHanos is no more. Same thing happened with the bitchers and moaners with Amazon, Google, etc. When a company is a quality company and especially part of the SP500, where every iteration of the that index HAS TO PURCHASE this stock, you ride well.; I will just keep holding the stock. 😂; Do it please!; In what way?; Stop. I can only get so hard.; Bur what stock if he has a banana bag instead?; Why are you listening to analysts' price targets, lol; This market is irrational exuberance nothing needs to be justified it will probably go past 200 just because; But I am. Time to hedge 🫡😎Same argument on PLTR and CRWD . CRWD is some crazy ass PE of over 400 and they blacked out half the country. All trades are forward looking. Not intrinsic value looking. 🛵🚎🚒💺🚝🛸; Sure it does.; not even joking just bought; My authority is not measured in mod powers.

It is measured in magick and witchcraft and runic glory.

Doctor says they're good for me.; OP wrote mostly yap also looking into buying 170c 175c and 180c for Dec6; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); Deep OTM far into the future; 400.; So you have no calls open is what you’re saying and you already sold for profit. 
Profit is profit.; Why didn’t you just sell a same date higher strike, collect the profit:premium and if it expires above both you get the additional upside?; I lost so much money off of that and in the following days. My port was at its all time low.; amds pe is inflated due to Xilinx acquisition. It’s not a comparable indicator; According to my one lazy google search:  
  
AMD Forward PE Ratio : 27.97  
NVDA Forward PE Ratio : 36.16

ok.jpg.  Make it make sense nostradamus.; Tesla has multiple avenues of profit.

NVDA tanked last ER at 130's because the numbers, while good, didn't justify that much growth. It's at 150 now with the only news being a supplier was cooking their books hard. Best of luck! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); Just look at the last earning report and the price of the stock after the release; Lmfao; it's a frame of reference, as is seeing where resistance and support is; ""The implication** will fit VERY well aaaand = snuggly like into your crack pipe.

I have very long dated calls hedging the short dated ones.; Ummm, they are doing Blackwell deliveries now and able to take that revenue.  Demand is ""INSANE"".

So u either love the cooked crack or have some kind of delusion this is somehow negative for your calls? lol. But yeah I get it.

The Inventory is sold out at least a year.  You don’t know WTF you are talking about.; $6.7 billion in inventory, $2.7 billion of which are finished goods (aka GPUs sitting in warehouses) but sure drink that kool aid instead of reading the 10-k yourself. Idiocracy is real ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); \> $6.7 billion in inventory, $2.7 billion of which are finished goods

Thanks. Where do I find that info/source?; That is like 5 days or less of inventory.  Also, probably some older model and slow mover in that.  I am in the AI business, and I am telling you that demand is way out in front of supply, literally at least a year.  Let’s put it into perspective, they will sell $10B or more just in Blackwell this quarter and you are bringing up $2.7B in finished Goods.  Yes, Idiocracy is real.  Just stuff sitting on the Dock waiting to ship is probably $1B or more.  Add in order consolidation for multi-product shipments and you have another batch.; Their 10-k; “5 days or less of inventory”, their ytd revenue through July was $30 billion… do you know how to read a 10-k? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); They are supply Constrained.

I have a buddy who went super hard into crypto when bitcoin broke 60k back in november 2021. he was all about ADA, bit torrent, thought bitcoin would easily eclipse 100k and how he was diamond handing forever. it was, the new future, but in the present.

He sold shortly after when bitcoin fell to near 20k. 

He hasn't talked about it to me for years, and I asked him recently what he thought of bitcoin now that it broke 90k.

He said it would probably fall again and it was due for a pull back.

ie. if it were to match SPY over the past year from this point, it'd need to hit $117K AFTER the run-up from $35k region. Does BTC going up another 35%+ seem likelier and less risky than SPY repeating a 20-35% run? Basically, BTC is simply a more volatile asset so a 220% increase can end with a 40% collapse. Sure you can make money after the initial price blitz upwards, but the higher it gets the more likely you are to hit the top. It could run into January to it's top.

The last 2 bull runs, the peak of the market was reached at: 

7/2016 -> 12/2017 = 17 months

5/2020 -> 3/2021 = 10 months

4/2024 -> ? = I'm guessing peak is anywhere from now to January. 

Look at the [successive peaks on the rainbow chart](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/en/bitcoin-rainbow-chart/) and how they are declining. If I had to bet, I'd say it ends this run anywhere in $105-150k range. It then dips slightly below the purple on the chart to $35-50k range and as time moves on the highs are in that first green and blue green range which would represent about half of the total market cap of all gold by 2028.; No, but this is an *extreme* market reaction that cannot be sustained.  Everyone is thinking it's 2020/2021 again and many are probably about to get burned.; My guy, WE are the grocery store baggers. It's been us all along; I am genuinely curious if the market can even go down at this point 

The momentum of the common people is immense, hedge funds are failing to extract money from them again and again. How will anything go down if even the big boys are not able to cull the peasants? 

Anything short of a full economic bomb is just not going to do shit against a market that is being pumped by every single person that has savings every month.; Whatever this is from sounds amazing. I know I'm missing out.; Bagholder spotted.

MONTHLY.; Same thing that always happens. The market gradually bloats higher due to asset inflation until there's a fresh set of paychecks to double down and accelerate the uptrend. Repeat.; The market must inevitably go up.; Does it rhyme with ""bug bull""? ; I love how people are so close to figuring out BTC is the mother of all ponzies and the reason to get out is because when everyone is in, it lacks value. 

Saying that as someone who has been in since $60. The value is how much you tell bro1 he can sell it to bro2 for then bro 2 to 3 etc. I actually used it to buy stuff and pay rent. Can't do shit now.; > No, we call those people “exit liquidity”

🥇; Trust me, you're premature. At least get back in during the pullback in january before trump gets in.; Is ur wife single?; Almost 9x the amount now 🤯; yes it may be at the point of that time in BTC far beats timing the BTC; The guy isn't asking for the patient's name or anything like that.

It's perfectly legal for the doctor to say they had a patient one time that had X disease and died.; [deleted]; It's pretty rude calling him a hippo; Looks like this isn't publicly listed, next; Are those the republican ones?; You are overestimating the average intelligence… by far.; Ah cool, thanks for the chart. My tired ass just misinterpreted your comment; The market does what ever it wants in spite of what people think will happen.; Its better than 21. In june the us government creates a crypto reserve. It also emerges that satoshi was the CIA. China and the rest of the world panic, and start buying. Bitcoin hits 250k+; *Maybe* total coincidence, but I'd read folks in the crypto subs saying that ""interesting stuff tends to happen"" 6-9 months after the bitcoin 'halving' event that happens every 4 years.

The last halving happened just under 6 months ago, and ETFs for the stuff exists in the US this time.; You're right but i still disagree due to brain bias; Looking at most of the negative PnLs posted, I think you must be right!; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31225); So when the unemployment rate goes up, contributions will go down.

Kinda wild that unemployment andy can afford a cava visit and I’m working full time to buy ramen on clearance.; haha thats what I thought; The realization I’ve had on these mega stocks is that they literally can’t fail

I have told myself for the last five fucking years that Tesla has surely gotten its exit liquidity. I didn’t buy bitcoin at $4000 because the fud got to me.

The stock market has been on the edge of crashing for half a decade. If I would’ve just gone with my gut and invested in companies that I know aren’t going anywhere I would’ve done great. Think about it, millions of people’s 401(k)’s are tied up into these companies. The only way we as a country have managed to hedge our currency against inflation is the market.

I am going to continue to be conservative, but I am fairly confident bitcoin will be at $100,000 and three months and Nvidia will be at 175+. The entire economy is so intertwined with like 15 companies, I don’t think they can let it go tits up.; LOL; The point of Bitcoin is to circumvent financial controls, AML & KYC laws. It does that well regardless of its value. But you can fractionalize it almost infinitely so the value doesn’t mean shit, it’s just nominal and interfaces with dominant currency to support hardware requirements to exist, right? The alternative would be criminal organizations exchanging slips of IOUs. ; Annoyed me too.; Hippo 🦛; Fucking classic.; [deleted]; I’ve had a rough year or two, but I’m also exaggerating too. I’m not starving, but between healthcare and big car repairs your boy is broke as fuck. Just doing my best to protect my port and let it grow slowly, because pushing for quick growth is also pushing for quick losses. 
 
Most I’ve ‘paid’ on healthcare visits is upwards of 10k for an uninsured ER visit, but I let it get sent to collections then disputed the claim, so it fell off.
 
As an aside; disputing collections notices is cheat codes. Tell the 3rd party collector that bought your medical debt that you’ve never contracted with them and that you’re happy to pay the hospital directly instead. They’ll tell you that the hospital tab is closed since they bought it. Then you tell them that’s tough and just kinda check your credit history for a few weeks. 
 
Never not worked.; [deleted]; Appreciate your kindness. America is an odd duck. Everything is expensive and we make good money but not really, unless you accidentally come up with a means of getting fuck-you money, which happens to people regardless of merit here. I think the dedicated or the smart can make it consistently, but even the dumb and the lazy still make it sometimes. 
 
I’m super thankful for the support of my family and friends here; life alone as a young adult is untenable in 2024 America imo. But those that have established themselves often have an easy time sparing a bit of their excess without taking a hit here. Just wanna be able to be the house my generation of family comes to for the holidays and like, that seems incredibly doable."
231,Did anyone on here invest when Apple was almost bankrupt? ,"What is the cheapest the stock got to when they were almost bankrupt before Steve Jobs returned to the company? I'm curious. 

I know most people would not have thought anything of Apple at that time and I'm pretty curious when sentiment was at its lowest. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gpllz1/did_anyone_on_here_invest_when_apple_was_almost/,120,2024-11-12 15:12:27,"I worked for Apple in 03 and had the option to do an espp. My dad advised against it because he said he had no faith in the company and I believed him…..

Oh well. Live and learn.; cheapest it got was around $10, times were bad, the og Mac was over priced and not selling, they had no other winners and Dell compaq gateway etc etc were hitting sales records for desktops, the pepsi era was grim

at the time the only customers apple had was selling to college students and tech lovers, a very very small market, they were the kings of desktop publishing lol 

at the time I had $3k to my name and sat at my desk to write a check to a brokerage to buy something like 200 shares, back then there was no retail online anything other than compuserve, prodigy and AOL were just starting, also high commission due to small account

anywho I distinctly remember laughing at my self for thinking of doing something as stupid as buying 200 shares of a bankrupt company 🤔 I bought ibm instead

years later while watching how popular the og ipod was I thought about buying again but my thought at that time was there are dozens of mp3 players, this apple thing is a fad; Bought our first 1,000 shares of AAPL on 3/12/1997, a month after Jobs returned. 

Cost basis $4,000 at the time. 

I figured, “How many times does a fanatical workaholic visionary genius return to the company he founded in his garage after already changing the world three times (Apple ][, Macintosh, Pixar)? If it goes to $0, we lose $4,000. Not going to change our life in the slightest. But it could go up forever.”

It has. Those shares are currently up 154,434% plus dividends and are now worth $1,500,000, but we bought many, many more through the years and never sold one. 

The greatest turnaround story in the history of business.; Bought my cousin 4 shares of stock for high school graduation.  2 shares of Microsoft, a touch under $50 per share.  2 shares of apple, roughly 0.50 per share.  

He never sold, value of apple was $20,000+ last I looked.  

Imagine if we had only bought $100 in all apple shares.; I bought it in January 2005, still have it.; I have 1000 shares with a basis of $37.50; In the enterprise space - Apple was never a consideration. And my recollection is that general sentiment at the time is that Apple is a consumer grade product which would become crowded. And there were lots of other successful tech companies. We were also seeing a lot of consolidation back in the early '90's and Apple at the time did not believe in growth by acquisition (at least until they acquired NeXT). 

One of the things that people like me never liked about Apple is that it's a closed ecosystem - so it was never a company that I would invest in because I believed that tech companies cannot grow if the company limited third-parties from contributing to innovation. 

It's easy to look in the rear view mirror today - but back then - there were lots of companies that never made it out of the '90's and '00's. Companies like Nantucket, Aston Tate, Lotus, Borland, Novell, Prodigy, AOL, AskJeeves, etc. 

I like to mention AskJeeves because it was an idea that showed the promise of AI and chatbots.; Bought in early 2002 after seeing a friend’s iPod and being amazed. I was in high school lucky to make $100/week and dumped $2000 into it. That has paid for a down payment on a house, a masters degree and still have about 50% of it. My experienced investor dad tried so hard to convince me to sell and diversify and my dumb teen self rebelled and refused. Turns out that particular rebellion was a worthwhile one.; Who wants to buy at lows when you can buy at highs?; I bought $1000 in 1997. I believed in Apple. Great towers like the 9600/200 (mhz!). 

My plan at the time was to use that $1000 investment to fund my new Apple computers for the next 10 years. So I did. Until all the shares were gone by 2010. 

I stuck to my plan and executed it, so I cannot feel bad.  Hey, I didn’t lose money.; No, but worked for Apple during the summer of my first year in college. This was 98. I remember them pitching how we could buy shares at a discount. Nope I said, this company won’t be around much longer.  I drank that money instead.; I didn't.  They were in bad shape in the mid 90s.  Pretty sure Microsoft saved them at some point with an investment of some sort.

Easy to look back and dream.  No one would have guessed this success so it doesn't bother me.; God I wish I had. I really thought about throwing some money at it when it was in danger of being delisted but talked myself out of it because it was “obviously about to fail”.; I did .  Bought AAPL very early on for mid 20s and sold it at loss (high teens), when I heard from employees got retrenched.  I don't regret and had to do what we had to do.; When Microsoft invested in Apple in the ‘90s and ended the bankruptcy threat it was eye opening to me.  You’d assume MSFT would be happy for Apple to disappear at that time but reality was turning out quite different.  It made me think Apple had a better chance than Wall Street realized and it wouldn’t be allowed to fail (ironically, due to Bill Gates).  That was my trigger to put some money in and it’s been a nice ride so far.; One of the few things I did in my miserable motherfucking investing life was, make a large investment in Apple when the iPhone was announced. “Large” was something like $30,000 maybe. But at 10x’ed informed one of the pillars of my sorry, investing life.

Did I buy more on the way up? Of course not, because I already owned some apple. Did I pay attention to the 200 day moving average and by when it got above it or so when it got below it? Of course not.; I told my boss in 1998-99 that Apple at $7 is really good and we should invest in it. I got busy with work and never bought it and neither did my boss. Fast forward I said the same thing about Amazon at 60$. I got busy with work never bought it but my client who I told this to bought 1000 shares and rode it up all the way to 3500. Oh well; Yes, I bought back in 2002 with split adjust cost now $0.43 per share (current price $224). I've held much of this and done very well, though unfortunately have sold shares over the years, so only have about half my original amount. I actually sold a small amount this past year as now taking profits, I am obviously very over-weighted in AAPL and I think other opportunities may do better going forward.

I've always liked and used Apple computers (Macs) since the 1980's, so this really paid off.; Please don’t remind me.  My wife bought me a first gen iPod for Father’s Day  and I thought to myself maybe I should buy some stock. We got a inground pool instead.


There was good reasons not to invest as I remember. We got burned with what little we had invested in Tech in the 90s.  Kids loved that pool though.; I had such bad experiences with Apple when trying to use their machines for engineering research applications that I assumed that they wouldn't make much of what little market share that they had with their computing platforms.  I wasn't completely wrong with this, but the IPhone was a sea change and the real key (along with Jon Ive's design chops and very savvy marketing creating the fanboy world) to their wild growth post 2007/IPPhone intro.; I had 300 sharess  when Microsoft bailed them out .. I sold within one week after that news broke..; I remember when an Apple employee told my parents to buy their stock because they were making the iPhone. 

My parents didn’t. 😂; Why you bring this up?

I was an Apple tech in SF in the 90's before Jobs came back. The stock was trading at less than $20.00.  I had 10k saved up and put it toward a house instead. That investment turned out fine, but still wish I'd bought some.; Not the ""bankruptcy"" days, but I bought some AAPL when the first Iphone came out. Everyone was talking about it and it seemed like the company might grow. And wow what a ride. Still holding. After all the splits, my basis is now approximately $5. 

I wonder if any company today will grow like they did.; I bought in 2007 after I tried an iPhone. I’ve held ever since. Not life changing amount (I was young then) but good portion of my retirement Accout (probably over weighted); I have a client with a $3k basis that is now worth a half million dollars. He also bought Nvidia 10 years ago and never sold. Dude has an extra $1.5M in his account because he just threw darts at the wall; more Nvidia than apple. His Nvidia reasoning was that drones were the way of the future and Nvidia would be the supplier for drone companies; I bought 100 Apple in 1981. They sent me the share certificates home.  Sold a couple of years later.  Doubled my money. 🥲; I bought at $8 a share; Yes, I invested a substantial amount; I bought $1000 worth of Apple stock a month before Jobs returned out of pure luck.  I was a longtime believer in the company and had no idea he would return.  I sold it a couple months later at 100% profit.  No one here ever believes me but no regrets as I made more money over the years with the sale proceeds than if I held.  Still would have been easier if I held but I wouldn’t have the things I do now due to timing issues.; Sentiment was horrible. They weren't putting out competitive computers. The CEO at the time decided to start pushing colorful Imacs thinking pretty things would compete against technologically better things. I know a lot of people disagree, but I feel like they just continued that sentiment once Steve Jobs took over, they just refined it. 

Moore's law determined everyone's stock price in computers back then. Intel was King and AMD was a scrappy underdog who made processors that could double as toasters.

Nobody really expected Apple to do much of anything because they were completely bailed out by Microsoft and the only reason Microsoft bailed them out was to help against all of the antitrust issues that they were having. They were literally propping up a competitor as a sock puppet to prove they weren't the only game in town. Apple as a brand was the back corner of the computer store, quite literally.

The short version is, you wouldn't have invested in them either at that time.; In early 2008 my GF at the time got $50k given to her by her dad and she asked me where to invest it.  I told her to park it in Apple which was under $100 at the time.  She didn’t.  Would be worth around $3.4M today; You’d have been brave. They were turning out some absolute gash hardware, even though their OS was good.; nearly put $3000 in 1994; Not the same time frame, but I bought in 2007 and panic sold in 2009. 

On a positive note, I made all the noob mistakes when my net worth was in the thousands. Those lessons made me avoid the land mines during the pandemic and just DCA into ETFs; Fun story, back when itunes first came out I told my dad who was a investment person about how 99 cents a song is awesome because I would go to record stores and have to buy an entire album just for a few songs I liked. He said they it wouldnt be worth investing in apple because they were in the dumps and how they fired steve jobs and etc. He didnt like reminding him of how it was a stupid idea NOT to buy the stock back then. 😃; we had apple 2+ in school, 1982; I still have it with an average of $10 a share excluding the dividends I’ve received al these years; My in laws have been in since the start. Same with Starbucks.; I bought right before the iPod released and it was around $13 a share.; Yup. Still holding some stock from around 2003.; I did! Apple was the first stock I ever bought, back in 1998. Bought 100 shares for $3000 when Steve became CEO again. A lot of money for me at the time, but I believed! The stock promptly dropped down to $8. A few months later, Apple struck a deal with Microsoft, who needed Apple to stay in business as part of its monopoly settlement. Stock promptly shot back up to $30 and I was very happy to sell. After the dot com crash of 2000, it dropped back down to $6 and I felt lucky to have gotten out. It would be worth $4-5 million today.; I bought $3000 in 2002ish @ $17.23. Thought iPods would be a thing.; My parents are in AAPL at something like $24/share. Retirement is going well for them.; I bought at a split adjusted $0.25/share.; I had bought a bunch in early 2002 at something like $4/share (pre split adjusted). 

Unfortunately my wife works for a Big 4 firm and they won the Apple audit business a couple of years later and we were required to sell the shares (no one that works for them can own it). 

Having done the math, that has costs us multiple 7-figures.; Cheapest stock I’ve got was AAMRQ when they were going bankrupt for an avg of $0.32 and I sold it all after it changed to AAL for ~$55. Best $5k I’ve ever spent.; I bought 200 shares in 2005.; I have some shares at $5 split adjusted; [removed]; I swear I bought some Apple in about 2005, but I probably sold the old shares off when I needed cash to pay for something. I still have many shares going back to 2012. By letting them sit there in a drip, I have made $60K.

Edit to add the current cost basis is about $37.; no I am a poor person; I went to Siggraph the year Jobs returned to Apple. He was a last minute addition to speak. As a starving college student I had no cash to buy stocks and this was before E*trade and the like so it wasn’t exactly easy. 

I told anyone who would listen they should buy some shares. I think it was like $7-ish a share or something in the neighborhood of ¢35 account for splits. ; I started buying after the first ipod.. around 20 21; I am investing in Joby and ACHR and they are burning cash... But it's gonna fly; I bought Apple at $98/share right after the 2008 crash.; Green Mountain Coffee Roasters ($GMCR) around 2009-10 just as Keurigs were getting hot.; Yes, I invested just before it started rising. Unfortunately, it wasn’t Apple I invested in. It was palm pilot.; 2011.. wife bought a few shares.. still have them.

Nothing compared to some folks who bought much lower, but has turned out pretty well.; I owned apple back in the early to mid 80’s..  it was when IBM PCs were bashing the hell out of apple and I watch the stock slide down..  maybe $13 IIRC…. 

When it made it back up to my buy in price, I sold it….  Obviously never became an apple fanboy so I never got on board with iPods, phones etc….  End of story; The last time I checked on my Apple I was up something like +407% give or take a few points. I don't even pay attention to it. I just let the automatic DRIP do its thing.; The lesson is, always gamble on stocks in case they blow up.; my parents worked for/with apple in the 70s-90s and were compensated with a lot of stock. they sold almost all of it off over the late 90s and early 2000s before the ipod came out because they were disillusioned with the company and the leadership. iirc I checked a few years ago when apple first hit $1T market cap and it would have been worth something like $50m+ dollars.; Me too dude! I was working there when we did OSX and the stock was at 6$ a share, but I was too young to gamble with my money. I don’t think people realize that we didn’t always get paid ridiculous salaries at that time.; I want to say my parents were interested in investing in Walmart in the mid 80s, but their broker advised against it. Looks like it's gone up 20,000% since.

Speaking of Apple though, this post sparked up memories when we were running MacOS on non Apple hardware in the late 90s prior to Jobs reorganizing everything. Unheard of today!; In your dad's defense, an ESPP on any arbitrary company would have on average underperformed the S&P 500 over the past 20 years.

You just happened to work at one of the few companies that massively out-performed it, but hindsight is 20/20 and you can't beat yourself up over decisions you made based off knowledge you didn't have at the time.; I had to check this one. Apple was $0.33/shr adjusted in 11/2003, and $224 today.; Buy when others are fearful; If there's one thing I've learned, it's to never trust anyone in older generations on tech investments.

I invested TSLA when they were very new at $30, and on the advice of someone 30 years older than me (a co-worker), I cashed it out at around $125. He said ""well I think you've made enough on your original investment.""

I very quickly realized my mistake and bought it all back (and more) and then sold it years later for an insane 1,000%+ profit, but I was young and naive and thought it best to trust someone merely because they were older than me, when that person knew nothing about investing.

The lesson for me? I learned to trust my own intuition and research over anyone else's casual advice.; People also forget during the iPod craze, there were many other mp3 players on the market. The original iPod also only worked on the Mac platform. It wasn't an obvious runaway with Apple. The iPhone stage was also masked by the fact almost everyone in business used a Blackberry, many said they would never switch from a tactile keyboard to one on screen. It's not always as obvious in the moment as it is looking back.; Those early iPods were absolutely terrible and I hated even trying to use them whenever a friend showed me theirs. I also hate the Apple TV remote, and love Roku's remote design.

Yet people have some weird fascination about Apple products like they must inherently be better; or they'll be judged as poor for not having them. 

iPhones are pretty solid though, I'll grant that. Still happy with my Pixel.

And my Grandma is living off the Apple shares she bought 20+ years ago.; $10, not adjusted for splits; How do you control yourself to not sell? I tend to be stuck in between thinking I'm holding for long term and then selling as soon as I hit say 50% return just to lock in profit. Been burnt by crypto so much I just take profits whenever I can, but long term might not be a good approach.; Nice. What kind of dividends are you making on AAPL?; Wow, how many?; My cost basis is $30.45. Unfortunately, I only have 62 shares.; I remember. I was a huge Microsoft guy. My dad bought a Hewlett Packard back then and then got me one. I was a gamer back then so I remember I got a Hewlett Packard with an Nvidia graphics card to play Terminal Velocity, Doom, & Descent. I hated they were a closed ecosystem back then because if I bought an Apple Mac back then I couldn't play my games and thought it was more expensive anyways.

I remember AskJeeves also. I used to use that one and Yahoo! back in ........ 1997-98 I think it was. When Google came out I vividly remember my computer 1 teacher telling me about this really good search engine called ""Google"" that was better than Metacrawler which is what I used. I never went back to Metacrawler when I learned about Google.; How is dad today?; [deleted]; Nothing to feel bad about. That’s money you would have spent anyway, and that’s what investments are for. It’s just reallocating funds. Other thing you should be proud of is you had a specific exit plan that you stuck with. Most people don’t even have an exit plan.; At the time I was hard-core in the Apple ecosphere, buying a power Mac 7500 with money I had made for my side business selling anime products, which eventually turned into a serious business that we’ve been running for 30 years so far. My wife was floored that I had made enough money to buy a whole computer.

So I was quite in touch with what was good or wasn’t good about Apple at the time. We all knew, whatever happened, we would never stop using Apple products, even when they were quite shitty.; I feel like stocks are like that. When Netflix was losing subscribers people all the sudden considered them low quality shows.... All of the sudden. Boy if you go into them back then also lol I guess the equivalent would be a company like Intel... I can't think of anything else right now that has gotten annihilated by losing market share and everything. Not saying there's any hope or that they're going out of business but it's sometimes impossible to see a company return to a strong presence.


When did you start buying shares? In my mind I probably wouldn't have bought when they were going out of business either..... maybe when the iPod came out. When that came out it was a huge deal. I'm not an Apple guy. I'm more of a Microsoft person but even I bought that and still never had a Zune. Almost ended up buying into the Apple ecosystem back then also.; Today they saved OpenAI; So... what's that next company you won't take time to buy being to busy?; I'd bought $2000 worth of AAPL in May 2007: sold it in December 2011, sad; Lady fortuna; Those colorful Macs (the original iMac) was a part of Jobs’ comeback. The other big thing he did was cut down the number of product lines, which had spiraled out of control and was extremely confusing to customers, to just 4 (consumer desktop/laptop, pro desktop/laptop).

The appeal of the iMac (and later iBook) wasn’t that they were powerful, but that they had been simplified as far as technologically feasible at that point and the fastest way to get onto the internet — they had an ad campaign talking about how the iMac needed only two cables to connect to the internet for example. The iBook was also among the very first consumer-oriented laptops to be equipped with WiFi, where in the PC world that was found only in higher end models or bolted on with a bulky PC Card upgrade.

While Apple wouldn’t start shooting upwards in popularity until years later when the iPod gained Windows compatibility, the product line simplification and introduction of the iMac/iBook at least put the company in a position where it could keep its head above water after the floaty that Microsoft tossed them had dissolved.; I remember showing the 1st gen iPod to my dad. He could not understand why I was so exited. I tried to explain and told him to buy some stocks. He didn't obviously... neither did I but I was 18 with no much money at a time when buying stocks was not as easy as today. Even less for us Europeans. I like to remind him of that day and I guess I should have invest in Apple instead of the ipod which was something like 500 EUR back then.; Should have sold it to your mom or dad; Your submission was automatically removed because it contains a keyword not suitable for /r/investing.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/investing) if you have any questions or concerns.*; I liked Apple Macs. The first I used IIRC was Macintosh II. I played the hell out of Oregon Trail. When I asked my teacher if I can borrow the game he asked if I owned an apple and didn't understand why. Never bought a Mac. I did have an iPod and almost got a Mac but really to this day it's just I was always a fan of Microsoft more when it came to technology. When that rivalry was going on and that commercial came up with Apple/Microsoft as people (Apple was the laid back guy, Microsoft was the computer nerd) I felt attacked.... even though yes I was a computer nerd EASILY lol; That’s why I’m in etf’s now 🤣 i can’t pick a winner to save my life.; 100% my takeaway; Just think how much Steve Wozniak lost; And it wasn't like you could just buy stock on your phone. You had to call Charles Schwab or go to a physical office.; And if you had 100k in your brokerage account back then, how much would you put in Apple?; Hacintosh?; I had one of those. It was called a “Power PC”; That’s why I laugh about it. The chances of me holding it all these years were slim to none too. It’s a fun story though; 224 with their stock splits in 2014 and 2020 I think it was lol would have been crazy. I guess you never know.

I wanted to ask this because we were talking about how much market share Intel lost.; Damn. When I worked at a Fortune 100, I bought like $200 of stock via their ESPP every month.

Assuming a similar amount of investing, that’s about 400 shares every year. Just from that first year it would’ve been $89,000 of investments.; Calculate historical Apple purchase at today's share price

https://finlo.io/stock-calculator/AAPL; The lesson is you lucked out; I remember swearing I’d never leave my Windows mobile with a keyboard. I insisted a full keyboard was the only way I’d ever operate a cellphone…; I would say it’s mostly that Apple products really click with some people at the cost of not appealing to others. It’s not a conventional strategy, but it’s evidently working based on the money they’re raking in.

The status/judgement thing happens, but the crowd that totes around an iPhone as a status symbol only has a relatively small intersection with those who just like the products and I think it’s good to keep that distinction in mind.; >Those early iPods were absolutely terrible

Huh? Their hardware design was incredible. It was a Porsche in the time where everything else was a AMC Gremlin.; I don't need the money. We sell a few hundred shares every year to fund our lifestyle now that we're retired, but with dividend re-investment, they are replenished soon enough. 

We also bought our first share of Berkshire Hathaway in about 2000, when it was ""only"" $68,000/share. Now we own four, and it's at $700k.

Like Buffet says, ""My preferred stock holding period is forever.""

Buy and hold.; AAPL pays $0.25/share (0.45%) quarterly. With our 33,000 shares, at the current share price of around $225, we get around 140 free shares every year.; $250 / $1.15~; This is the part of investing that frustrates me to no end. Even if you can afford to get in at the right time, it’s still basically worthless if you can’t afford large sums. 

Takes money to make money.; Descent was my favorite video game. 

It's interesting that you mentioned you had a Nvidia card. Back in the '90's - the darling graphics card company was ATI which went public in the early '90's at least 5 years before Nvidia IPO'd. 

The problem with AAPL also is that there were a lot of high-end workstation companies that could have started to put out a consumer grade workstation. If companies like Sun, Apollo, SGI, (maybe even DEC) started to enter the consumer market - we may have seen a very different tech landscape today. 

I always thought that the attempt by NeXT to bridge consumer and high-end workstation market was interesting. I had a NeXT workstation which I enjoyed working on.; Funny thing, for a few years in the 90s Macs shipped with a copy of an enhanced (resolution bumped to 640x480, new CD-quality soundtrack) version of Descent included. The Performa tower my parents bought in 1996 had it and it ran well.; All good! Diversification treated him well and every once in a while I get a jab in about how I’ve outperformed him in the markets.; Not at all, worked my ass off and kept saving. Just had an opportunity to buy a house younger than I would have mostly and will have the chance to retire much earlier than if I had skipped the investment overall.; Intel is a good one for the moment.

Nike is another. Has been totally decimated and it’s hard to see light at the end of the tunnel. 

Ford is another. Their stock is absolute trash but they could perhaps find an “iPhone” and turn it around.; Ha ha.; Intel maybe; Jobes also switched from the motorola micoproceesor they were using to Intel micorprocessros.  At the time apple started the motorola processor was one of the best on the market.  But IBM went with intel and IBM closes also used intel.  So intel got a lot of money that allowed they to rapidly improved the processor.  And many design software progams Needed to faster intel chips.  switching chips was not easy the the circuit boards have to be redesigned and the software had to be rewritten.  to be compatible with the new chip.  with that change the performance of apple computers took a big jump up in performance.; I didn't remember that the colorful imacs was jobs. It was seemingly a seriously dumb move to sell pretty as opposed to powerful at that time. It has been awhile so my memory isn't obviously the best, but the rest is pretty true. Apple at the time looked like it was going to fade from view like the Amiga. Important a long time ago, and fading into obscurity.; Yeah, had I known that would have made sense. But at the time (this was pre iPhone) I was fine having made a small profit and moving on. Was annoying but not like this.

This also assumes I would have held it the entire time. Not sure that would have been the case.; At the time , Gateway computers and Compaq were hot lol.; Way before Hackintosh. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe Hackintosh is getting OSX to run on non Apple x86 hardware. I was referring to the clones that were available in the mid 90s. Power Computing was a popular brand that we ran in our office at the time. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_clone looks to cover it. That was a long time ago, so my memory is a little vague :D; Partially, yes - I won't deny that.

But my action in re-investing after quickly realizing my mistake is what saved me. Had I blindly listened to his advice I'd have made 3 figures as opposed to 5. All a matter of perspective, I suppose.; Agree with this. It was so elegant compared to other products in the category at the time.; Amazing story.  Thank you.  Congratulation. You are one of the smartest people I know.; Fantastic mate. Congratulations and well done!; Probably my biggest takeaway when I began investing 10 years ago as well; I bought my 1000 shares on a monthly investment over a few years, I have it as low as $21.25. This was not a lump sum purchase; Actually RKLB andHOOD  are probably better choices..; My point is that people with money tend not to put that much in dicey stocks. I have a friend who had perhaps a million in the late 90s who put 5k in Microsoft and 5k in another company that went bankrupt. Now the 5k in MSFT is over 100k. The 5k in the bankrupt company went to zero, so 10k went to 100k in 26 years.; I remember we had one that was able to boot to Mac or windows 3.1, very strange.; So what is your exit strategy on tsla? Or are you planning to hold it forever?; Right place, right time. 

I learned the “it can only go to zero, but it can go up forever” from my dad. 

He bought $400 of Chrysler stock for $0.25/share the night before the US Government bailed them out. He said, “It’s an election year and Chrysler has 380,000 union workers. The government is NOT going to let them go out of business. It can only go to $0.00, but if it does and they are in bankruptcy, I am at the front of the line as a secured creditor. It can go up forever.” 

Then a young guy named Lee Iacocca was put in as CEO. All he did when he was at his old job at Ford was design the Mustang. A year later, Lee introduced the K-Car and the minivan. He was on TV ads telling buyers, “If you don’t love it, I’ll buy it back.” 

Chrysler stock went to $68/share by the time my dad sold in retirement for a cool 27,000% gain and $108,400 in profit, plus dividends.; Another example is Ford during the 2008 recession. 

Their stock went to $2/share. They were the only one of the Big 3 who didn’t take a government bailout, and they had the best-selling vehicle in North America for 40 years running — the F-150. They were not going to go out of business. 

We bought $12,000 worth for $2/share and collected dividends for the past 16 years. 

It’s now at $11 and still pays a 5.4% dividend. Our $12k is worth $45,000 now. Wish we had bought more.; Maybe Robinhood but not Rocket Labs. 

Robinhood is only a few points above it's historical lows. Rocket Labs is above its IPO and not too far away from the ATH.

Meanwhile, Apple in 2003 was down over 60% off it's high in 2000. No one was expecting it's absolute dominance coming from a total redesign to it's infrastructure and product offerings. Apple's rise was really something for the ages. In retrospect, it was simple and brilliant, but few companies have actually turned things around in such a way.; Great insight. Thanks; Sold it - bought a car with it (not a Tesla, ironically); Both stories only support the fact that you are one of the smartest people I know. For everyone one story you publish I have 2 stories of terrible errors I made selling to quickly or making stupid risks.  Like today I want to short some stocks but earning potential is only 100% and Warren buffet says never go against the market. Buying stock can earn more than 100%.  

If I would have just purchased VOO from day one or never sold any one of my stocks I would be sitting as good as you. I would be retired today.; True about RKLB, but they are a long-term play as their industry is nascent and they have extremely skilled leadership.

Robinhood has a reputational problem that will take many years to recover from (Nike and Ford for example still have good reputations generally speaking). Not sure if Robinhood has the right leadership in place.; The real insight is that while the msft did well, it didn’t have a big effect on his portfolio. It was the other 990k that mattered. Think about the 990k. If you’re only willing to put 1% in something, don’t bother.; Right, but neither of those are industries like Apple in 2003.

In 2003, Apple was a niche home computing company, with even smaller B2B division. It had resurrected its profitabilty by reducing its offerings, not really expanding. 

But... it had recently just released the iPod (a novel, but lackluster product) and then the iTunes Store. Suddenly, it had a cash cow that revolutionized the game and went on to develop the market that would become dominated by the iPod. Then the iPhone and App Store shortly afterwards.

It's hard to say in 2003, that Apple would've been that behemoth and back then someone on a thread like this would be saying something like ""look at what the company has produced in the last 23 years: lackluster performance.""

So, in a way, for the closest comparison we should be looking at a company that's about 25-30 years old, IPOed about 20 years ago, and has just recently returned to profitability and released new products within the last 2 or so years, that might just go on to develop a whole new market space."
232,NVDA has become the largest position in retail portfolios in the first half of the year,"Data on the 15 most widely held stocks and ETFs in retail portfolios and sorted by weight, NVDA tops the list with a 9.3% weighting over other popular stocks. Such as Apple, S&P 500 EFT, Tesla, Nasdaq 100 EFF, Meta, and others.

This compares to NVDA's 4.2% weighting in the average retail portfolio a year ago

NVDA's popularity is largely due to its rapidly rising stock price, earnings reports that have repeatedly beaten expectations, and retail investors' preference for tech stocks - over the past year, NVDA's stock price has risen 203%, and in the second quarter, NVDA's revenues of $30 billion were up 15% sequentially and 122% year-on-year, well above the $28 billion estimate",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gp0l4n/nvda_has_become_the_largest_position_in_retail/,218,2024-11-11 20:21:20,"NVDA is also the largest company in the S&P 500 now; If the stock tripled this year, the stock will become a larger position so 4.2% into 9.3% is pretty spot on to account for some sales.; I'd say. My initial investment in Nvidia that I had not sold was about $900 (made sometimes in maybe 2014-15). That is now 200 shares. It's by far my single largest position by a huge margin.; I wanted to buy Nvidia way back. But I also wanted a new gaming pc. I bought a gtx 680 instead.

If I had put that 680 money into the stock..... I'm gonna go drink.; Rug pull coming soon. The world hates retail investors; Yea I stepped in this spring, should have years ago, I’m a knot head; Not that I’m complaining, didn’t plan for it to be such a big percentage of my portfolio… I bought early though and not planning to sell till retirement.; I rotated out of tech last week. This shits about to go timber so hard.; Time to buy puts on nvda 😮‍💨; Makes sense. My personal opinion is that it's overvalued but there's so many retail investors buying it regardless, and it's weighted highly in many popular ETF's causing the price to continue rising as everyone stocks up on them. It falls into a lot of etf categories.; Why wouldn’t it be; This is gonna end so badly.; The new stars now are tsla and pltr.; Yeah; Same; You bought in early; I was thinking to do the same. Instead, I bought a gtx 1070, lol ; Same boat…really wish I bought more back then. Bought in like 2017. With the stock splits I’m at 200 shares with an avg cost of ~$4 a share; Was curious so looked it up. 680 launched March 22, 2012 for $500. NVDA was $0.33 that day.

If you bought MVDA shares instead of the 680 it’d be worth $220k.; So choices matter don’t they.  lol; We need to stick together; Don’t worry man I’m still holding 20k nvda; It’s not a bad thing that you bought early at a low cost and large percentage 
The most important thing is value; Wouldn't be so sure of this. Tech is very much still the future and unless something unexpected happens I think we are still on an upward path; Yeah; Really?; Not a bad strategy as long as it's not too far down since it goes up and down; I've been considering it for earnings on the 21st. I think expectations are so high that they could drop on even great numbers. I'm just hoping to see a fomo rally leading up to earnings before I pull the trigger.; It’s kind of like buying bitcoin, only it’s tied to an actually useful tech.; Yeah it’s the most popular stock among retail investors; Why ? Their earnings are good. The growth can slow down a bit but they keep growing.; Maybe; rddt; Correct pltr I’ve been following since October; AMD, next year! 


People will shun it now @ 150. At 300, it'll be popular. At 500, it'll be #1 position in retail portfolios.. just like NVDA is now.


Btw, pls share the source of the data. Wondering who #2 and #3 are.; Everyone thinks so.  lol; How many GTX680 can you get for 220k?; That is some cryptocurrency level gains for a company that was quite well established at that time already, wtf.; I am a dope, I held my amd shares in the gpu wars knowing nvda was stiff competition…yesh; Dont let anyone else know, they might drive the price up.; Tech is still the future I agree; People said the same thing before dotcom.

Tech is valued at GFC levels right now.; I mean everything else pumped like crazy after the elections but nvda fr I was expecting that to run up it gotta be something why they didn’t dump into it; I don’t think there’s much to worry about; You’re right; I am betting on this long term.  I'm not really concerned about this going up or down short term.  

It's been going up really well.  Started rocky.  I think their next earning will slow down a bit.  I see the ads now are not mostly from big companies.  Some no names I don't even know compared to last month.  

I want to add PLTR but not really sure yet.; These two stocks have been going up last week and this week.  Reminds me a bit of nvdia run up earlier this year.  

Not sure about PLTR but TSLA hasn't shown any signs of slowing down yet.

I see a lot of articles on yahoo finance about these two stocks.  I even see PLTR being compared to NVDA.

I've been watching these 2 everyday.; problem is, AMD isn't nearly as useful atm. They're lagging behind in AI useability.


Trying to catch up but... not there yet and not sure when that'll happen if it happens.; AMD won’t scale revenues as much as Nvidia and isn’t as profitable. Their GPU margin is about 54% compared with about 75% for Nvidia; You guys are confirming what I wrote. Skepticism @ 150.. I'll watch the narrative change 180 degrees next year.

RemindMe! 1 year.; Let’s just say it takes time; Like at least 3; Yea nvda is more popular; What catalyst would cause this ""crash"". You reference the GFC, which was a domino effect of the mortgage crisis. Tech is flying high but the sales back up the valuations, in many companies, not all.; I'm guessing the tariff plans may have gave Nvidia some brakes but it is kinda high; Many articles are very bullish on PLTR at the moment 
It seems to be backed by government money

|-|-|-|-|; Missed opportunity; Many plans revolve around it; Congrats! That's still a good price to get in.  

Next year will be mostly TSLA and NVDA.  and maybe PLTR if it keeps performing well.; Trust him bro.; There’ll be another chance; Do you hold them too?; Honestly I'm still undecided.  It's hard to tell since we are in a bull market.  Especially now that Trump won.  Most of the stocks are really high up.  Hard to filter the noise.  

I'm just gonna observe.  I remember my co workers got burned last time this went up and they exited at a lost.  That's what usually happens if you are not familiar with how the company works/operates.  They get scared when the stock goes down.; Yeah this is both an opportunity and a risk"
233,US Tech Stocks will push back against EU pressure as Trump signals tariffs and 'America First' policies,"Honestly, it feels like Apple and the whole US tech sector are finally standing up to the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) and all the over-the-top regulations. With Trump hinting at tariffs and pushing that ""America First"" vibe, the U.S. tech giants might finally have the leverage to say ""no thanks"" to a lot of the stuff Europe’s trying to force on them. The DMA is supposed to keep things competitive, but for companies like Apple, it’s just restrictive and honestly impacts their ability to innovate. If the U.S. government throws its weight behind them, these companies could really start pulling back from Europe’s grip and go about their business without being bogged down by EU red tape.



Europe’s supposed to be an innovation hub, but it’s really starting to look like the opposite. For startups, the endless admin, complex regulations, and sky-high taxes make it pretty much impossible to thrive. You have great ideas coming out of Europe, but the bureaucracy and costs just suffocate them before they can take off. Compare that to the U.S., where taxes are lower and there’s way less red tape, and you can see why so many are ditching Europe altogether. It’s like the EU’s digging its own grave when it comes to tech innovation, and the U.S. might be there to pick up the pieces.

Nasdaq is up 30% YTD and you just realized now is the time to go long tech?; Say what you will about the EU and tech in the pure perspective of economics and the stock market. But as a human being, a little bit of balance to keep companies in check is something that I applaud the EU for.; This feels like ChatGPT delivering a techbro pitch on anarcho-capitalism, similar to those guys who say anything to get a girl into bed and then disappear. However, there's a key distinction: OP is almost guaranteed to be an average Joe, not a techbro, meaning he has no real ability to enjoy the fruits of his own pitch—only to suffer its consequences.

No? It's exactly the opposite. Precisely because there is a threat of tariffs on North American products, which would become more expensive in the EU, these companies obviously don't want to be constantly paying fines to the EU, on top of the tariffs they already will have to pay, right?

And precisely because there are tense relations between the EU and America, it is most likely that there will be a harsh response to non-compliance with standards as a kind of retaliation of hatred on the part of the Europeans.

Businesses know they will be caught in the crossfire, and they know that Trump obviously can't solve these problems, if anything he's will only making them worse with the things he says about the EU.

And what the hell are they going to do? Leave the European market? The 2nd largest economy in the world with 400 million high-income consumers?

>Europe’s supposed to be an innovation hub, but it’s really starting to look like the opposite.

This is nothing new, I don't understand what the title has to do with this

If anything, American protectionism would also benefit hegemonic American sectors in Europe as it would give European growth space to sectors that would normally be at a disadvantage, but would not, because of retaliatory tariffs and sanctions.

>it's time to heavily long US Tech Stocks imo 

Trump's policies are policies that will strongly favor companies at the expense of Americans, so I would say yes, it is time to invest in America as stocks will explode for a few years.; Over the top regulations?; Do you have any examples of what regulations being pushed back on would provide a tailwind? You make a lot of claims but calling out specific examples would be a good way to support your hypothesis. 

Half of EUs lawsuits against big tech are anti-trust which protects EU companies and consumers. And it’s pretty telling that instead of stopping service in those areas, they pay the fine, make some changes, and move on.; No they will not, there is just some rules you need to follow if you want to be in EU and most of those rules are good and protect the users, maybe you instead should hope USA improve on that, so USA is not made for companies first and civilians last.; If EU retaliates in kind to Tariffs you may see even more active measures from them on US tech (same from China, would it only be because they are still critical in some supply chains like Apple's).

That may shrink US tech target adressable markets, or increase their cost base in some of their non domestic markets (to comply with regulations). Open borders and low frictions to scale beyond the US is also what allowed these companies to establish a market share beyond the US and dominate the local, non US competition. 

They do provide superior products overall but do not forget that if they are kneecaped that could reshuffle the cards somewhat. I am not saying this will happen but this is a scenario that you shouldn't discount that easily.; Less regulations is always good 100% of the time. Enable the parasite to help the host. Ignore Upton Sinclair. There is no nuance here.; EU on this i think is better, and you can't innovate at the cost of privacy I think.
Anyhow it's wrong to believe that EU won't ""fight"" the tariffs Trump is saying, consider that EU looses business with most countries because of US embargoes, that in a new context would be opened ( I don't think and i hope EU doesn't do that kind of things anyway). So by isolating a country from commerce it would be a loose loose. I hope they come to terms and say we net our commerce, and that would increase economy both sides.
Tech included; Or, if Trump goes overboard with his trade war, the EU can just ban the EU tech companies, finally allowing domestic ones to emerge. It's not like a search engine and a social network are hard to do in 2024.; 30% is nothing with easier regulations; Me too. ; Agreed. We know the US will always bow down so at least some regulatory body is trying to do something; It’s pretty telling when these companies pay the fine, make a few changes, and then move on. 

But weirdly some people will tell you that every tech service is a convo away from pulling out of the EU lol.; Yeah - us from the EU are actually happy that at least one region is taking steps to regulate their behavior.; Agree.; without the EU, we wouldn't even have GDPR. literally every protection we have on the internet, is SOLELY because it was cheaper for tech companies to just add those features for all users

I applaud them! I work in security btw, which is always a useless pain in the ass, and yes can be overly restrictive....but there will come a day when you need it, and you'll be glad it's there

EU regulations are the same way; But hurting jobs and retirement savings is even worse. ; The balance in question being 

No ecosystem integration for tech companies like Apple

Cannot push AI productivity because they are afraid of layoffs and cannot paid unemployed to everyone

Social system in decline so they push the privacy narrative while also wanted to break encryption for ""our own good""  
  
how human is that; Flair as Industry Discussion, you know what discussion means ?; EU is too weak, they are at the verge of civil war, with tech jobs also going dry over there it's a matter of time for them to relax a lot of their demands; Which don't make sense for most of what I saw in the tech sector, innovation must accelerate; Yes in particular the AI Act,

It's a huge sector with massive implication on the health, legal and many desk jobs sector 

EU is against that kind of innovation since they are not ready to have thousands of layoffs they would rather put humans to write with pen and paper, it's happening now and only the heavy regulations block a lot of companies from increased productivity; See my other comment on EU regulations  that sabotage their productivity because they are not ready to accelerate; Most governments run on Microsoft tech. That alone makes this an unlikely scenario.; Yeah with major countries in Europe having $MSFT (Azure) as health hub, let me laugh; 30% is insane. Besides, those tariffs, combined with his other policies could actually cause a recession, so there's a good chance that the gains under Trump will be nowhere near that number - or even negative.; Doesn't China count? /S; Most European countries don't have stock-based retirement systems, at least not something along the lines of a 401k.; Welp... someone doesn't really understand the EU privacy laws huh?

I'm not arguing they aren't bad for business to some extent, but not in the way you're claiming. They also protect the consumer from targeted psychological marketing and data farming. 

Data is the new currency. When companies take it from you they are taking money out of your pocket. Thats where the extra revenue comes from. If data collection were more restricted, companies would be forced to actually pay us for the value we provide to them and wouldn't be able to build such frighteningly accurate consumer models of individuals. 

Did you know that, as an American, it is nearly certain there are at least a handful of companies out there that know almost every aspect of your life and psychological profile and actively use that to sell things to you? Even if they can't, they sell that personal info to others who think they can. 

So the argument comes down to individual autonomy, privacy, and freedom vs corporate profits.

I don't like overarching regulation, but people have proven that greed will never police itself.; Civil war? Really? Take it down a notch.; >EU is too weak, they are at the verge of civil war

Is the Trump and Russia propaganda so ingrained in your ass that you say shit like this with such certainty? You mental?

>with tech jobs also going dry over there

This man is crazy

My friend, I live in the EU, and I assure you, from the bottom of my heart, that we are not in a civil war, that the EU is not at all weak in economic matters and that we have, believe it or not, a lot of work in the technology sector. 

The EU usually becomes more united when there is a common enemy, Trump only serves as ammunition for a more united Europe. Do you realize that?

^(this fucker is from my country, Portugal, and is saying stupid shit like this wtf?); I'm in Europe, and you've been looking at too much Fox propaganda if you think ""they are at the verge of civil war"". Most politicians here would get a boost to their popularity if they banned some US tech companies.

Yes, Europe regulates heavily, but it's what the population wants. And yes we also recognise that this needs to be balanced with economic growth.; Lol, you are living in an alternate reality if you think EU is on the verge of civil war.

In another comment you say you are from EU but I seriously doubt that.

First, if countries in the EU went to war with each other it wouldn't be a civil war. It would just be a war. I think you read too many dumb Musk tweets there.

Second, Trump presidecy likely means EU will be more united than before.

Third, if you want innovation within EU as you said in another comment then protectionism is good for EU.; There was an insurrection and attempt to overturn the election which a 3rd of the US population keeps downplaying/denying or is just ok with. 
There's a fascist playbook ready for the incoming administration to apply.
Basicly all former staff, including decorated generals, warned that you're putting a wannabe dictator back in charge.
....

I'm thinking the US is much closer to resigning their global dominance and a civil war.; But wasn't it about consumer data and protection. I remember also EU taxing apple for the ireland headquarters thing; Oh they don't need to ban them completely. They can just ban google search, or facebook. Sure, the USA can retaliate and ban them completely but the idea is the EU is not completely toothless.; Yeah, I now think the chances of us seeing a 2018-esque replay for 2026 are being underrated.


I wouldn't have a different mindset the other way as well and frankly this would probably be the better option over what I think is also possible. I think option B is that we get as close to the 2020-2021 environment as you can without ZIRP, then Trump holds the bag of the first secular bear market since the early 00's later in his term.; I'm in tech sector in the EU, I won't dox myself but I see the numbers and it's bad  
I don't need to watch Fox and any propaganda to see that

I too enjoy the social aspect of EU but here it's all about innovation, which we LACK; See my comment above; >In another comment you say you are from EU but I seriously doubt that.

He is, he's from fucking Portugal of all places

I'm also from Portugal. But I live in the peaceful part of the country. Understand that while I woke up today and went to university worried about my exams, he woke up, grabbed his SCAR and went to fight the communists worried about their victory in the European civil war.; See my comment history, then apologize then think for 30 seconds about the recent events in EU, united in poverty maybe; it wont be a civil war..  trump will control the US military.  it will be an ethnic cleansing.; Ireland did not comply with European taxation law. So the EU forced these companies to pay the Irish government years of unpaid taxes.; I think option B, personally. Time will tell; I think you are mistaking fairly local issues in one specific industry with the entirety of the EU. I get it, it is easy to get sucked into your own industry and what you work with, but you must realize that, even though your industry may be important, it is not everything. Your comment about some supposed civil war is absurd, and to be frank, quite childish. 

Innovation within the EU with regards to tech (specifically digital technology), is one that the EU is lacking in, sure. But do not mistakenly believe that such is the case in every other industry, I assure you, it is not. The US is strong in digital tech innovation, but is not as strong with regards to other industries, that the EU is stronger in. It's the way of the world, and if you've ever read Global trade 101, you know that it is exactly this imbalance that creates the demand for international export/import. 

But sure, the EU could do a bit better in this, very specific field.; I agree that Europe massively lacks behind the US in terms of innovation, but what does that have to do with a civil war? The US is arguably much closer to a civil war with how divided the country is. But even there, claiming that a civil war is imminent would be ridiculous.

Also, i really don't think that the problem with the EU are regulations around stuff like misinformation or AI. The biggest problem is a general aversion to risk and a lack of venture capital, combined with pretty big regulatory hurdles to start a business - but those things apply to all sectors, not just tech.; Stay safe out there, brother.; Thinking that you aren't from EU was giving you the benefit of the doubt for your ignorance.

Tech innovation in EU is weak, yes but you don't strenghten it by giving foreign tech giants more leeway.

My advice is read less musk tweets and get a grip on reality.; [deleted]; So you just assume the military leadership will not be loyal to their country and the constitution but to trump?; Specific field ? Industry lost to china, Tech to US  
What is left? the social aspect, holidays ? 

Germany using coal and (inexistent) wind instead of Nuclear ? 

You can read companies closing at a faster rate in almost every industry in Europe, the golden age is clearly over; I like your take on it, the sentence general aversion to risk is spot on; let's see in a year if anything changed

Spoilers, no; by ethnic i meant anti-trumpers.; We are currently in a more tumultuous time period. Those come and go every few decades. If you zoom out and look at history, this period is not that remarkable compared to previous problematic times. Yet, with the current traditional and social media situation, people seem to be thinking the doomsday is near. Look around and you'll see people with exactly the same sentiment, but about another issue in the US, Japan, Korea, Australia, various European countries, and so on.

We've been through many problems before, and we'll get through them again. 

With regards to Chinese manufacturing: This alarmist shouting of yours (and many others) is exactly what happened a 50 years ago, when the Japanese manufacturing sector outshone that of their western counterparts. Yet, somehow, situations were resolved and the different nations have specialized in different fields of industry and segments of markets. China is currently undergoing such a time period, India will, soon as well. It will be disruptive, it will cause headaches, there will be uncertainties. 

I'm not saying we should ignore the issue completely. I am just saying that you are not doing yourself any favors by seemingly being this alarmed and upset about it.; I am not saying EU will become a tech innovation giant and EU does need to do a lot of work in that sector. Certainly there will be no ""civil war"", lol.

That said, you are dodging all the actual questions in this thread.

* How does it help the EU and their tech sector to give foreign tech companies more leeway and gain even more dominance on the EU market?

* Which regulations specifically do you think should/would be lifted that would boost the stock by a significant amount?

* Tarrifs will make everything more expensive, resulting in people buying less.

Also in general, going long on US tech has been very good since decades. That is not a revelation.; How about the lack of the freedom? 
This is concerning and wasn’t the case in earlier EU history. To innovate, create, manufacture anything it is an administrative pain, so much so that people prefer to leave

This aspect is not going away, the EU does everything it can to axe entrepreneurship for the masses"
234,Margin Debt,"Made a few bad calls on shit stocks including one where I took on about 2000$ in marginal debt at 13%.  

I see no future in a recovery. 

How should I go about paying it off?

I have about 200$ liquid. I’m thinking I sell my NVIDIA shares to make up for it.  

Do we see a future where NVIDIA makes 1000%+ gains again?  I think we’ve reached near the top around the 150$ price mark.

Pay off the debt and live a debt free life rather than wishful thinking.; Paying 13% intrest on margin? If so that's insane robinhood is half that and first 1000 is intrest free, maybe u can switch brokers to save money; It’s only 2k which isn’t bad in the grand scheme of things.

235,Last week's high volume stocks,"* **TSLA -** Tesla saw massive move to the up and it has now gone in over extended territory. Do not chase and wait for it to dip to support level at 271.28, 
* **BAC** \- Crossed over resistance of 44.26 and retested that level. It should keep going higher under lower interest rate environment. My immediate target (resistance) is at 47.24
* **MSFT** \- Good stock to go/stay longs. Unlike many other stocks that's hitting ATH, MSFT still hasn't flown away to hit the ATH. It's not the question IF, the question is WHEN. Immediate resistance is at 438/439.
* **UPST** \- Upstart had great earnings and the stock went up by 24% in a day after earnings. The next immediate resistance is sitting between 86-95
* **META** \- Meta is going in a range at this point. The support is sitting at 558-569 and price coming to that area will be nicely bought.
* **INTC** \- Intel had nice weekly bullish candle. There are few pivot (support) levels: 24.71, 23.56, 22.12. My immediate target is at 27.86 where it can face some resistance.
* **AAPL** \- Apple has been going in a range. We need to look for a breakout/down. A close below 213 is a breakdown whereas close above 238 in daily chart will be a breakout.
* **AMZN** \- Amazon had a breakout above 200. Will it retest or continue going higher? My target to above sits at 214 for now.
* **AMD** \- Lot of people are looking at AMD. It had a bullish last week but I believe it still has some more room below before rallying.
* **SOFI** \- Nice weekly breakout. Do not chase and wait for retest. The key level to retest is at 11/12 range.
* **NVDA** \- Three weeks ago Nvidia had weekly breakout and then it retested those levels before continuation to the upside last week.

236,When is a person too tech heavy?,"So I was always interested in investing and I recently invested 1000€ through IBKR.

I put 2/3 of that money in CSPX and 1/3 in IUIT.

I have 6000€ more to invest any I’m planning on putting some of that money in individual stocks. AAPL, MSFT and NVDA are already 50% of IUIT so I don’t think that I need more of them but I’m planning to put 5% in GOOGL and AMZN each.

GSAT and ASTS are companies that I think have the technology of the future. They’ve also got big investments by big companies and I think that Apple and Verizon know what they’re doing so I’m planning to put 5% in GSAT and ASTS each as well.

Rest will go to VUSA and maybe a smaller part in IUIT.

My question is am I too tech heavy for my age and when is person to tech heavy?

And what are some good ETF for diversification?

",https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1go01sq/when_is_a_person_too_tech_heavy/,0,2024-11-10 13:55:04,"I would say when:
1) they start using margin to be >100% tech or
2) if they own leveraged tech ETFs other than 3x or 2x Nasdaq 100 or
3) they have a large enough position where they personally cannot hold that position through a late 2000s type recession or
4) they own >40% of liquid net worth in any one stock.; When they are weighed down by all the returns they are getting.; Depends on current strategy and risk appetite. Currently I am going all in in a single growth tech stock.; When you own mid/small cap tech; If you're asking this question, then I would say NOW!; Tech is to ingrained in our lives not to have heavy exposure. Want more diversity do an S&P 500 equal weight cot mid cap fund additionally; It being ok to have 100% exposure to the tech industry is a wild take; PLTR?; What sectors are good to diversify, military and health seem good but what are the best UCITS ETFs for those sectors?; Always depends on a persons financial goals. Maybe their okay with taking significantly more risk than others.; Going to sound boring but seriously the strategy the s&p500 uses for inclusion is great. I always make sure I have a significant portion of a portfolio in that.

For individuals I do a valuation and general analysis. I’ve liked banking and PE for the past couple years and remain with a strong outlook, particularly with deregulation expectations under the new administration; great take; I’d argue diversifying beyond Nasdaq 100 is “de-worsification.”  Nasdaq 100, ticker QQQM, owns utilities, healthcare, consumer staples, industrials, etc.  However, if you want to reduce drawdowns at the cost of lower long-term returns, S&P 500 is the best choice.; According to the models I’ve run/seen, the reduction of drawdowns is exactly what provides a higher return; Try running models comparing S&P 500 to a 2x leveraged S&P 500 (eg. SSO).  Bigger drawdowns and bigger returns.  Quality risk assets will have big drawdowns and big returns, eg. 2x S&P 500, 2x Nasdaq 100, Nasdaq 100, Nvidia, Bitcoin, Tesla, etc.  I expect all to outperform this upcoming decade and underperform in any big recession.; Leverage brings higher returns on rising assets. Who knew!

Note that you do experience slippage and decay with levered ETFs; Lucky for us the S&P 500 has been a rising asset over long periods.  Historically, “slippage” and “decay” for 2x leveraged S&P 500 has actually been to the upside over long periods supporting my original point further.  I love the boost “slippage” provides on the 2x S&P 500 ETF.  That’s a feature, not a bug.; Decay is the cost of leverage. It’s not to the upside. Slippage means it doesn’t track due to turnover.

I have no doubt you can make more with leverage, that’s not outperformance"
237,Just saw a post about Motley Fool,"I signed up for their investment services in 2021. These were the stocks recommended by the service. I bought when I had an extra $1,000 to play with so I did not buy all of their picks every month.

I will say that they recommended picks like AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, AMZN, etc as well... but like duh. 

Anyways, I'll just leave this here.

[https://imgur.com/a/3uYNLCf](https://imgur.com/a/3uYNLCf)",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gnrwn1/just_saw_a_post_about_motley_fool/,368,2024-11-10 04:49:09,"I had like 3 buddies who all split a MF subscription in 2019. They mostly bought any of the “big buy” (forgot the name of their recommendation scale) recommendations except for one guy who “does his own research” and only bought when he felt the business was stable. ALL of them lost money. The “cautious” guy lost the most 😅; Those results are hilariously bad; MF is like a paid subscription to Cramer. You’re going to lose.; [deleted]; Good ole LMND. They fucked me on that one.; If you put that amount into SPY in July 2021 you would have $19,541.46 right now, or a 39% increase (over 10% annualized).; You joined a high beta growth recommendation service right at a huge peak in a bubbly market that then crashed high flyers as bad or worse than in the GFC.  Timing matters. For instance, if you bought SHOP when they recommended it in 2014 (or 2016?), you'd be up 2,500%, even after the post-pandemic tech crash. But if you bought it in mid/late 2021, you'd still be down 50%.  You joined during a period of peak irrational exuberance.

That said, I think Fool has gotten worse than a dart throw, for the most part.  I made a gazillion on SHOP over the last 10 years, and if I had bought more NVDA when they pushed it, I'd have another gazillion (I'm up 1000%, but on an initially small position).  I'm also up a gazillion on NFLX from them.  But in the last few years, they've killed me on stocks that I really should've been more wary of, like Match Group, LMND, FVRR, PINS, and more.  Which is why I took such a wimpy little position in NVDA, unfortunately - I don't really trust them any more.; >2021 

lol; The general opinion among members is that it went downhill after one of the founders retired. They’ve had some great picks from 2000-2020 like Amazon, Netflix, and Nvidia when those companies were well-known but not the monsters they are today. One or two picks like that will make up for a lot of misses.; Damn…that’s not what I expected…sorry…; The problem for their service is they tell you what to buy , but they don’t tell you when to sell. So you eventually could lose all your gains; LEMONADE!!!!! Man, those were the days....; They put the”fool” in investing. Those guys are shills.; David Gardner was great. Tom was good, too. Bill Mann was good. Unfortunately David retired some years ago and I don’t think the others work on recommendations anymore either. MF lost its magic some time ago I’m sad to say. I loved it for learning when they started, and I feel they’ve lost their way on education and instead the marketers took over.; I used to have a subscription with them and I liked reading their recommendations for ideas. I had bought TTD back in 2019/2020 I think and have done well since then. I did also buy Shopify back in 2015/2016 or so and did well with it as well. 

However, I don't have the subscription anymore. Problem with a service like this is they have to keep churning out recommendations in order to feel worth it for subscribers. If they made posts saying ""I've got no recommendations right now"" then they wouldn't get any subscribers. So I felt like they just make suggestions regardless of the price of a stock. 

Also, their recommendations were not as detailed as I'd like. Very high level with little analysis provided. 

I did like their Motley Fool Money podcast and did listen to it religiously. But have slowed down/stopped recently because the host Chris Hill left and the replacement hosts are just no where near as good. 

I'm glad I used to use it, because I felt like I learned a bit from them. But not anymore.; are they just copying the baddest of bad cathy wood picks?; They had a portfolio service called Supernova that I subscribed to for a while and did amazing. It also included a feature I loved where they published the slack conversations of the analysts who were picking for the service so you could see their rational for their picks and how they would make arguments for them to each other. 

Everything else of theirs has been shit.; All of these services and gurus don't know shit or have every motivation to give you suspect advice. Why? For their own personal gain. 

By the time you get their advice you're likely late to the party anyway.; If they really knew what they were doing, why don't they launch their own Motley Fool mutual fund or ETF that beats the market every year??; I stopped reading Motley Fool when I noticed Neil Patel, the know plagiarizer was writing for them. I immediately blocked any of their articles showing up in my feed 

I’ve made money from their tips in the past but it’s gone downhill for a good 3-5 years now; I bought VLD because of an article on this shit stain of a website. The company got delisted and I’m down -92% all of this in less than a year.; The big risk with MF etc isn't that you'll go there once, pick stocks based on what you see, hold them for years, and have those stocks underperform.

They would go broke if people used the site that way.

They want to keep you off-balance, feeling like you always need to be checking them. And if you're doing that, you're probably constantly buying and selling based on shifting notions, which is the surest way to fail in investing.

They won't tell you this is what they're doing, they'll write articles like ""10 energy stocks to buy and hold forever"". And then next week they'll tell you 10 tech stocks to buy and hold forever, etc. 

They don't care if you end up 10k or 100k poorer at retirement because of them. If they make their 10 bucks in ad revenue from you over the years, they're good.; They don't call it fool for nothing..; I tried it. Paid for a month, and when they spent the entire time trying to still get money from me, I figured it wasn’t worth it.; Lemonade is a good call now!  
  
CALLED IT BITCHES!; The thing that made me quit MF was when they recommended Go Pro [(GPRO)](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/gpro?mod=search_symbol) as a buy at $80. That is, I canceled after I got done laughing. Their rationale was even funnier than the rec itself. 

It's $1.46 today.;  I’ve never thought that paying for investment advice, but my old boss killed it on their picks. He had over $1M of Tesla at one point on a $60,000 investment.  He also crushed it on Shopify, and a couple others.  In 2020 he owned 4 of 5 best performing stocks of the year, all MF picks. 

Somewhat convinced, I asked for the latest big pick and put $40,000 into Teledoc that’s now worth about $3,000.; If you are not a savvy investor, I think you should start with an index (eg SP500) and a few blue chips (eg mag 7), to familiarize yourself with the market while keeping your risk manageable. For an index like SP500 and companies like mag 7, they do go up and down, but in the longer term (say 3y to 5y) you are still quite likely to make money rather than lose money.; MF is literally regarded; There is a reason its called Motley **FOOL**; I always laugh a bit whenever I see their advertisements saying X% returns over the sp500. Like if you were making so much money from an investments you wouldn't be trying to sell me your knowledge, yous just be investing in it yourself and collecting the payday.

Also some of those companies are crazy. Roku peaked around $450 in 2021. They make a decent enough product (been using a Roku ultra for many years now and a Roku 3 on another TV for even longer), but it seems like a very copyable device.; Reminds me decades ago when I learning about investing when there was little knowledge and information for everyone, internet was uncommon, I discovered toxic or scam information is still something to gain knowledge by figuring out the things behind, because back then that's the only sources you can get, no one on TV or news paper is educated and financial literacy; Are there any other alternative to MF?; We’re the stocks you bought even recommended by MF? Those look more like Reddit recommendations to me.; Unfortunately you just barely missed their NVDA recommendation; Articles like this prove Motley Fool is a joke of a website:

https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/09/38-percent-of-warren-buffetts-315-billion-is-in-3/; As a fellow naive investor, I offer sympathy. I used to read MF's free articles with interest, but eventually something about it started to feel off. I realized that ""investing"" really means index funds. Buying single stocks is ""gambling"". If I want to gamble, an evening at the blackjack table is cheaper, more predictable, and much more fun.; They have a knack for picking things right before they dump.  Look more at it being a short sellers report was my lesson.; I’m not MF, but get in QS asap, it’s going to explode next year.; Thank you for your sacrifice.; Thats a lot of profit pal. The irony is in their name.; I've always figured that anyone capable of actually beating the indexes, would be too busy making giant stacks of money from the market (or running a private hedge fund) to have the time to market and produce advice newsletters, websites, etc.; [removed]; Signed up for autopilot and bought most of these. No charge.; And here I am up 24% this year just by continuing to buy more of the random assortment of shares I had accrued from “freebies”.; I bought around the same time you did. Had money to invest from selling a house. Lost 100k+; Haha, I'm with you. Bought a lot of that shit too.; The timing of their recommendations is usually off. They recommend at high stock prices.  I've learned to just watch their recommendations and buy the dip.; A callback to peak euphoria.; good old boring index funds is the way!; The first rule of thumb about investing is, get over whatever fascination with Mötley fool you have as quickly as possible; Got a free one year subscription with them through CC promotion. I bought a few of their picks but ended up losing money. I did not renew when I keep seeing their articles about ""Why stock XYZ is up 50% today"", ""why stock is down 20% today."" on Yahoo Finance. 

One way for them to get you hooked into subscribing is how they keep announcing a new pick every two weeks or so. However, there are so many stocks out there, if you buy all their picks then might as well buy total market index or SP500.; Yeah, i gave up on Motley Fool.   I have toyed with Investor's Business Daily before.  I may resubscribe to them, but curious if anyone here subscribes to IBD currently and their experience?  I know it's more growth oriented while MF is more value focused.; I've never taken their articles serious.  No real data, they come off as native ads, kind of like forbes articles. Just a paid puff piece for a company.  Always terrivle advice or just obvious front running hot stocks. Never considered signing up for their service.

I always go to seeking alpha if I see a stock name pop up enough in the area I'm looking at.  I like sites with a comment section so I can see if people are destroying the author. 😂; Skillz, Pinterest and Lemonade....I bought that crap too, on the recommendation of MF

I cancelled my subscription (not in time to get a refund) and told the customer service person that if I ever subscribed again, it would be in an effort to use their recommendations as a contra-indicator.

MF is beyond awful.; Oof; Shit. there’s fool in their name for a reason. I don’t like the motley fool.; I lost money on FVRR and ROKU lol; I have their lowest tier subscription for years. Largely just do it for companies to research. I’ve lost on a couple during Covid, but man, they got me in to nvidia so I’m happy lol; It's ok i have 10 articles i like better!; Motley Fool also recommend SMCI even after it got confirmed they are manipulating their accounting book.   
It goes without saying, they are pretty bad.; It seems like it would be hard to get to that level of bad with trying, almost impossible by random picks from SPY top-end.; You're not alone! I didn't renew!; Love how they try to tell you the returns you will see. Always do your own research!; I would avoid any service that does not meticulously track **all** their picks, along with recommended buy/sell dates, and present that history to subscribers. Show your work, or all the marketing in the world is worthless.; So I had $30,000 to invest and a Motley Fool buy list showed up on my Yahoo page.  They had five stocks. Two did not do well, I got rid of them quick, one is up a bit, one is up 28% and one is up 50%.  Not bad.  With those and my picks I am up $2600 in the last three weeks.; Your suppose to push Webistics!; Please try Unrivaled Investing next and let us know if it's good; Thanks for sharing. A few times I’ve thought about subscribing but I didn’t like that all their examples were from 15+ years ago.; I tried them a few years ago and lost money. Some picks were good but mostly they were a pump and dump factory.; IDK how anyone hears of an organization called ""Motley Fool"" and thinks...""yeah, that's who I want deciding my financial future.""; MF is another pump and dump!; I read MF as Mother Fuckers as they should've been called.; A lot of bashing the Fools, but I've made money with their newslestter.  Lost money on the Roku tho.; Thats strange when the motley fool 100 is up 512% to the s&p 85% over the last 5. ?; Just imagine losing money in the stock market since 2019. Yes, it was volatile, but the market had outstanding returns in total.; It’s just like buying into a Kramer pick.

Early MF portfolios did have some meteoric picks that drove big gains - which is along the lines of a Peter Lynch-style approach hunting “ten-baggers” and such.

|-|-|-|-|; Well that’s much appreciated. Didn’t seem to come across as so critical. 

After reading that, it feels like Dish and EchoStar might be more seriously in the crosshairs, considering they are the only entity authorized in the 2GHz band. 

I think with $AAPL backing and signaling they will find $GSAT as long as goals are met, SpaceX (and possibly even $TSLA) would benefit from taking ownership of EchoStar, their IP, and band.

But I acknowledge I have a position in $GSAT and want them to succeed. And I never did like Dish ;); No but those 2027 January $3 calls for .60 not looking so bad.

240,Opinion of IG vs ETF for long-term investing? Numerical examples wanted!,"I'll try to keep this short.

I (31M) am in Canada and have a steady job with a pension, own my house, no large debts (besides mortgage and car), and have 47K in cash that I've been sitting on for far too long. I have played with stocks in the past on Questrade and have basically only come out slightly positive because of investments in Apple and AMD. I was suggested a financial advisor and started talking with one at IG Wealth Management.

Long story short: I'm getting cold feet at pulling the trigger with them. The portfolio they are suggesting is the iProfile Portfolio Global Equity Series F managed by Philip Petursson. Based on my aggressive investing stance, I'd be paying a 2.37% fee (MER of 1.01%). However this portfolio has nice returns after accounting for the fee (8.11 for 3YR, 28.01 for 1YR, 18.38 YTD).

But doing some quick maths it looks like the fees would cost me $300K over 25 years in fees (if I'm investing 10-12k a year). This does not account for a waived or decreased fee once you hit $250k, which would be around year 11 for me.

When I asked about these numbers they said that These funds are actively managed and you're paying for the available advice, as well as dampening losses in bad years, and overall a better return in the long run compared to index funds. They also said an expected growth per year is 7%.

I was also cautioned that ETFs have hidden fees that are not shown upfront...which from what I have read, is not true.

I know these advisors are salesmen that want to gain more clients. But I'm also aware that anyone can post their financial advice on reddit and act like it is the gospel while having no credentials to back it up.

So my question is: What are people's experiences with IG vs ETFs and self investing? Would people be willing to share their experiences with either ETFs or IG and give numerical examples to back up their stance?

Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gmtoc6/opinion_of_ig_vs_etf_for_longterm_investing/,5,2024-11-08 22:31:04,"Paying a 2.37% fee is like financial suicide. 


Absolutely not. 


IG is not a serious shop, either.


Also: ""and overall a better return in the long run compared to index funds."" 
Total horseshit. 


This fund has to beat the market by 2.37% every year for the next 34 years plus up to 30 years after that to your age 95.


And that is to just march the market returns you could get for 0.03% fees.


Don't be stupid.; I agree 2.37% is a lot, and is what made me pump the brakes with them. Truth is 300K ridiculous for advice, unless it's going to make me millions. But as a beginner to long term investing, I wanted to make sure that I wasn't underestimating the use of an Advisor.

So, even ignoring fees, would an ETF like VEQT or XEQT be equal or better to the returns of IGI1902 portfolio?; If you want ""market"" returns, go for vxc which is world excluding Canada. 


VEQT or xeqt would be the one-fund solution I would take.


Mer is 0.22% for those. Paying 2.1% more is just not a good idea."

Their cloud subscriptions, and the market no longer worried about defunding LEO’s (they really said that 2nd part lol) pushed it way over estimates.; I'm guessing it's to late to jump in? Lol. Nvm it's to high for me ; I bought a bunch of shares back when I was in college without giving it much thought. Got all of them for around $18 a share and I still hold every share. Today that one position dwarfs my entire investment portfolio I built using income for work. Nuts.; I was in at $200 then sold off due to life reasons. Got back in at $400 and going to continue adding until I have a $10,000 position; Same; Looking at the graph it appears there were three dips/buy points early August, early September, and beginning of November. What kind of dip you expecting? Those were all over $20 a share from ath; Exactly In your boat ; Pretty soon officers are going to stop going in first and let the drones check the situation out and ensure it’s safe; Not really, they’ve had One Draft for awhile now. I’ve owned AXON since 2021, todays rise was more than my cost basis 😤; So I'm a cop, and heavy Axon investor, but this technology is being really over-valued.  Courts really haven't accepted AI generated reports yet, which mean Axon's Draft1 across the board can only be used for reports that can't possibly generate an arrest, meaning the reports that should already be done online.  The AI also can't differentiate between two people talking, so any time you have more than the most basic of basic of reports, it's useless.  Any report Draft1 can write, I can write faster.  

There have been multiple other programs that have demonstrated better AI use in report writing, but until the courts catch up with them, they're essentially useless.  People thought body cameras would negate report writing, but it actually just made it so much worse.  AI's integration to the criminal justice system has yet to be seen.  So while I love Axon stock, AI report writing is one of their useless gimmick features, at least so far in my experience.  (Would love to be proven wrong here).; I’m only 28 so I’m def loading up as much as possible in the next year. They are innovative; Do you think at 35b there's more room for growth? Wonder how much a taser costs on average and often an officer would need to deploy one so there's reoccuring revenue. Might add some shares to Ira doesn't seem they have competitors and what if they get military contracts or with other police agencies across the globe; Nice! Do you use their products in your department? What's your total position worth? I've been on this company since all the  Ferguson MO  bullshit.; How do you continue to buy after the price increases so much? I wish I had more shares, but it just blew out of the water from my buy point.; Wow, AXON is probably more effective for you than your pension then probably, right? I mean, depending on how much you bought.; Still in the early innings I believe. Reoccurring revenue is a huge part of the thesis; Is it worth getting in now??? 600 is very high. But seems like it be a good holder to go with my Nvidia and vital farms I'm holding 

Genuine question. 

I remember this stock came up around covid and I passed. 

Kicking myself; Get back to me on that either here or private messaging. I don’t like the valuation either; Models are meaningless for businesses like this; I'm up almost $200k now on this stock!; Yep I remember reading about this stock in 2020. I also remember passing on it...; From someone who has used their products and the products they are replacing, yes. I believe it will go much much higher; The thing is this thing trades on future expectations and you actually need to see it in real life to get insight if this could become a big company. Reddit was so fucking obvious… people who use reddit should be kicking themselves if they did not get in for this 3-4x. It will still go higher.; People told me the same shit about reddit.  I'll take my 145% gains. Haha; My only defense is shrugging my shoulders. I’ve missed out on many gains by being to timid due to valuations across the market.; Keep sitting on the sidelines pal; I expect a pullback next ER; Sure does. Took my $$ out of Axon at age 24 when I became a addict; I sold at 80 for a pretty good profit.... I'll never sell this stock again; Today’s rise was 7x my basis lol.; Any thoughts on the drone? Any departments out there looking to integrate them into vehicles yet?; Still absolutely dominating and isolating the BWV and storage marker though. Shit, uniformed are axon mounts specific and we are 100% dependant on axon servers. 

They will keep going up untill there's a serious data breach and that's that.; A similar evolution in report writing has taken place in the Healthcare field, particularly in radiology. The technology saves time and increases radiologists' productivity by using AI to supplement the workflow by pre-screening images and, drafting a report to be reviewed, edited and finalized by the radiologist. I don't think this technology is ready to replace the humans yet, but it has taken down the time to read and report on a chest xray from something like 15 mins to 3 mins, last time I saw stats. I can see it doing the same for law enforcement and other security applications. The cloud storage, video archiving and subscription model alone explains the recurring earnings beats. I also love AXON, bought it after the police-involved shooting incident in Memphis 10 years ago.; I'm retired and you're correct. There will be some AI features that are useful but pretty much just for auto population. I don't see the auto written reports ever being useful, probably spend more time just trying to fix errors. Also I think they'll have a battle with police unions. I spent enough time in contact negotiations to see that there will have to be a lot of internal policy in place too. There will be some admin out there who will use it just like cams to search for petty discipline.
That being said, even just populating documents can save tons of time in busy areas and the protect they are selling is efficiency.
I'm heavy into Axon too. They are building an entire public safety ecosystem and they are doing it well.; Absolutely.  Tasers just use carriages to shoot so you don’t need a new one every time they’re used, and most departments will get the newest tasers for “free” as part of their safety plan/subscription to the eco system.  

They keep releasing more and more law enforcement based products which will become necessary for departments to adopt, and there’s competitors but they’re not on the same level.  They’re also getting into the private sector and basically exponentially increasing their total addressable market by looking beyond law enforcement.  We’ll see if that takes off, I believe it will.; Currently I think it's a good play even if there is almost no actual growth. The global police and security areas are hooked on axon servers like it's meth. EU is solely dependant on axon, there is no local storage anymore. 

Body worn videos, suspect interviews, victim interviews, CCTV and phone videos are ALL recorded on axon devices, stored on axon servers and sent to court using axon share.; Our department has their tasers and body cameras but that’s it.  However, pretty much every department will slowly start adopting more and more of their services because they’re simply the best and integrate well together.  Saying they’re the Apple ecosystem of law enforcement is accurate.  Once you have an iPhone, it makes sense to get other Apple products.  Axon is the same way.  Total position is around half a mil after today.; The company today is different from the company when I was buying in the $20s.  I basically bought them in the 20s with the hope they’d become the company they are today.  I’m buying today with the hope they’ll become the company I think they will in another 10ish years.  Seeing the average share price go up hurts a little, but I still believe in the company moving forward so I’ll continue to buy.  Have to switch my mindset a little so it doesn’t hurt as much haha; Same here. People in this sub were talking about it after George Floyd. It was *only* around $80 back then. I'm kicking myself too; It will be a week or two before I model it, but fair play to you for getting in early enough, you took the risk and earned the reward. With the new administration, do you think they’re going to get a lot of favouritism and bumper contracts?; How so?; Thank you, hope so!; I can hope and pray; Their drones are way more expensive than their competitors (DJI has that market covered, but they’re China based so have security concerns) and don’t offer too much of an increase in production and connectivity.  Their drone offerings seem to exist just so they can say they have them.  However, reading the founder/CEOs book, drones are a huge part of his vision for the future, but even talking about arming drones with even Tasers resulted in basically the whole ethics board of the company resigning.  

Axon has the best in car cameras and their vision of the future of having drones follow around vehicles and respond to calls first is amazing, and with “live crime” centers becoming a thing across the country, I think Axon will be a major player in that market.  They kinda need to get out of their own way in that regard though.  To compare it to Tesla, they’re selling the model S but everyone wants/needs the model 3, and they don’t really offer that in drone tech quite yet.; Thank you, I did not realize they use subscription based model that's incredibly powerful, I wonder if they're working with out countries yet and their police agencies which seems could be next step reaching global market?; It definitely won’t hurt them, that’s all I have to say on that topic. I also wouldn’t call it a huge victory, I had to sell my shares under $200 and missed an even lower cost basis. $400 with only a 4K position isn’t great. Hoping to build up to $10,000 though, just not sure if I should wait for a pullback. Holding for 20 years though so probably doesn’t matter; any luck?; I'm going to agree with the other guy. There is still so much for them to build out in the US. They are building an entire ecosystem that works smoothly together, which is something that the government is very bad at. I believe there are still years of climbing to go."
243,A Look at History: A Review of the 7 Bull Markets in U.S. Stocks Over the Past 50 Years,"Looking back at the history of U.S. stocks, all the bull and bear markets after the Great Depression, it is worthwhile for us to go like a history textbook to learn a little.
To rise 20% as the standard, the past 50 years a total of seven bull market, with the A shares of the bear long bull short different, U.S. stock history is a bull long bear short history, the following we review one by one.


1. 1970-1973:
Starting from the famous “Nifty Fifty”, the “ Pretty 50 ‘, the popular investment theme at that time was what we later knew as the ’Pretty 50”, which included a series of high-profile companies such as McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, Polaroid, etc. At that time, these stocks were characterized by high earnings growth and high PEs. These companies included McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, Polaroid, and a series of other high-profile companies, and at that time, these stocks were characterized by high performance growth, and at the same time, the PE was also very high. From a paper found online that specializes in the study of that time, we see that in 1972 Polaroid PE was 91 times, McDonald's was 86 times, and Coca-Cola was 48 times. Eventually, the bubble burst in 1973, when the PE of the S&P 500 was 18x

2. 1974-1980:
During that period in the 70's and 80's, inflation was stronger and interest rate levels went all the way up. in 1980, inflation was as high as 13.5% and interest rates were raised to 20%, a figure that might be unimaginable today. In the midst of all this raising of interest rates along the way, this last leg of the bull market came to an end when the PE of the S&P 500 was only 7.5

3. 1982-1987:
Another new cycle began, inflation was curbed, interest rates began a long downward spiral that continues to this day, and with various tax cuts, a new bull market was up. The five-year bull market lasted until Black Monday in 1987, when the broad market fell 22% in one day. In fact, the PE of the broad market at that time was not too high, 15 times PE. This crash was rather sudden, and there are also claims that the computerized trading model introduced at that time led to this rapid plunge. However, since then, the meltdown mechanism has been invented

4. 1987-1990:
The selloff brought on by Black Monday was quickly followed by a rally, a rallying bull of sorts as the broader market accumulated a 65% gain by 1990. By 1990, interest rates once again stayed high because of the rising oil prices at the time, and the 10% interest rate level was never seen again for 30 years after that. At that time, the broad market PE was 15 times, which was not too high, and the index decline lasted only three months before it was over

5. 1990-2000：
The 90's were good and beautiful, and the 10-year-long bull market was about to kick off. This decade the U.S. economy is good, Windows95, Windows98, Yahoo, the Internet has brought unlimited imagination, the feeling is not immediately into the new century, but into the new world. Ten years, the general market rose more than 4 times, are epic. Eventually the internet bubble bubbled, Amazon went from a high of 100 bucks, down to a few bucks, while the S&P 500 lost 50% of its value

6. 2002-2007:
The low interest rate level and zero down payment to buy a house, if you are interested, you can go and watch the movie “The Big Short” again, which describes it in a very easy-to-understand way. You can buy a house with no money, and when you do, home prices go up, and you feel happier to spend money when you have money, and the guys get high. Wall Street has repackaged these subprime zero-down mortgages into a product that is complicated for everyone to understand, but looks like an oxymoron, so how can you not make money? The farce had to end, and it did, with the 2008 subprime crisis, which left 8 million people unemployed, 6 million homeless, and the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression in the U.S. Between 2007 and 2009, the S&P 500 lost nearly 60% of its value, Citibank lost 97% of its market capitalization, and Lehman Brothers went bankrupt.

7. 2009-Present:
After the subprime mortgage crisis cleared up, U.S. stocks had one of the longest bull markets in history. It was also an era when large U.S. technology companies became stock market leaders. more than a decade after the release of the iPhone in 2007, Apple became the world's largest company by market capitalization. Microsoft, which had almost been forgotten, returned to the top of its market capitalization after transforming itself into cloud computing. And then there's Amazon, left over from the last Internet bubble, and Google, the Google created during the last Internet bubble, have grown to become giants with market capitalizations of over $2 trillion dollars

[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse); Well, if you're going to ignore what happened between February-March 2020 and January-October 2022, then according to you, we'll always remain in a bull market.; So according to this routine, what is your hypothesis and conclusion?; The Nasdaq went from 16k to 10k from 21-22. I would say that was a crash. The run now has been going on from 23-current. We will have a few more years; What happens when workers invest 10% into index funds via a 401K.; Ah yes. Ignoring 2020-2022 ffs. 
Its not 2009-present. Rather 2009-2021
Then 2022-present; Was this written by a recent immigrant? It's gibberish; Great write up. Archetypal forecasts are showing we're in a great new bull market that will last up until 2031.; Lol the dude basically picked and chose what to include and what not to include.; This post is reviewing just the bull market periods, not the bear market, so it made sense to me lol; 🚀🚀🚀; It’s such an unpredictable situation 
After all,it’s impossible for everyone to use 10% of their 401k at the same time to invest at the same time 
lol; Archetypes don't even apply to people, they certainly don't apply to markets; Same bro; Waiting from to hear from OP to see what he thinks about the next 2/4 and including the end of this year; I agree in a short run that I was looking for OP answer as well with all this research; Yeah after all , the market is different every day 
but it can be used as a reference; We’re in a bull market; OK, thank you"
244,Tesla hits $1T Market Cap for the first time since 2021,"The recent rally this week has pushed it over $1T again.  


1Mo: +28%  
3Mo: +59%  
YTD: +24%  

There are now nine $1T Market Cap companies: Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Saudi Aramco, Meta, TSMC, Tesla.

That’s why Tesla stock is skyrocketing; It can’t keep going up can it? Just sold today and took gains; I sold at $260 😭; Only a month ago TSLA was down over 10% YoY while the market was up over 30%.  Crazy how fast this stock has moved I'd expect a post euphoria pullback at some point.; [deleted]; Clown stock, clown market, clown world.; If this continues I will enter a short position; Reddit is proven once again to be completely out of touch with the market.  So glad I DCA in the past two years.; As a perma bear on Tesla its the first Time i bought in to the stock because corruption and delusion are powerful instruments. But im going to sell in a short amount of time.; Memes are very valuable. Probably more so than cash flow in this economy; So much for the idea that Musk being political is hurting Tesla; Back to nonsensical numbers again, where Tesla occupies the entire car market based on future stock projected growth.

Robotaxis won’t work, even if they bypass regulatory hurdles…; Open corruption and favoritism, I'm sure this will end well.; I just sold at $321. I'm not gonna worry about what coulda been. Enjoy your gains, kids!; I was told on reddit that Elon will run it into the ground.; Can someone please explain this to me? I get that Musk's other businesses (particularly SpaceX) are likely to feast on government contracts but am I wrong in thinking Tesla is in a sticky spot right now? The average Tesla buyer is a middle to upper-middle class person who believes in climate change... you know, a Democrat! For the last year I've seen Teslas in my city with bumper stickers saying ""I bought it before he went crazy!"". Musk has so unabashedly embraced MAGA... so crassly and emphatically raised a middle finger to the lefter side of the American political spectrum...I have to think 60-70% of his customer base will never buy another car from him at this point and very possibly you may see a flooding of the used market. I cant imagine Joe the Plumber is going to now go out and buy 'one of those little pansy EVs' now... What am I missing? Why is Tesla (specifically Tesla and not Musk's other businesses which I know are not public) surging.; I literally called this,  it didn’t actually think it would happen.. so annoying 😂

I started DCA out of this shit anytime it was above $215 like over a year ago when Musk started ditching the $25k model 2 and went balls deep I. FSD.

Company is basically doing the exact same thing as then, has a slightly better energy department.. yet the stock is $100 higher.. 

If I was a full on bear I’d probably shoot myself; Elon said: “to hell with begging for energy credits and subsidies from the government. I am going to become the government now! I will change subsidies to $20k for cars made by American manufacturers whose name starts with a T. Everyone else gets a zero.”
Result: Tesla sales and revenue through the roof at the cost of taxpayers money. Stock to $5T!!; Bets on crony capitalism!!; Can’t wait for this bubble to pop in the next presidency. But I’m riding this shit hard in the meantime.; Pretty cool I’m currently up 1795% from my April 2019 buy I’m still holding; I went long TSLA 300 shares once I learned about their neural net approach for real-world AI. (Robotics, self driving)

They have such a data and manufacturing advantage that I'm incredibly bullish. I'm up 35% and just invested this year.

It's also worth noting that I always make the most money when I bet against the sentiment of the overly emotional idiots in subs like this.; The leftist eco chamber that is Reddit, can't take any more Tesla winnings, they are going to have a mental breakdown at this point; Wall Street cucking to Musk; The new unicorn unicorn; Wow I want to kick myself for not buying calls but this but this isn’t even fundamental; I'm just here to hear the ultra smart tesla bears tell us that Telsa is finished.......despite being wrong 100 out of 100 times so far.; Fortune favors the Bold


Elon always swings for fences of course it always helps if your bat is corked.; Elon hater gonna hate; It’s a meme stock, but many have lost their shirt waiting for a meme stock to fall.; It’s gonna crash soon. Good for those who are riding the gravy train for now.; There's going to be even less people who want to buy Tesla's now. For me, I will never, in a million years, buy one.; Ridiculously overvalued. It's a clown market with the momentum factor outperforming every other factor by a wide mile this year. Folks are buying what's going up simply because it's going up, valuations be damned.; I cant help but wonder, does Gates still have a short position on this?; How on earth can Tesla be so much more worth than any other car company I really don’t get it.; Imagine shorting Tesla lmao.
Thanks for saving my portfolio daddy Elon; Tesla is going to be in awkward place once trump’s China tariffs start. China is going to retaliate against Tesla; Elon bought America, like it or not, Tesla will be the most valuable company in the world, and Elon will be the world’s first Trillionaire.  None of it will make sense.; Wow; The only time the grift has some validity for its run up. The ceo is literally an extension of the presidents cabinet at this point. Makes sense that he will benefit; It’s gonna keep running up under Trump but I can’t invest in companies without sound financials. I see this doubling in next 4 years on Trump euphoria alone.; Too much trust on Elon and Trump bromance; weird how a bunch of climate-change deniers who goes around mocking Californians driving around Teslas are now all aboard with the Tesla hype train... Maybe the silver lining in all of this is that EVs adoption will accelerate, and we'd stop burning as much fossil fuel? It'd be ironic if that is what's going to happen.; Imagine what a good time for hi m to now join government but sell shares at these prices because he “has to divest” him holdings as an excuse to cash out; Chronicles of Market Madness

Took 6,000 points on the S&P 500. It was understood that it would try, but it was tried in just 4 days of growth on very high trading volumes - 1.5 times higher than usual. 

Usually high turnovers occur during quarterly expiration conditions (September and March this year) or during a major collapse (August 5-6, 2024), but even more rarely ... when a local high is forming. 

The last time there was comparable volume on an isthay breakout was in December 2021 when a high was formed, then the market fell about 25% for a year. 

The market rose 5.55% from Monday’s low to Friday’s high. The last time it happened was on 27.12.2021 (5.75%) at the moment of maximum formation. Another indicative breakout was 03.24.2000 (7.21%) and then the market formed the peak of the dotcom bubble, the high was updated only at the end of 2007 and consolidated 6 years later (more than 13 years of recovery attempts).

During the week 3 trillion of capitalization or +5.2% of market growth was created by 614 companies with 48.3 trillion of total capitalization. 

●The top 100 companies contributed 2.2 trillion in gains with a combined capitalization of 34.8 trillion.

●The top 50 companies contributed 1.87 trillion in incremental capitalization to the entire market with a total capitalization of 28.8 trillion. 

The top 5 companies contributed 837 bln: Nvidia - 317 bln, Tesla - 222 bln, Google - 101 bln, Microsoft - 100 bln, Amazon - 96.5 bln.

Over 1,000 companies (a quarter of all US public companies) showed a combined decline of 252bn, with a capitalization of 7.7 trillion, or about 12.5% of the entire market by capitalization. The leaders of the decline by scale were: Johnson & Johnson - 12.3 bln, Philip Morris and Pfizer - 10 bln, AbbVie - 8.6 bln.

The major contributors to the market growth pattern were:

- Technology: 1.37 trillion or +6.4%, contributing 46% of the total market growth or 2.4 p.p. to the overall growth of 5.2%

- Finance: 438bn or +6.2%, contributing 14.7% or 0.76pc.

- Business & Industry: 363 bln or +5.5%, contributing 0.63 p.p.

- Consumer Staples: 326 bln or +5.7%, contributing 0.56 p.p., but Tesla alone contributed 222 bln, and non-durable consumer goods were down 0.3% or minus 8 bln.

- Commerce: 234bn or +4.4% contribution was 0.41pc, where Amazon contributed almost 100bn. 

- Healthcare: 122bn or +2%, contribution was 0.21p, biotech and pharma were mostly down.

- Commodities & Utilities: 69bn or +1.9%, 0.12pc contribution, where utilities declined and growth was generated by oil & gas and metals.

- Transportation & Communications: 55 bln or +3.3%, 0.09 p.p. contribution.

The breakout of the isthmus with record momentum at very high rates and the market rising broadly is a reversal pattern, just as it was in the bubble of 2021, 2000 and 1929.; Yet it makes about 3 dollars a share. Worse is they sold few and made less money this year than last. Cyber truck appears to be a dud selling  6 years of reservations in 6 months but not getting much traction after that. 

This is a company valued on growth alone and that has completely stalled. More so, his tie to a very right leaning person is very much leaving a bad taste in the mouths of center to left leaning people. The segment that was most likely to buy a Tesla. 

It is becoming a meme stock.; Paving the way for a new ATH in time.; TSLA is now un-investable.; Time to short; All maga people will buy Tesla now; The stock will reach 400 USD soon and then who knows…; I like the stock; Is it to late now to buy Tesla stocks ?; Quick reminder that Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Saudi Aramco, Meta & TSMC both make significant profits and have grown at an impressive rate.

Still waiting for Tesla to deliver something other than empty promises.; Currently at 977 billion on google...; EZest scalp of a lifetime. Hop on apes. Grab some crypto that his simps are buzzing around....; As someone smarter pointed: if elon is given a government position he will have to sell his holding first. The thing is that there is a specific clause for this situation that state that the holder of the shares who is going to work for the government doesnt have to pay tax on his gains. So basically its the best way out for musk to cash out on tesla without having to pay any taxes at all amd before his grift crash down.

But then now money can be paid to these guys directly from qatar and other autocratic sources (gulf states are known to be used by russian and chinese to circumvent sanctions and pay off their bills towards their illicit operations.); It's a p/e 90 company operating in a sector that's deader than dead. Car companies can't get rid of their EVs.; TSLA is back to were is was , 3 years ago :D

LOL !!; Always inverse Reddit; First it was Zuckerberg, then it was u/spez and now it's Musk.

The inverse Reddit emotional consensus investing strategy always works. When everyone hates some CEO that makes the stock go way down, that's the buying opportunity.

Get in while you still can.; Tesla goes sideways for a long time and then goes through fundamental re-valuations.

People are seeing that FSD is going to work and Tesla is the only company that can manage the whole stack: manufacturing vehicles, computer + cameras, massive training cluster and algorithms. 

We're going to $1k per stock as soon as the FSD demo launches. Choo choo.; Aramco? Since when are they listed?; Sold calls against shares, exp. today. Biting my fingernails off now, hoping stock cools off a bit into close.; This stock is gonna continue soaring. No point fighting it. Just buy; Anyone of us could have bought at 6:45am and held all day for massive day trade gains; Tesla shareholders bath in all the liberal tears. So salty.; just look at the comments on this post

Almost every person entering Trump's orbit ends up getting burned once they outlive their usefulness. And now what usefulness does Elon have to Trump?; he would be nothing without government handouts; Its literally quid pro quo with our tax dollars; That's fracking crazy; Don’t they have oath of non competition non taking advantage of their position to favour their own businesses.. /s after his stunt i would have thought half of the US would boycott his stuff.(the half who has money to buy a Tesla etc..); If Elon gets a government position, doesn't has to divest most of his other investments, what would prevent him from using all the money for his own space projects?; Doesn't have anything to do with Elon's involvement in the next administration, but with the fact that all the lawfare against him will be lifted with the dismissal of the current administration.; I realized my gains today also, 700% since early 2020. I did good and not going to worry about what could have been. I will re-purchase if the stock crashes and hold again; Why not? Tesla is an official company of the US Government now.

Surely this year it'll work out.; Try it; I highly doubt that you will actually do this.

It could easily be that Trump does a lot more things to help Tesla.

Or it could be that Trump is done with Musk and throws him to the curb.

With Trump you have no idea which will happen but there is way too much of a chance he will help TSLA to short, IMHO.; This is exactly what happened last time. And shorts got burned badly for a while.

But last time Tesla was actually growing, this pumps are based on nothing but hypotheticals and maybes from our perspective. 

With that said, if trump actually does what some people are thinking. Betting against Tesla in the future may be like betting against SP500..; Don't bother unless it's on short term trades for now.


The games from 2020 and to an extent 2021 are back (should even include late 2019 to an extent probably as well).


The only thing that will prevent this stock from seeing a new all time high is the Nasdaq not holding up well next year, but there's a case to be made that we don't get the bear market next year and all the reruns from 2020 run like crazy before something ugly occurs.; Momentum stocks can get more overbought than anyone thinks.

Always inverse these idiots here.

When I started investing in Tesla 5 years ago I slowly came to realise how much a subject could be manipulated on Reddit.
So many lies. Trump winning in 2016 was the first wake up call for me that I wasn't getting real info.
It's been an impossible battle. I feel sorry for all those that continue to believe what they read. Step outside these pages, go and listen to FIRST HAND information on Tesla plans and execution.; Reddit is so left wing, that the majority shoots themselves in the foot for it.

>Back to nonsensical numbers again, where Tesla occupies the entire car market based on future stock projected growth.

>Robotaxis won’t work, even if they bypass regulatory hurdles…

!RemindMe 2 years; LOL, thanks for your sacrifice; Musk's reputation didn't happen overnight. The ""pedo guy"" tweet was eight years ago. The year Musk was calling people pedophiles on twitter Tesla sold about 250,000 vehicles. Last year they sold about 1.8 million.

Betting on ""2025 will definitely be the year"" is a fine guess, but I dunno what you expect from an anonymous online forum. Good luck if you're thinking of buying puts or whatever.; The Tesla Model y is approaching the second year of being the most popular car in the world. 
The efficiencies of the way the factories are run and the 75% American supply chain will shield them from tariff issues. 
They have multiple new innovative products on the way.
Their energy division is at 30% margins with a new factory about to be finished. 
The stories about Elon and who likes him and who doesn't are manufactured and amplified on reddit. Go and read some first hand information about the company. Off this site.; The way i think of it is tsla value has never been selling cars (obviously) its a portion of the market cap but really its the bet on autonomous vehicles. For years regulators have come after tesla fsd but now Musk essentially has a “fuck regulators” phone number he can call anytime he wants. So honestly this is the best chance we now have to see a robotaxi in 2026. Same applies to spacex; I would suggest you did exactly the right thing. 

Hindsight is lovely but betting on Tesla at those valuations was borderline gambling. Just because it landed on red 3 times doesn't make the decision wrong to call it quits.; Sus; Next presidency will be when Tesla is full blown AI valuation with robotaxis deployed everywhere. That's an assured multi trillion dollar valuation. They do have some of the biggest AI data centers on the planet already. Robots will be in play in 4 years or so and that's what can take them to $5 trillion.; I keep not buying because I keep thinking I'm too late to the party. Sigh.; Yeah Tsla is the ultimate buy and hold for this decade.; I’m up 22% on TSLA in the last few weeks; Imagine bragging about a 35% gain on a speculative investment this year; The stock should’ve done nothing but fall this year. You can go through my posts and comments, still a longterm bull. Not just some hater.

But you got lucky my guy, no major changes to the company in over a year. Stock should be below $200 rn based on past results, and it was technically overpriced then.; > I'm up 35% and just invested this year.

TSLA's up 27% this year, so something doesn't compute.; Testify!; You are insane, tesla is a shit company for the valuation and you dont know shit about AI or robotics else you woulnt write this, this company is just one big scam. But Elon is now in the white house and can do whatever he likes so its rises nothing to do about the company itself; my guy, this has been the TSLA rhetoric. Promise crazy shit that is 1-3 years away, never deliver, promise other shit, keep selling cars, get valuated as a AI tech robot company, keep selling cars.; But but but the taxis???  LMAO; Could you expand? I mean Tesla has a plant in China, and their American cars are the most American made vehicles out of any car, so they won’t need to out source much; This is a benefit to Musk getting Trump in his pocket. He'll have influence on these ""tariffs"" maybe make Tesla an exception lol; lol they why did he say they’re going to crash the economy; Then short it.; That's not true, he could be allowed to put his holdings in a ""blind trust"" etc. There are ways around this. I'm sure he's already thought it through and this is not news to him; Bull; Other car companies. Add up every other OEMs ev deliveries and Tesla sells double that. 
Its valuation comes from future projects that can't be modelled because they're too innovative.; It's going to be beautiful... and you know what? What will be the most beautiful... is watching Elon and Tesla, the ones the Democrats attacked, finally killing the gas car

Proud to be a TSLA investor.; Detroit proved that Government Bailouts is a viable strategy for automakers.; What are we looking at? People being wrong?; Owning X? Hannity, Tucker and others were never ""burned"" for similar reasons.; Elon bankrolled his campaign. Elon owns Twitter. Elon is the richest man alive. I don’t forsee Elon outliving his usefulness to Trump anytime soon.; Elon is probably wealthier than all of those other previous people combined. Wealth is power, I'm not so sure that it's as clear cut as Elon being in Trump's orbit as they'll orbit each other in some ways. They both have ways of making each other's lives more difficult (slightly, because their both in the class of being mostly untouchable in the grand scheme of things), and they're both incredibly petty and pigheaded so from a very dissociative perspective, this will be interesting to watch.; 700% is just overwhelmingly impressive, kudos man. but why not hold probably a minority such as 1/5 to see what happens next. For now I dont expect Tesla to crash a lot in the next four years; You are right, but eventually the valuation matters still right?; I thought Trump was anti EVs though. This would go against everything he's said. Which... I guess shouldn't surprise anyone.; Cars end up to heavy for that; I had sold a 275...

My god.; yeah corruption has always been a thing, but this is new levels for the USA.  . . Musk who is CEO of how many companies will also be in charge of a federal department while still being CEO of all those companies? The self dealing is going to be disgusting.; [deleted]; > More like the president that weaponized the government against Musk's companies is finally gone.

I think you are confused

Under Trump's first term:

- Federal EV credits expired, impacting Tesla's margins

- Trump's SEC fined Elon and Tesla $20M each, and removed him as Chairman of the Company (for the 'funding secured' tweet fraud).

under Biden:

- federal EV credits were restored, helping Tesla weather the economic headwinds of the 2020 fallout

- no other Federal action was taken against any Musk company

>  He was bullied in school and learned the hard way the only way to deal with bullies is to fight back.

Also false -- his father didn't jump to his defense because the actual fact was that Elon was the bully - teasing a classmate whose father had recently committed suicide, and his classmates didn't care for his bullying.  I.e. fuck around find out.; Peanut was the last straw. God has decided to end us all.; LOL. These are the comments I'm here for. Reddit in shambles!; Why? That’s just jealousy. Just need to worry about yourself not what others are doing; Imagine getting upset over a random stock gaining. How do you deal with actual problems?; Can you buy a LEAP put?

I don't know that much about options, but I'd think a long dated put wouldn't be destroyed if you think there's no way it can maintain this valuation for more than 9 months; If there’s one company I’ve seen you should never short, it’s Tesla; Who’s bringing the popcorn when this ends badly for trying to short it?; Make sure to use margin.; Secretary of transportation Elon lmao; [deleted]; Or the best system if you just inverse reddit; [removed]; Trump won; The direction of the stock hasn't matched the direction of the company the last few years. It was coiled up and ready to run.; Who cares about market analysis. The only thing that matters is the market. And your out of touch with it; It worked because TSLA is a great company with strong leadership.  The propaganda on here rotted peoples brains.; I've made more money doing this shit than research.; if youre into EVs long term tesla is the stock to have, thats purely logical.; Thats what I have done! I am up 18% this year, which is still less than sp500.; Most true comment on reddit. I too remember when they said that after the great firing twitter will shut down in a week because they dont have the engineers to run it anymore. LMAO.; X still makes no revenue because what big-name advertiser would want to be associated with Elon who is pushing racist conspiracy theories daily? Of course Elon is okay with losing money because he gets to spread misinformation on a platform where he has control of the algorithm. Not that it really matters when he’s made $50 billion in three days since Trump got elected; To be frank advertisers have fled and the overall product has become a mess with bots and porn running rampant no verification process. It's been shit.; It's a bigger echo chamber than even twitter was before Elon bought it. It seems these days reddit is solely comprised of refugees from twitter and tumblr. People divorced from reality.; The people here are truly idiots.  This is the worst platform on the internet.; Bro once again turned out to be the Kwisatz Haderach of South Africa and people in here still be like ""But eets just a cahr companieeeeee"".; It’s gonna hurt when Trump get angry at Musk and kick him out; Tesla will probably blow past $2 trillion in a year or 2.

!remindme in 2 years.; Regular taxi’s do last mile personal transportation.

*(Side note, logistics focused companies are less prone to complete idiocy; and they are looking into automation on major freeways/transport networks between hubs, and last mile will still be executed by people… I wonder why.)*

All self driven cars are shown in car park test courses and freeways and have shown no effort in addressing the complexities of winding roads with variable maintained infrastructure (obscured road signs, missing road markings, leaves… etc) or, variable road conditions, intense rain, snow, ice etc. Uber drivers can attach chains etc to provide a service in difficult conditions, how’s Mr AI going to do that? 

A taxi driver can also navigate when GPS signal / cell service is out.

This isn’t a regulatory hurdle, it’s a 0 to 1 engineering problem gone completely unaddressed.

Unless of course they plan to enter the non-existent (or minuscule value) market of long distance taxis (buses/trains/planes exist btw…) that need to drop you off to a real taxi to perform last mile transportation
- adding value by increasing inconvenience and cost… uhhh 😬 🤔… that will sell billions!; Feel free to remind me every year for the next 10 years… 😘

Id almost be tempted to wager, if there were any point.; so many losers on this site have already made up their mind about the ceo/company w/o looking at the facts. Dont even try to help them make money.; Tesla will be a $3T market cap based on EV sales and energy storage alone. Now you can buy and hold with conviction. If robotaxis or bots happen, then probably $10T.; I'm pretty happy considering the SPY has moved under 10% in the same amount of time. (I invested in late July)

  
Calling this bragging would be an overstatement.; In the history of investment, stocks have never been valued based on past results.

Stock prices are a reflection of what the market thinks a company looks like in the future.

Right now Tesla has no debt, years ahead of any other EV manufactor in the West, already built brand new plants with the most modern technology, and America just elected a house, senate and president that will work in the best interest of Elon Musk and Tesla.

There are good reasons as to why the market is bullish on Tesla, whether they can accomplish results in the future is of course an unknown, but thats literally what every stock investing is like. Some companies fail to meet expectations = shares fall, some companies suceed to meet expectations = shares rises.; \>stock should be below $200 based on past results

Good thing I value stocks based on expected future performance and not past performance. This kind of thinking is what caused people to miss the boat on Apple and Nvidia. Don't pay too much credence to P/E.; Well I invested starting around July. I didn't hold any in January.; That’s what people said when it was at 100bil then at 200, 300, 400bil (but really for sure now)… 700.. IT WILL CRASH ANY TIME NOW GUYS. 
Who the fuck cares. It makes us big money. This is a stock subreddit, not your political Wordpress blog.; RemindMe! 10 Years Come back to laugh at this person; Stop crying because you missed the Tesla rally; Damn now Tesla as a whole is a scam. Deranged.; I'm aware of the history and didn't touch it until I read about them switching to a neural net approach in 2023. Now I actually strongly believe they will achieve these goals.; When he says “Crash the Economy”, he means Crush the competition.  Tesla will go unscathed, and will probably be there to buy up the competition, which the Elon SEC will allow to happen.; TSLA isn't an electric car company, it's a self-driving car company that happens to make electric cars. 

To be frank, it's positioned extremely well to rake in money by turning their cars into a subscription model, and positioned extremely well by having the next admin approve his self-driving software to be the first allowed on the road. The only problem is their QC is off and they make cars glitchier than a Bethesda game.; Bailout who though, Detroit still sucks though ; You mean the competing social media site that Trump has no financial interest in?

And Hannity/Tucker never asked for the things that Elon will be. He also has a couple billion to repay the oil industry.; Yeah, maybe it's a little bit of wishcasting, but then I remember that Putin is ten times the autocrat Trump could ever be, and he still had his former right hand man leading a convoy of troops towards Moscow this year. Tom Cruise tried to assassinate Hitler.

Gonna be a helluva 4 years of chaos. I'm surprised the markets don't see that.; My goal when buying these Tesla shares was to eventually be able to buy a Tesla/other car as a downpayment or fund the entire car with my profit. My goal was reached after the pump when Trump was announced! I need a car in the next month and I wanted to secure this profit in case it crashes for whatever reason on Monday, next week, next month, etc when I planned on using this profit for a specific purpose. 

But In hindsight, I agree. I should have kept a few! I can always buy back if it dips is my mindset right now; If you hit your sale price, sell. You think it will double at this point?; first time?; In 4 years; I dont know if you've been following but valuation hasn't really mattered for the last several years; He has 100 million reasons to change his mind; He’s never been against EVs, he’s just against subsidizing them afaik.; >  thought Trump was anti EVs though.

No hes not. Why did you think that?; It would be drastically more confusing if Trump started saying things and then those things in the future ended up being consistent with his later actions. 

If he says ""I hate chocolate ice cream"" the only future scenario that would make sense to me, which wouldn't be confusing, is if we saw buckets and buckets of chocolate ice cream in his freezer and his face covered in melted chocolate.; Drain the swamp to refill it with sychophants; That's funny.; Well at least Herschel Walker will be in charge of the US missile defense shield 

https://newschannel9.com/amp/news/local/trump-says-hell-task-herschel-walker-with-missile-defense-shield-if-elected-presidential-election-white-house-politics-iron-dome-military-armed-forces; You already saw what happens when Betsy DeVos was head of the department of education.; I predict RFK will make note of all the corruption and then a year later he'll reveal it all to the media. The president will get impeached. Elon will go to jail. RFK will be glorified by the democrats. 

I tell ya, Trump is an idiot keeping RFK around. Yes, RFK is a bit wacko if you ask me, but he does seem to care about right and wrong. 100% he'll be the whistleblower.; Genuine question. What does one have to believe to think RFK in charge of the FDA is a bad thing? Aside from the negative impact on corrupt rich people at big pharma, I can't think of any reason anyone wouldn't want to see this?; Is that what’s going to happen? Or will he have to relinquish ownership if hes in a cabinet spot?; Elon can now push for regulation that only benefits TESLA, like requiring all gas stations with Tesla chargers or have 2025 car specs that is already optimize for tesla cars or get rid of regulations around labor laws.; Immediate snark without providing anything of substance. Classic redditor.; Again… corruption has a meaning. What corruption has happened?; It'll benefit even if the Trump government does literally nothing since the current administration is literally weaponizing government institutions against him.; Let’s take a few concrete examples.

Biden promoted clean energy. Solar companies benefited, initially, from his position. They endorsed him, and promoted him to voters. Is that corruption?

Now, Biden ended up betraying much of the solar industry in the U.S. by choking off their main source of solar modules… raising tariffs by 4x to over 100%. I see Biden as someone that went back on his promises of taking urgent action against climate change.

He also promoted the UAW. the UAW endorsed him, promoted his candidacy, and helped elect him. He appointed people to the NRLB that are pro-UAW. Biden helped as much as he could push UAW agenda. Is that corruption?; I remember you from the Tsla investor sub days! Still an investor or not anymore?; I know, it's great to see.; I love u tho. Jerking off to you licking musky hole ; Imagine saying the same thing about NVDA or LLY last year and buying puts.; Last time Tesla was near ATH I read on Reddit about some whales entering huge short positions. They made big money but I was hesitant cause of all those lunatics buying TSLA at 300$. Not gonna make that mistake again.; Nana?  Is that you?; With risk management it won’t end bad. Just a trade; Ik it’s just memes… but there’s probably a real chance of Elon becoming a part of government and major decision making in the near future; Tesla is the only western EV maker that can sell decent EVs without the credits.

Bad for Tesla means legacy is already bankrupt/ unable to sell EVs; this

what else does reddit hate besides TSLA and BTC? 🤔; The reddit IPO literally netted me 300%.; Honestly I'd rather be lucky than good.; Lmao, yeah great leadership means your stock pumps 20%+ based on the election of a man who has been outspokenly against your industry; Yeah, stagnating revenue, ungodly high P/E ratio, unfulfilled promises, and Elon just revealed last month that he invented a bus, but worse. 

How can someone really think it's driven up by intrinsic value and strong future growth outlooks? It's a meme stock, the Elon ETF. 

Not saying the company doesn't have any real value unlike other meme stocks, but how can you honestly justify it being 1T in actual value?; Imagine be being this detached from reality. I’ve made money on Tesla several times, but come on. Let’s be honest; And the downvotes continue to keep Reddit users ignorant. We're gonna be so fucking rich.; That’s fair. Value investors have gotten brutally punished this year; You know which advertisers use X? ALL OF THEM. Because they just want to sell people shit they dont give a fuck about morality.; You're here.; He owns X. Which is a powerful tool when the rest of the mainstream media is left leaning. Essentially it’s a mutually beneficial relationship. Trump needs X and Elon needs a government that won’t attack him or his companies.; I was thinking a squeeze to $3T and another number of years consolidating there. Probably starting next year? I'm ready for whenever; you are underestimating technology progress. that will negatively affect your portfolio. missing out. I sense a Steve Ballmer on iPhone vibes... no keyboard! (inconvenient and added cost) Very short sighted; Have you tried fsd? Its on a free trial and ive been using it definitely does last mile driving. And has improved drastically; You can, go short the stock; Completely agree. Don’t worry you would have also been downvoted in 2019 😂; In the past (12 months ago) Teslas future (current day) looked like shit given its high stock price and falling growth. 

Now, Tesla is still not growing and its valuation is even higher. Teslas only hope to fill its massive valuation is solve FSD, something no one has done yet. And there’s no guarantee of it.

Tesla is overpriced, and arguably always has been over the last few years outside of a few buying opportunities.

I believe in Tesla, not so much faith in TSLA at these prices.; The big issue is for a car company priced like its a growth stock, their car sales aren't growing and competition is hotter than ever. The cars used to be the best EVs, now they're not. The self driving thing is the only advantage they have, the actual car fit and finish etc is crap, and people hate the lack of indicator stalks and other buttons. 

I used to want a Tesla now and saw them as great cars, now when I sit in them (Uber) they look and feel cheap, especially the model 3 which seems cheaper and less nice to be in than a Honda Civic.; 12 months ago the future of Tesla looked like shit, and it was shit. The stock didn’t have a good year, until these last few months thanks to nothing.

You don’t buy based on the future, otherwise you wouldn’t have bought Tesla anywhere above $150; I will be messaging you in 10 years on [**2034-11-08 15:35:36 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2034-11-08%2015:35:36%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gmkxwf/tesla_hits_1t_market_cap_for_the_first_time_since/lw3cx7b/?context=3)

|-|-|-|-|; Tell me your Degree and job right now, so I know if you can comprehend basic informations; What crying, I invested heavily in Tech companies in the last 5 years i couldnt care less, but tell me how this valuation makes sense for tesla, they dont have self driving and are way behind waymo, their robotics are legit guys in suits or with a mic behind the counter, the only thing they are is a car company with a charger network that doesnt fit the valuation; Ok where is the promised 2016 self driving ? Their ""fully automotous "" robots that will be according to musk a 30 trillion markat cap are just guys in a suit and with interns talking in a mic; This time is surely different. But maybe it doesn't have to be to make gains. DJT has billions market cap.; No, Elon literally said “brace for economic hardship”

They’re going to crash it and buy everything for pennies lol; Truth Social is tiny in comparison. X has a much wider reach. Musk himself is also a prominent right-wing influencer by now. It's just not comparable to someone like Rex Tillerson, Trump would pay a real price if he did break up with him.; The markets aren't really based in reality very often. It's a mixture of financial fact, people trying to predict other's behavior and outright manipulation. Just look at the AMC/Gamestop shit, or for a more sustained example, Tesla. They've been way overvalued for a long long time based on pure speculation and fanboyism, in reality they've missed many marks theyve set out to hit that would have cratered other companies without that social momentum. The people who understand that further drive it by also investing when it otherwise wouldnt make sense to.; That's what I said four years ago.; That’s the weird part about him, everyone just assumes what they want and ignores what he says.; depends on what you mean by ""against EVs""

Edit: i stand corrected on the total EV ban. But the other portion is 100% the truth. He changed his mind on things after he started taking Elon money, specifically stating ""I'm for electric cars, I have to be because Elon endorsed me very strongly""

Tesla doesn't even need that since their own supercharger network is much more beneficial to them & guess what? They've opened up their network to other manufacturers and standardised their chargers.; Or no tariffs on teslas; The big one -- Tesla has been selling FullSelfDriving to customers but it is still in beta so they haven't recognized all of that income yet.

If Elon gets all of the NHTSA fired from the Dept of Transportation, and he has a direct say in the writing of the national autonomous vehicle regulations, then Tesla FSD can be auto-approved nationwide with no red tape / regardless of safety, and TSLA is undervalued (they can then recognize all of that income, the uncertainty about if they will every get regulatory approval goes away); Laws can’t be written for specific companies.

Biden tried to pass the EV tax credit with a booster for union built vehicles. It got taken out because Sinema objected to that (Lucid is non-union)

So you didn’t point any actual corruption.; They're in full meltdown mode.; Don't be regarded we all know if Elon gets into any sort of power he will cut whatever department is in charge of regulations so he can do whatever he likes without anyone telling him no

His whole FSD fraud is based on the ""It's coming next year if regulations allow it"" shtick since 2014; Buying a politician using $150 Million of your own money and expecting favorable treatment is corruption. 

It's a transaction deal, the currency of sociopaths. 

That's the only kind of deal Trump does. What Elon manboy expects for his bribery is special treatment, anything he ask for approves without regulation or restriction or scrutiny. 

He wants the ability to alter power all over the planet and is using his money to do so, knowing corrupt people all have a price and can be bought.

He's a mini Trump who no one ever says no too, and threatens anyone who gets in his way or criticizes him.; Here’s a specific one, spending hundreds of millions on a campaign and getting a role in the cabinet and a lot of influence, that is one. Tell me why this isn’t corruption now?; [removed]; [deleted]; The UAW isn’t a business, it’s a labor union, a political entity. Their fundamental purpose is to demonstrate the common interest of a block of voters to politicians in order to ensure that said politicians will acknowledge the group’s needs. They are not receiving kickbacks, but participating in democracy; equating them with a private business is inane.; > raising tariffs by 4x to over 100%.

The US solar industry was devastated in the past by cheaper / unfairly priced / China-subsidized panels

First Solar seems to be doing fine in 2024 https://apnews.com/article/biden-solar-inflation-reduction-act-dca914675cd0855004214d82aab5b10c; Send pics.; Those are real businesses that are profitable and growing; Last time it was at $300 you could've shorted almost any stock and would've made money.

Did we just forget about the 2022 bear market? That wasn't a Tesla event.; Sounds like you're about to make another mistake no matter what.; Don’t be the first one to do it. Wait for Trump to take office and see if anything benefitting TSLA comes to pass. Also earnings in 2025 for yoy comparisons to make that pe look even more ridiculous.; Yeah Elon has only isolated himself against Half the country who were the real people buying his cars. He has an FSD tech not proven, unproven robots… but he is riding trumps dick. So bullish lol

Market can stay stupid for longer than you.; Probably gonna make a new position for him, and Elon will then have some clout over all the other cabinet secretaries.  Tsla 2T cap by 2026.; PYPL; Rddt. Funny how that works out; Nvidia. Reddit has a visceral hatred towards the stock, and for years now the consensus on Reddit was that it was ""overvalued and a bubble"". 

So glad I didn't listen to Reddit, I've done very well with Nvidia.  ; Anything with a high multiple; Things change. Alliances change, loyalties change. This is the real world.; RemindMe! 1 year; According to my quick Google search Tesla had profits of 15b in 2023, a lot of money but very far from 1t. 

In contrast Microsoft had a 146b profit and Aramco* 121b profit in 2023.

I think it's safe to say that Tesla is overvalued in the stockmarket, question is just how much and will the popularity of Elon keep it there.

I suppose one could argue that it's actually Elon that is worth a lot of money.; When does a meme stock stop being a meme and just become the new accepted reality? Where is the cutoff? I mean GME was clearly a meme stock and its fall reflects that. Tesla just keeps going, like BTC.; Let's see. RemindMe! 1 year; https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2024/09/05/business/advertisers-x-withdrawal. That’s just laughably easy to disprove.; You seriously think Trump care? He won he don’t need anyone support from anymore. Plus X not that much beneficial for him since a lot of people hate him and Musk there; Just a slight squeeze to 3 trillion lmao. what a joke; Unlikely to be very smart to short a high volatility stock for two years 🙄; I didn't buy into Tesla until July of this year. I also thought it looked like shit a year ago.; I'm a lead business analyst/software PM with a degree in Finance and management of information systems.; For “someone who couldn’t care less” you post an awful lot about Tesla 😂; It is by far the most successful electric vehicle company. End of story. It is not a scam just because they miss some deadlines. Don't let your hate fo Elon cloud your entire judgment.; This time is absolutely different. Neural nets and the rise of accelerated compute is a game changer. Either way, I don't really care if I convince you.; And when did Trump ever start making logical decisions balancing the pros and cons of his actions?; I wouldn’t be surprised if they come up with some way to merge em. Elon more than once tried to get Trump to “come back” to Twitter.; I am obviously not a stock market guru; otherwise, I would have enough money to stop caring about stocks.; wrong; It's legit Idiocracy and its not even a funny similarity, like it's the literal cabinet from the movie. America is cooked and deserves everything coming to it.; clowns. the whole lot of them.; You still believe that nonsense? Even left-wing media admitted it was a hoax by the Hillary campaign years ago.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/11/23/steele-dossier-igor-danchenko-indictment-scrutiny/; Legal requirement. Well that's if the law matters any more which isn't to clear it does.; I'm pretty sure they have recognized the vast majority of the FSD income if not all.; Nahh, not until they storm to Capitol to “save” democracy.; Yeah man, Tesla jumped $80 since November 5th because ...reasons.  It might just be vibes, but you're already hearing stories about Elon screwing with Taiwan because he's likely trying to trade favors with China.; Point to the action taken this past week that is corruption. You otherwise making a conjecture about the future.

Hundreds of thousands of people are using FSD every day.; Again, what corruption has happened?; Very specifically, point to how this is different than any other Democrat administration before.; He is probably asking for a government contract where all new vehicles bought by the federal government must be electric. Made in the US, more specifically by a company headquartered in Texas.
Something substantial like that.; Again, what corruption has happened?

How is this different than financiers and vote getters for Biden getting posts and favorable treatment?; [removed]; No, Biden administration absolutely abused its power to go after Musk.

I say that as someone that voted for Biden and voted for Harris.

But I am not a blind follower as quite a few others are out there.; You do know that both parties have massive funding in the millions from individual donors. SuperPACs don’t need to disclose their funding.

So, how exactly is Musk different here? Seems it’s only because you don’t like him that you find particular fault, when the game has been played this way for decades.; I am invested in FSLR…

Previously, the U.S. solar module manufacturers were devastated. But that ship has sailed. The vast revenue and workforce leaders in the U.S. solar industry are the installers and investors, and they were hurt bad by Biden’s solar tariffs. If climate change is an urgent existential risk, then why choke off the primary supply of the cheapest top tier solar modules? Domestic production will take years to bring online, and even when they do, the prices per watt will increase, which means less solar installed per $. If climate change action is so important, why do this?; Tesla dropped from 350€ to almost a 100€....at some point even TSLA had to catch up with reality and crashed much harder than other stocks.; I'm again waiting for some whales to jump in.... right now I think there is too much room left to climb.

When people to start get delusional about it, which will probaly come and fundamental dont change, thats the entry point.; He sided with trump to remove regulations around the red tape the government imposes on his endeavors. Can’t hate the player, hate the game.; ✍️; if reddit created a good search engine, and did some data science work... I'd be hella bullish; 300%; Next you're going to say DJT is such a great businessman because he's able to get a company with $1M in revenue and $20M in expenses to a $7B market cap. That's the market rewarding great leadership, not obviously manipulation and corruption; Tesla is a growth stock. MSFT has been in business for 40 years.; As long as it's still the Elon ETF. How much do you think it would drop if he decided to resign or if he passed away tomorrow? 50, 60, 70% maybe?; At this point it brought Elon political influence. Which is bigger than valuations. Especially with his net worth. I’ve talked to conservatives and they believe Elon buying X saved the Republican Party from the liberal mainstream media. 

Whether that’s true or not matters less than what people believe. And the influence gained could help Tesla and space x enough to more than offset any losses from the actual X platform; Trump is very egotistical. He wants to go down as the best president of all time. That won’t happen with an unfriendly media. 

He also probably wants long term success of republicans. And X is valuable for that; [https://imgur.com/a/hD6M2Uq](https://imgur.com/a/hD6M2Uq)

RemindMe! 2 years; Thanks for your comments. The day I see Tesla bears put their money where their mouth is, is the day I sell. But in the meantime, as long as they’re still scared, I still hold!; Well there ya go

Your wording made it sound like you originally bought years ago

Congrats on the gains; Ok then explain me, this whole marcet cap is based that tesla solves self driving and robotics, if they dont do this they are a car company, so lets look at self driving according to musk it should have come 2016 and it doesnt look like they will beat waymo anytime soon, when they are not level 4 quite anytime also they faked videos about their self driving, so why would we belive a word they say, now about robotics their robots are legit guys in a costume dancing and now in the last presentation it were inters talking with the guest with a mic XD, my old mindstome roboter was more usefull; Why cant you give counter points to my stances ? and instead write emojis in a subreddit about stocks less feelings more facts please; I hope it works out. I m not touching it at 150 PE, unless its a short; I think you are too much in your ""Trump is **obviously** a moron"" reddit bubble. The guy is definitely not stupid when it comes to interpersonal relationships. He maintained good relationships with a lot of his former enemies, once that benefitted him.; If there’s one thing Trump does, it’s abide by the law!; Elon isn't going to be a member of Trump's cabinet. He'll be in some unofficial made up role.; I don’t think relinquishing *ownership* is a legal requirement considering Trump didn’t have to do it in his first term, nor do cabinet secretaries. Even congress can still own stock, they just have more restrictions than the White House. 

He probably won’t stay CEO though, but he can just put a puppet in who does what he says. Same shit Trump did with his kids.; Are you people not aware stuff like this has been happening for decades if not longer?; The government has been on top of Musk's companies for a while now, the fact that's not gonna be a risk for 4 years is obviously pushing it's value up.; The *market* is making that conjecture.; Keep your head buried in the sand and let your new corporate overlord to plow you.; Okay then you agree it is corruption, don’t know why you had a hard time understanding it.

Tell me one person in Biden’s cabinet who donated millions and got a cabinet role?; So if Biden has some electric vehicle purchase mandates… that’s corruption?

They bought UAW built EVs.; >No, Biden administration absolutely abused its power to go after Musk.

No, they didn't, and you'll never find one example they did.

>I say that as someone that voted for Biden and voted for Harris.

Doesn't seem to make you any less of an idiot.

>But I am not a blind follower as quite a few others are out there.

Just saying it doesn't make it so, an obvious truth you seem to struggle with.; [deleted]; Meta dropped more than Tesla did and so did Netflix.

Again, this was not a Tesla phenomenon.; Well im praying it backfires and tesla proves it self to be just another car company. And all the people holding longs up here get screwed.; Trump derangement syndrome detected.; One of the top 10 highest valued companies in the fucking world just needs to grow. Why is Tesla valued as highly as companies that has grown? The 2 I looked at roughly 9x Teslas profit too.

Toyota had a profit of 45b if you want a car company for comparison.; Just goes to show how important good leadership is ;); You’re 100% right. Republicans don't realize that they are the mainstream now. If you look at the charts they have all of the top podcasts and youtube channels now. Theo Von and Joe Rogan got hundreds of millions of viewers interviewing Trump while tossing him absolute softballs. It’s embarrassing that voters are so easily influenced by social media today but there’s nothing anyone can do about it I guess.; Ah I see that i failed to mention it in my original comment. No, I agree that it looked like shit years ago. I didn't want to touch it then.; I'm aware of Musk's overly optimistic bs he has said in the past. I never bought into that. What I did buy into is that they will achieve these goals with their new neural net approach. (Thanks to the Nvidia/ChatGPT Revolution)

Waymo is fine but considering it costs them 300k to make a single vehicle, and they have a much worse supply chain, they will be crushed by Tesla's ability to scale.

Take emotion and your personal thoughts of Musk's timelines out of the equation and it really is fairly clear.

But, again, the fact that you are under this false impression is why this is an opportunity and the most undervalued AI play in the market.; Why the fuck would I have to provide counter arguments. I like the company, I like the cars, I like robots, I like the ambition. As you can literally see, nobody invests in Tesla based on their current fundamentals, but other than literally every other car manufacturer out there they have a vision, ambition, Ai, willingness to fail, a ceo who doesn’t give a fuck, they’re thinking out of the box with shit like the cybertruck. That’s what I value and not the 17th facelift model of a same Audi A5 \ bmw 1. What can expect from ford or Mercedes? The only thing I hear about them is 50 LinkedIn posts a day sucking each others dicks because the new c-class comes with a slightly different front now.; Well it's fun to hold it either way. Exciting times!; I mean, three quarters of his last cabinet hate is guts. I'm gonna guess the ratio won't be that much different this time.; There was a whole stink about his business when it did happen last time. I'm pretty sure he even had to relinquish control and put his business in a blind trust. Think his son ran it.; Can you name a specific historical example that reminds you of this?; The market is short covering.; So you have nothing.

To go with your flow, did you enjoy getting plowed by the UAW?

When GM, Ford, and Stellantis go under and lay off thousands (which has started already) due to structural uncompetitiveness due to UAW labor contracts, remember Biden.; Musk has been appointed to a cabinet role?

And since PAC funding is mostly secret, how would you know wrt Biden’s cabinet?

Again, corruption has a very specific meaning.; It's not, I was being sarcastic. It becomes corruption if the government creates a rule that all bought vehicles satisfy a condition that only Teslas meet.
BTW, fuck UAW.; It seems you don’t have the proper history. But then again, I would be surprised if you did. It’s all out there, but you let others frame things for you rather than use your own brain.; Biden orchestrated the pulling of the rural broadband subsides to SpaceX.

Biden pushed UAW allies onto the NRLB that made ridiculous rulings. Note only GM, Ford, and Stellantis had UAW organized factories for most of Biden’s term.

Biden raised the tariffs on EV and solar parts to over 100%. 

Biden’s appointed a NASA administrator that was anti-commercial space and preferred the boondoggle that is SLS, soaking up huge amounts of taxpayer money for nearly zero use. He continued with weaponizing the FAA with delays that end up making zero actual changes, just paperwork and delays.

Biden’s is close allies with the Delaware judge that went after Musk’s compensation package in a ridiculous ruling that made a mockery of the judicial process and shareholder’s rights. Shareholders voted to affirm the original vote again. Her premise for ruling is so deeply flawed, but you won’t hear the full story because the media has a vested interest to not tell you. Plus, you likely won’t want to hear it anyways.

Biden, at every turn, attempted to promote UAW related interests, which includes passing a IRA tax credit that pushes PHEVs over BEVs because of the UAW. The UAW has been anti-BEVs because their workforce doesn’t make many BEVs… Those companies and UAW workforce want to have a slower EV transition.. hence, the shift in product plans in the past 2 years.

There’s much more.; I gave examples… and the history is there to be examined by anyone curious enough.; 27 P/E vs 81 P/E, the latter of which is been juiced heavily in the past week in large part because of sentiment from the election.

It's a Tesla phenomenon, and it won't last.; Got 4 years to know.  If it ends with Elon landing a rocket on mars with a Tesla driving around on the surface while trump is president all the “suffering” people have won’t matter during this period.; Tesla semi fsd will get deregulated and it’ll be hilarious when the trucking industry gets dismantled; Me too but I can't see it crashing in the near term. 

He's positioned himself shoulder to shoulder with Trump to influence government legislation to benefit himself, not even counting the efficiency role which I'm sure will direct more power and wealth into his pocket.  

Unfortunately, the US population may be guinea pigs for his daft ideas; People have been praying and coping about buying twitter backfiring as well. That was probably the smartest move Elon has made maybe ever.; I mean if that's what you want to call people with functioning brains, sure; I wouldn't say good leadership is becoming a cult like figure that does and says completely random shit.

Improving your company is good leadership. Is having slow or no growth at all, making empty promises over and over again and putting out very few new, actually good products in years improving the company?

A goofy ass truck and a bus but way worse being the long awaited robotaxi is just a hilarious output for a 1T company in the last few years. Only thing of real value is the developments in the energy and battery side of the business; You actually dont have a clue about what you are talking about, every company that develops self driving has some maschine lerning approach and that has not a lot to do with ChatGPT or nivida revolution besides computing power besides there is no way they will ever catch up to waymo if they dont have sensors. Your second point is actually a fair point but if they archive full self driving, they could just license it to established car companies because at that point its just small changes and adding a few more sensors and cameras that is easy to do. If i take emotions out of my timeline it seems even worse because they are not even level 4 quite jet; So you just invest because of feelings that is your god giving right but then dont fucking talk like you would understand anything technical about this company.; It was his first time in office and he hired a bunch of neo con douche bags. Once he realized they sucked at their job, he fired them. Then they got butt hurt and made up a bunch on nonsense lies.

Kamala's staff absolutely hates her but they can't go to 99% of the media because it would be against their own interests to report anything negative about the Biden/Harris admin. 

Trump has incredible friends for decades. I hate to break it to you but a lot of people like the man and he likes people. Not everywhere is reddit. Trump won the popular vote and the electoral college. You should wonder why.; Biden’s Secretary of Defense was a Raytheon board member, to provide one example. There are countless examples of this across defense, pharmaceuticals and the financial sector.; I’ll also add that the example I provided is a substantially worse conflict of interest than Elon. One has an incentive to get us into wars, and the other has an incentive to subsidize electric cars.; Of what? So far, as far as we know at least, nothing Redditors are scaring themselves into thinking has happened. Trump isn’t president yet. Musk could be an advisor or the Fed chairman for all we know. The “revolving door” has been around for a century though. 

Our current defense secretary was on the board of Raytheon of all companies lmao.; TSLA Short Interest % Float is 2.84%.

This rally is not driven by short covering.; The GM CEO got paid 30 million last year…. Keep blaming the labour unions and ignore the real problems…. Im sure Elon musk is going to fix everything for you. Give him exclusive control over everything and he’ll save you! Like how protecting HD by giving them exclusive markets saved Harley Davidson from the Japanese dominating the industry. 

Your delusion and complete dissociation from reality just goes to show that Americans truly deserve whatever comes to them in the long run…
 
I don’t have any dogs in this , good luck to you.; You are truly an a brainwashed idiot.

>Biden orchestrated the pulling of the rural broadband subsides to SpaceX.

[During the COVID-19 pandemic, federal lawmakers launched the Affordable Connectivity Program with the goal of connecting more people to their jobs, schools, and doctors. More than 23 million low-income households, including Broncho’s, eventually signed on.

He didn't orchestrate anything you dope.

>Biden pushed UAW allies onto the NRLB that made ridiculous rulings. Note only GM, Ford, and Stellantis had UAW organized factories for most of Biden’s term.

Not one single ""ridiculous"" ruling you can cite that's intended to punish Elon.

>Biden raised the tariffs on EV and solar parts to over 100%.

While extending EV credits and subsidizing solar panel manufacturing while extending tax credits to solar panels buyers.

>Biden’s appointed a NASA administrator that was anti-commercial space and preferred the boondoggle that is SLS, soaking up huge amounts of taxpayer money for nearly zero use. He continued with weaponizing the FAA with delays that end up making zero actual changes, just paperwork and delays.

The same NASA that's spending more money than ever on SpaceX? NASA is so dependent on SpaceX it's become a national security concern. They literally had no backup plan for when Falcon 9 was grounded temporarily.

>Biden’s is close allies with the Delaware judge that went after Musk’s compensation package in a ridiculous ruling that made a mockery of the judicial process and shareholder’s rights.

Literally none of that is true. Musk's own emails mentioned he was negotiating with himself"" to get that package because the BOD were all his hand picked creatures. She was appointed by the Governor of Delaware you halfwit.

>Shareholders voted to affirm the original vote again. Her premise for ruling is so deeply flawed, but you won’t hear the full story because the media has a vested interest to not tell you. Plus, you likely won’t want to hear it anyways.

You won't hear it because it doesn't exist, except as a figment of your imagination. The media didn't invent Elon's emails.

>There’s much more.

Much more bullshit from another bullshit artist. You clearly have to be drinking some potent chemicals to think the world's richest man is a victim.; ""It"" being its price right now? Sure.

I'm just talking about the 2022 drop the previous guy mentioned.; yep he was able to control the stupidity of the mob and bend them to his will. elon wins.; I made money today on TSLA.  Did you?  Who is the dumb one?; Well I placed my bets and I'm quite confident. Check back in a decade later.; Your “technical understanding” missed out on becoming a millionaire investing into Tesla. I’ll take my gut feeling any day lmao.; lol this guy proved you wrong and you double down on “hurr durr it’s Reddit”; That data is always dated… and it doesn’t reflect the options OI and the resulting delta hedging shift.; Ah, what does CEO pay have to do with this? Do you have any idea how much GM’s payroll is overall?

Tesla is fine without protections… it’s Biden that has been adding protectionism. Tesla is competing worldwide with few home grown protections… unlike Chinese companies in China for instance. Or how Germany helps German automakers with public policy in the EU and the fact that some are partially government owned. Even the way most vehicles in Germany are bought on fleet contracts that favor German companies is not replicated for Tesla. And Tesla gets zero favoritism in the U.S., it just plays by the rules.

If Democrats can’t wake up to reality, they will continue to lose elections.; Bro this is the average American voter you're dealing with. Even one supposedly on the Democrat side, they just hear some blurb they FEEL is right or read some headline and roll with that as if it were 100% fact. Then someone like you, who values truth and accuracy, uses references to explain why the original view is wrong, and all you'll get is silence. That guy won't come away from this discussion having learned anything, and this is a voter from the more educated party? I used to wonder how Americans fell for the shit they did and now I have no questions about it. Proud ignorance is this country's baseline, we are just finally seeing how widespread and endemic it is.; Then that's neither here nor there, since the point is Tesla's price is juiced right now.; Best business decision for him ever. I think it's best to stop praying something happens that tanks shares due to your own bias. Like NVDA bears coping and seething too, they just missed the boat and did not see nor believed the vision the CEO had in mind.; It’s easy to make money in the market, it’s hard to keep it.; Nah it will rise a lot because musk sits in the white house, that doesnt change the fact that its not a ""good company""; yeah you could also have become a millionaire investing in gamestop doesnt mean its logical ???"
245,Are you having a laugh?!?!,"Oh, yes, alright, clickbait. But honestly, I wish I’d seen trading like this as a beginner.

Gold Pair – not a trade, a roller coaster. Keep arms and legs inside at all times.

Expected Annual Return – what’s that? People are actually making money here?

Drawdown – main leading cause of high blood pressure and heart attacks

Margin Call – it’s like a phone call from your broker, politely saying, “We’re taking all your money. Have a nice day!”

Volatility – the more volatile the market is, the more volatile my mood is.

Liquidity – the thing beginners provide, and the banks happily take.

Strategy – just try not to lose all your money… but seriously, this is a hard one to find.

Candlesticks – who knew red and green could be so stressful? You switch to calm, boring grey just to stop your heart from racing.

Support & Resistance – a relationship that the price loves to test… and sometimes even respect.

Leverage – a way to multiply both wins and mistakes… usually the latter.

Trading Bot – for when you want to lose money, but don’t want to watch the pips. You know, for a more relaxing loss.

Backtesting – works brilliantly, as long as the market never changes.

Risk Management – that one rule we all know, yet somehow skip right before the account blows.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Lmaooo; If you want a stock that goes down 5% everyday, buy ENPH 👍; Tbh i kinda find it disgusting that tesla is only going up this much bc it’s expected for elon to get the government to essentially rig the game for them. 

Ah well it is what it is, congrats to all the people making money.; There’s a great deal of chasing going on right now. I’m staying away from it. There are some companies that are okay value but most of this is euphoria at this point

I’m not selling anything, but I am Building a cash position through saving; Why do I waste my time diversifying internationally? America is insane, they just keep winning somehow.; Still think of the best things I read from this sub was a few years ago when someone was talking about how HVAC stocks are some of the best investments, just due to global warming. 

It's pretty insane how well you could be doing just by owning some names in the space, like the 1Y return is pretty incredible: 

TT - 83%

LMB -  217%

CARR - 51%

AAON - 123%

FIX - 142%

MOD - 200%

Crazy thing is that with data centers, these business are still seeing a ton of growth. Like AAON report the other day:  


>Net sales rose by 10.4% year-over-year to $313.6 million, gross profit increased by 20.3% to $113.1 million, and diluted earnings per share grew by 12.7% year-over-year to $0.62. Furthermore, the company's backlog reached a record $650 million, marking a 23.5% increase year-over-year.

I repeat, we have reached 6000.🚀; Treasury pays 4% a year, SPY pays 5% a week.; Sold BTC at $69k.

Sold UPST on a bounce to break even on stock I've been down bad on since acquiring due to CSP's I had sold.

Sold my ARK shit last week to offset BTC gains and I'm tired of looking at red.

Used proceeds from UPST sale to open position in RIVN and lower cost basis on ENPH.

I will publish my next move here so you guys can go ahead and do the opposite.; Anyone think we'll see a return of the meme stock, spacs, crypto craziness?  It feels like its starting up again.; The New York Fed is [calling out the banking sector](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr1130.pdf?sc_lang=en) and their claims the CRE mortgage space is in better shape than anticipated. This is the nicest, most corporate means of saying ""stop lying"" you'll ever read.; Is solar truly fucked?; Tesla is almost the same value as berkshire. That is just... Something man. ; Market was an odd color this morning, glad we are back to normal green fast; Rip enphase; This market is seriously unstoppable. Like there is not any scenario where it ever goes down or stops.; Costco breaking out and nearing 60x earnings feels like the jumping the shark moment for the market; $6000 does not seem to be facing the same resistance that $5000 did. Bullish signal imo

The “big dumb number” effect is real but the momentum looks to keep going.; Rklb pushing $14 ah lol, the animal spirits are certainly getting rowdy; I love how Friday are called ""fundamentals friday"" as if fundamentals matter one single bit in this joke of a market; Miss for Richemont and all luxury stocks go down.

Without the free ride i.e. Chinese luxury growth, all the luxury brands now have to actually win customers. Consumers are not buying into the large price hikes, no innovation and lower quality of their goods. This is not good for EU market as the home of luxury goods companies (France, Italy, Switzerland); Anybody watching SEZL? Shits insane; It's so wild, up like 16% this month. Crazy how just holding and doing nothing really is a great way to invest.; Presuming the likely consolidation for a couple of weeks doesn't bring the S&P down by much, the 2013 record on gains really is at risk of going down.

It's truly unbelievable. I had 5300-5400 on continuation before the year.

We are fucked.; I trimmed my positions. I've learned that every time I look at my portfolio and feel like an investing guru, a dump is waiting just around the corner.; AXON (company that makes taser and bodycams) continues on its unstoppable run. No good entry point since it’s always rising.; Anyone know why VITL stock dropped so much after earnings?; Now people are trying to pile into PSIX out of FOMO. A little late to the party.; It's rad seeing so many names go up, but one thing that kind of sucks for me personally, is that there is just not a ton of new companies hitting my screener now and days. Feels like a waiting game. 

Still wild too see some of the movement in names out there. Like LRN is up like 60% since that short report like two weeks ago.; IONQ up now \~ 70% in 2 days and 160% in a month. Thank god I didn't sell it. Bought it to hold for a decade and now I am definitely not selling it.; According to options spread, SPY looks rangebound between 596 and 600 today.; Besides Musk/TSLA and Thiel/PLTR.

And people - not here, but elsewhere - were doubting why OWL purchased their consumer loans.; Is MEDP a Trump/new admin stock? It was tanking last couple of weeks and shot up as soon as the election was decided.

Was that just general market loving the uncertainty ending. Or it is a stock favored by the new admin.; Somebody give me a reason not to buy CROX; Will PLTR ever stop going directly up?; what a fucking ponzi TSLA; Thoughts on ASML?; Haven't listen to CNBC in a minute, but they are talking about data centers and electricity. So stoked I was ahead of this by a few years.

Back when [putsRnotDaWae](https://www.reddit.com/user/putsRnotDaWae/) was still around. 

Also love how weird reddit is. Like some of us here have been talking to each other for years at this point lol. 

[WickedSensitiveCrew](https://www.reddit.com/user/WickedSensitiveCrew/) you are in there too lol.; For anyone feeling frisky, SPX is running into the 6000 option wall. You can play a 0DTE put on SPY right now and have a good chance to make a fast buck.

Andddddddd it just rejected the push.

EDIT (1:41 p.m.): And it rejected it again.

EDIT (3:37 p.m.): And again.

Don't underestimate the power of the options wall.; Chemed Corporation (NYSE:CHE) announced today that the Board of Directors has formally authorized an additional $300 million for stock repurchase under Chemed’s existing share repurchase program.

If so, in what time frame?; Reminder that cheaper does not always mean better value; Thoughts on HIMS?; TSMC monthly revenues got that 3 handle ahead of schedule. Very nice.; This is fine.; Enphase went up some 13,000% during the first Trump administration, just saying....; After digging into net and anet quarters my conclusion is both had too much baked in, neither q was actually bad imo... Net did have a weak guide though which is a no no but anet was beat and raise and split and still down... ; DKNG was -17% initially after earnings and now is almost flat. Wild; Yikes those TDW earnings do not look good; DKNG from -17% to +5%. Craziness; Adyen back to earnings lows, nibbling some more here. Happy to keep adding if it keeps dropping...; Is it time to get out of Enphase?; Good on me for selling $ABNB yesterday before close and adding into $MELI. Chesky needs to get his shit together; I opened a small position in $DOW today which is at a 52 week low down -5% today due to just being replaced by Sherwin-Williams in the Dow Jones, IMHO.; Are Japanese car stocks bad buys right now due to potential Trump tariffs? I'm specifically looking at Toyota right now, but the question does apply to anything that might be affected.; LOPE up another 5% today… is it gonna keep going?; Saw my portfolio gains this week, bought myself a PS5 Pro. 

Didn’t sell any stock, but felt good either way.; Did SPY touch 600; Anyone follow STNG? Came across them on my screener. Seems really cheap and possibly a good entry; I wonder if another Bill Hwang type of event will happen..which would also screw me over =(; This is an ideal entry point for anyone interested in gold stocks. The speculative atmosphere + poor stimulus news from China has people selling positions to chase yield or overreacting to bad earnings reports from the major companies. Neither change why gold has climbed in price and will continue to do so.

Also, noteworthy that the Mag 7 (except Tesla) and SMH finished negative today while all the major indices were positive.; /r/stocks

Twitter. Stock twits,

All filled with people calling this a bubble. I guess higher we gooo; People always say don't buy Costco at this price... just wow; someone please explain to me how the stonk market works....

we pull forward to SPX 6000 and assume perfect earnings, and then we sell if those expectations are not met?; Euphoria ⚠️; [deleted]; I can't believe I am even asking this question, but is anyone in PYPL thinking about an exit strategy? Its performance is now beating S&P 500 YTD but lagging the NASDAQ. Lot euphoria in financials right now so not sure where this is going.

All the talk a few months back was how  PYPL needed a catalyst or whatever. But I don't see any catalyst having occurred... was just cheap and is now less cheap. Apple and company is still eating their lunch right?; [deleted]; sezl explode; $Net thoughts?; Managed to squeeze out of nelnet premarket at only - 2% or so, now - 8% looked like a rough q from my reading last night; Bruh I don’t understand QCOM. Earnings were good, weren’t they?; Bought INOD at about 7.5, sold at about 7. That one hurts. I’m too good at this.; [deleted]; Nclh 76% in 3 months…is that the pricing in of the wars ending or is that still to come? I hit my price target, 2 years of waiting, I need to sell but I can’t bring myself to do it…; DDOG down 5% after crushing estimates and giving good guidance ??; INOD , UPST go crazy , sold too early, lol.; [removed]; Thoughts on AXP? It's up bigly this year; Must be some of short squeeze or gamma squeeze on tsla; Had anyone sold stocks at a loss to offset the tax they owe on RSUs?; Newbie investor here, still trying to learn the market. 

If a company's products go up in price when it comes to selling their product to the consumers, what does that usually entail for the stocks of that company? A net positive? Or a net negative?

Just trying to learn how a company/sector's news affect their stocks and how to gauge it. Thanks!; tax question:

-i buy 100 shares of XYZ in june at $25 ($2500)

-i sell 100 shares of XYZ in november at $50 ($5000)

-29 days later XYZ is trading at 40 and i buy 125 shares ($5000)


do i have to pay any capital gains tax?

thanks; Why does goog seem to really lag compared to some of the other large players?; Is the market overpriced right now? I recently received a nice work bonus of around $20k and I’m thinking of investing it for a house purchase within the next 5 years. I believe a good entry price for $VOO is around $500 or  $SPY at $550 which I think should be the equivalent.

Do you think we’ll see these prices again anytime soon?; is Elmo gonna be the next president or what. This is insane; Heard on a podcast today: “Japan is looking toppy.” How so? What does that mean?; Huge day for ITA, up over 4%.; Is there a Prison Industrial Complex ETF? I'm not even joking, I'm looking to get in a long position; Wondering if it’s good entry point for BA; app sezl inod , stocks of the days. DXYZ best meme stock of the day; [deleted]; tsla gamma squeeze alert. they're trying to smoke the 300c writers.; [deleted]; Anyone else thinking about moving into cash \~Jan 19? You know the reasons.; Why is vital farms dumping?; $SQ with the huge drop, I feel like sentiment is at a low point for it's services. For me, someone who believes in it long term, I picked up a small amount more. It's growth isn't quite at projections (barely off I feel like)  but Bitcoin surges help SQ immensely, and cashapp is a product I use everyday and has done well for me. Finnancial companies are set to see growth almost across the board, while fintech is slightly different I see deregulation (or whatever trump ends up doing)as a positive for them; Even weirder is that some the states don't even do daylight savings, like Arizona. Really hope we get rid of it in the future.; all green energy down since Trump has opposite idea ya know? invest in guns and ammo; Well US is an oligarchy so its to be expected; That's how I feel. I'm happy with what I own and glad I bought the last few years. However, I'm in no rush and will wait for things to open up. There will always be new opportunities. 

I just hate that it's boring now. Like I actually enjoy researching and finding new companies and just really nothing new is showing up in my screeners.; Thing can’t have the most basic pullback. No profit taking to be had. It just goes up and up and up and up ; Same. I'm being very cautious. Trimmed my portfolio a little bit before the tech crash yesterday and took some profits. I'm planning to DCA slowly over the next 6-12 months because I'm worried of instability.; Just buy US big tech forever, infinite money glitch; I think about that too. I've held ex-US for like a decade now and it has barely gone anywhere.; There have been a bunch of reports lately about US equities under performing international over the next decade; yep. Better gradually learn to all in . MSTR APP SEZL; HVAC and grid/power solution companies should be goated because of climate change and AI ramp up (we are cooking this planet but at least we will make money out of it). 

My only doubt would be that Trump is going to follow the market directions, which means MAG7 directions, so M&A and near monopolies may squeeze out the small and up-and-coming companies.; what should i look for when analyzing an HVAC company to invest in?; Chill, vegeta; Absolutely insane. I'm a bull and even I'm worried for this bubble at this point.; recently goldman or jpmorgan was just saying SPY would have single digit yearly gains going forward.; thank , just pick up UPST today!; I think we should let C grade winners run, and cut back on A grade. I'm talking UPST and ABNB respectively; Ive said this before but if the market ever lets me get a run at special purpose acquisition trading again I think I could retire early. I did like +400% in one year knowing almost nothing but got a feel for it pretty fast, with the amount of knowledge I gained from then till now it would be like shooting fish in a barrel; Where would the household liquidity that powered that bubble come from?; Pltr and tsla and arm are all meme bubbles; mstr coin hood the trio; Idk about special purpose acquisition companies being included, but there's a very real alternate world from what I think could happen (something that's 2018 esque) where basically everything that's 2020 themed runs like crazy for at least a year and a half.; It’s been a big topic (and probably a large driver in RTO) for a while now, based on that report it seems like the next 3 years or so are going to be the most vulnerable time for the overall economy. I guess everyone is counting on asset inflation outpacing interest rates to keep the extend and pretend party going.; If you don't mind me asking, what do you for a living? You know so much about business and markets, it's really cool!; Costar has commentary on the real estate market in all their calls, and is worth checking out even if you don't own the company.

They see CRE bottoming and activity picking up soon.; for the next 4 year's; Yep; I don't own it but the obliteration of ENPH is impressive. I'm almost considering buying some just from a technically oversold perspective.; in the short term, maybe; Just insane. I want to short it since it's massively overvalued, but this market is delusional right now; I panic sold in the summer, sad to see that was right; We had dips last april and last summer. It will dip eventualy. Just buy more when it does!; I guess even if Trump tries to crash the market with his ignorant shit there's still ZIRP to bail him out...; This is more a seasonal pattern than euphoria. Costco always moves higher between November 2nd and November 19th. This is when institutions and pension funds start cycling it into their holdings.; Not PLTR being up 45% in a week after showing 30% Rev growth YoY and now having almost 45 PS ratio lmaooo; it's looking more and more like what Goldman Sachs said is true...  

money managers are chasing end of year performance. Their jobs are on the line.

they are indiscriminately buying all the dogshit; The only fundamental you need is vibes; That's a wild ride.; this must be the top. The more I wait, the more I have to pay. damnit; yessir!!; sure fucking seems like it.

i have high suspicion of a new years rug pull. 

This stinks of the 2021 ponzi; What 2013 record are you referring to?; plenty of room for more players in the robotaxi industry. Waymos problem is their tech costs too much to scale massively right now.; [removed]; Then short it and make millions.; Is it only bad when it’s Tesla, but good when it’s Lockheed, Boeing and Raytheon?; Don’t be naive, all billionaires do this. Bill Gates gave Harris $50 million.; [removed]; Hahaha its great, wondering if my nvda position need trimming; I considered buying it after George Floyd. Whoops.; I've been eyeing it for months and it never drops Holy shit; This sub loves to sleep on Axon. I bring it up all the time, and it never gets any traction. Oh well. Enjoying my ~$180 entry point.; Oh my god, it's over 600 now! 28% pump today?!!; Earnings weren’t egg-zactly what the market was looking for.; Jesus that chart looks crazy. What happened?; Mag 7 is the answer for majority of the questions on sub.  For non Mag 7 stocks that dont get brought up as much PE firms such as KKR, APO, OWL, and BX. 

Also JPM, GS, and MS since there will likely be more mergers and acquisitions and they are the picks and shovels of that were you benefit no matter which company gets bought out.; I wonder if EDR would see anything, since Dana White has close connections with the new admin.; My porftolio has dropped 2% since trump was declared the winner - I have international exposure and healthcare exposure. the drop was enough to outweigh the increases in my other stocks.; Well I know there was some China news around TSM is stopping some advanced chip production. Also wonder if it could be related to the all the Tarif talks?; International and better-valued stocks are getting killed while meme and overvalued stocks are mooning. It actually makes total sense; Considering the uber leftist (not in the superficial woke leftist US sense) woman who is Mexico’s president…I have my doubts Trump will do much that benefits Mexico.; I know some people have brought up PAC before. I'm also curious, haven't really found any direct Mexico companies, but I've done well with onshoring in the states plays with FLEX and JBL.; [deleted]; Sold when I was up 130% and somehow still regret it. Actually think you might've flagged it right at the start based on some twitter DD which led to me buying.; the time to invest is before earnings....; I think it has the potential to reach $350 from here based on technicals. I'd put a stop loss at $272, and if it breaks $321 I'd move the stop up to $301.; For a long term hold, should be solid, but not sure what Trump will mean for semis as well. One thing to call out, is that not all semi's are the same. A lot of equipment makers as well companies that deal with auto/industrials have seen declining sales for like the past year or so.

That's what would make actually bullish, is that the market will bottom sometime in the future for the weaker sectors.; Yea. PE firms often give you great tips on what to invest in. Blackstone/BX was pounding the table on data centers and even bought out a publicly traded data center REIT in June 2021.

If one took the risk and bought IRM in 2021-2022. You would be up over 100% on your shares.; Seems like most growth names are running, I'm not reading to much into specifics for most things.; maybe when they get 100 PS they will slow down.; Same for IONQ; Negative momentum sine July. I'd forget about it for a while, there are so many other opportunities in this raging bull market.; Might be stagnant but im jumping in at these levels. Im not chasing those raging bulls.; Puts reminds me of a certain cosmic being.; yep been here since 2020; I think next year I'm going to take the plunge and start looking into options. I never messed with derivatives, but really feels like a place where you can make a ton of money.; feels like we shouldn't underestimate the fomo.

some goldman sacks insider just said money managers around the world are underperforming and chasing this shit.

if they don't chase, they get fired after xmas.; It's kind of wild there is like 14M shares on the float.; based on history, within 6 months.

have fun waiting.; All auto semi stocks this year are proof of that ; What's that mean?; Sounds more like a coincidence than anything; so go all in; A lot of ANET’s gains have been pulled forward. It’s a great company obviously but I’m just not sure it will provide massive returns the next couple years

Not sure about NET; Yea. Surprised they didnt get an earnings thread on here given that it took place in AH yesterday. So there could have been a discussion if that -17% drop was justified. Like happens with other stocks when they report earnings.

Guess the market gave the answer that a -17% drop was overreaction.; I'm looking through the 10-Q filing and I think the selling is overblown.; $STRL was down like 12% when the market opened yesterday, clawed back up, and now is up 8% today. Not as crazy of a swing, but still wild to see how people/algo are acting on some of these reports.; The initial reporting had them missing EPS so the algos sold it off. Once other reporting came out that they beat on EPS it made their earnings look a bit better than what came out at first.; yup, get out when the stock is at a new 4 year low. 

then buy back in when the company recovers in a year since they arguably sell great products.; buy high, sell low; Most Toyota cars sold in USA are manufactured in USA so I would think tariffs would have little affect.; PS5 brought to you by Donald J. Trump; 599.63

SP500 did cross 6k though; You should be careful around tanker stocks right now. The whole sector is in a severe downturn sentiment-wise, and it will take a while to find the bottom. I'm very bullish on them as a long-term play but the thesis should only start bearing fruit in 2026.; stonk only goes up. They just miss out; You do you, but I would never listen to anything off StockTwits.; LMAP 58 PE for costco.

Cost, TSLA, ARM, PLTR all having a funny competition on who can be the most overvalued stock; The stock market isn't rational.; Yes we go up forever. Have an occasion down day or 2, but that just leads to a very fast V. So basically a forever bull market. ; no, we continue to pump even if earnings arent great.

earnings dont matter. valuations dont matter. nothing matters other than green green green every day until the heat death of the universe; Them superpowers getting neutralized, I can only watch in silence🗣; Load up on it under 200$ tbh, I have been getting some shares between 140-175.; Cheapest mag 7 stock with insane fundamentals, under 200 its bargain; Should soon; google really have a lot of love in reddit. So, legend say you should inverse reddit. Google is a stagnant business .; I bought $PYPL because I thought it was just ridiculously mispriced (probably because lots of retail dumped it because they got burned). DCF implied something zero to slightly negative fcf growth. Thought buybacks and new management could do quite well for the stock but now it seems like a lot of that has gotten priced in.

If I had more confidence in their moat this could be a longer time hold but I need to do more DD for that. Paytech seems to be really competitive with Adyen, SQ and a bunch of other players eating up some market share.; If you care about TA: looks like volume is nothing special so it's just running with the rest of the market. I think it may face strong resistance at 83.7 and then around $87.7-$89, if it breaks that just let it keep running.; I bought pretty close to the bottom and wasn’t really planning to hold this long, I thought the rebound to this sort of level or higher would be much quicker. Might hold out a couple more months but planning to sell fairly soon.; Hard to know what wallstreet is even pricing in nowadays; What's driving its growth?; Worries about Apple ending their relationship and them losing their Arm license overshadow good earnings I assume; Didn’t the stock gain like 8% off the earnings? People taking profit from a move like that isn’t t that crazy. ; They had quite a run, but I've posted about them here for months. They were super cheap, but great company. The big thing for me that I was sold on was the fact they have higher enrollment now than compared to covid. 

Plus there is kind of the culture wars around education in the US.; No idea, only thing that stands out to me, is the stock is still crazy expensive, even for a SaSS company. Also the guidance isn't good enough for how expensive they are: 

[https://www.barrons.com/articles/datadog-earnings-stock-price-45a50907](https://www.barrons.com/articles/datadog-earnings-stock-price-45a50907)

>That’s partly because the market is forward looking and the company’s forecast was nothing to write home about. DDOG said it expects revenue between $709 million and $713 million for the fourth quarter. The mid-point of this range at $711 million is below the $712 million priced in by Wall Street.; Same as NET, p/s and expectations so high that even with decent news its not enough; Has been since IPO; I have. 

Not sure of all cases, since I have some stocks that are from my employee stock program, since there is double tax, but I usually tax harvest my DSUs. 

However, stock has been on tear, so no longer really have any shares at a loss.; Depends on pricing power. If it's something consumers gotta buy then great for stock. If there's alternatives and people flee the product then bad for stock.; Other factor not mentioned is if cost of production also go up. If costs go up and company raises price in response, margin is the same. Ideally you want to see cost stay the same or fall and price rise. Example: oil company gets better at drilling so their cost of production falls but the price of oil globally rises so they can charge more.; Yes, rebuying doesn't matter for gains it only matters for losses... If you ever sell with gains those gains are now taxed and if you rebuy the cost basis is the price. It's only when realizing losses that cost basis will get adjusted by rebuying within the set period ; Google has a woke buttermilk culture and unwilling to take risks. See how msft had to be the one to start the ai craze when google been sitting on it for a decade. Also lots of projects they just sorta let die.; The market has been making new highs for 232 years.  One could have asked if it was too high for all of these years and been wrong; Nobody can see the future.; An option is to get in partially like $5k rather than lump sum.; No. Africans can't be president. Are schools no longer teaching the constitution? Same with Arnold that people here on reddit kept claiming would be the next president after he became ruler of CA. He can't because he is European which also isn't allowed.; the actor?!; Any time someone attempts to predict the market ask does this man or woman have a record of being correct and billions of dollars in profits from tradig?; One thing you can do is just find a company you like and see how has the biggest holdings. Like GEO is a private prison, just look up which ETF owns the most:

I doubt there will be a prison one specifically, but just keep in mind, when dealing with thematic ETFs, you usually have higher expense ratios.; [Bureau of Prisons (BOP) Awarded Contracts | Federal Compass](https://www.federalcompass.com/federal-government-awarded-contracts/by-gov/Bureau-of-Prisons-(BOP)); It's called SPY; BA BA black sheep; A few of us discussed this a few days ago and said that we expect a rally after the election regardless of who wins. There seemed to be general agreement, a few upvotes, not much arguing the contrary.; Musk is still saying it is going to crash. Look at the posts here on reddit giving him credit for being right.; Also the democrats lost because they didn’t push the Palestine and Trans issues more according to what I have been reading here. Inverse Reddit to make money. After all, this is the birthplace of r/antiwork and limp wrists.; trying and suceeding.

clown market. TSLA at 320 is too fucking hilarious; Both. Twitter/X is very pro-Trump so there's bias. Trump is probably gonna be easier when it comes to regulation and overall business practices which companies like. So for the stock market, it might turn out alright.; A lot of people on Twitter are literally Nazis; No, just look at an sp500 chart and it basically goes up and to the right over the long term no matter who the president is. Don't let fear drive your investments.; It's nonzero that we replay 2018 to an extent, but I don't think it'd be worth it to sell out entirely due to that.


I actually think there's another path where this gets completely absurd and all the stuff from 2020 wakes up and runs like crazy, then Trump holds the bag of the start of the next secular bear market.; MSNBC claiming there’s going to be an insurrection on Jan 6 and fear mongering is ridiculous. Don’t fall for that. ; Because no clever arrangement of bad eggs ever made a good omelet.; haven't touch them since 3 months ago. But might be because of they have to spend money to build factory or something. Mr. Market doesn't see any potential grow in it. 

Vitl is in heavy competitive market. customer can buy eggs from local farmer at dirt cheap with comparable quality .; Huge .92% drop?; Oh the entire US doesn’t do that? That’s interesting.; Or invest in LNG assets.; Funny enough, one of my midcap defense names is up pretty big lol. It’s like 20% the last few days. ; I like the boring. There are more tickers being discussed now than there ever was doing the bear market in 2022.  When the bear market actually happens and stocks are down 20-50% off high this sub becomes hostile about it. Or they become silent about what they are buying. At least now I can collect tickers to put on a watchlist for the next dip.; Agreed. It’s truly just about watching the current companies I own and seeing the gains for now. Not interested in going fishing for anything overpriced; Sounds like a meme but you are correct; but but isn't tech stock always expensive, overpriced for the past 30 years. The bubble can pop any moment, there's always the 2000 2008 risk. I don't wanna buy high and sell higher.; The Trump era will most likely be good for small caps. The Biden era was terrible due to disproportionate regulatory impacts for companies that weren't billion-dollar empires.; That I have no idea about. Personally, I still think it's going to be a lot of tailwinds, just due the those factors. I feel like I've been rewarded as an investor from owning these names the last few years. 

Also started talking about buying companies that deal with Naval and Military Components, like CW and DRS.; I'm a big believer of just using fundamentals. A lot of these names has seen a wild run. However, a company like FIX has been growing pretty rapidly.

>net income was $146.2 million, or $4.09 per diluted share, as compared to $105.1 million, or $2.93 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $1.81 billion compared to $1.38 billion in 2023. The Company reported operating cash flow of $302.2 million in the current quarter compared to $214.2 million in 2023.

>Brian Lane, Comfort Systems USA’s President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “We are happy to report record earnings and cash flow this quarter, as our employees continue to achieve unmatched execution for our customers. Recently acquired companies exceeded our high expectations, and each of our operating segments excelled in every respect. Quarterly per share earnings were 40% ahead of the same quarter last year, and through nine months our per share earnings were 60% higher than in the same period last year. Cash flow surpassed any previous quarter, and that extraordinary cash flow is both a great base for continued investment and a definite signal of strong underlying trends in our execution, customer relationships, and prospects.”

>Backlog as of September 30, 2024 was $5.68 billion as compared to $5.77 billion as of June 30, 2024 and $4.29 billion as of September 30, 2023. On a same-store basis, backlog increased from $4.29 billion as of September 30, 2023 to $5.17 billion as of September 30, 2024.

I've had the same theory around investing here for years, which is physical data center, HVAC, electrification, companies that have tailwinds with IRA/Infrastructure bill. A lot of these have overlap as well.; Goldman Sachs and Vanguard.; What's special about SPAC trading?; Any dumb fad that starts we should be quick to jump in and leave; Dunno.  Money markets?  Aren't there trillions still there?  Also like 68 trillion in wealth transfer from boomers to millenials over the coming decade.

I'm going by vibes here though.; I mean we’re gonna see more ipos, mergers, and acquisitions.  Plus less regulation - at least in the crypto space. On top of trump pinning his presidential success partly on stocks go up.; I'm a buyside analyst and portfolio manager.; Which subsector? CRE is a broad brush, and some of them are artificially depressed by fear connected to office space.; I'm down 50% fuck; Don't. The technical momentum is massive. It has the potential to get near $400 next year if it breaks through the resistances at $314.5 (did just now), $318.7, $364, $384; Rule #1: Never short TSLA; [deleted]; The what?; Especially as the tariffs and deportations are looking more and more likely, we're in for some ""hardship"".; It does cost a lot (iirc 200k), but it should get cheaper over time (esp if they continue partnerships with car manufacturers. Right now they only have hyundai). 

&nbsp;

But since they're running 150k-200k rides per week, they're still growing pretty quickly. Who's the 2nd automated driving service after waymo? and how many rides do they run per week?; Thank you Redditor, very cool; I'll wait until the earnings report after the EV tax credits are removed; Let me know when those ceos are part of the administration whispering in the presidents ear; Was Bill Gates going to be in her administration?; I don't own Google?; Ferguson, baby.; Yep, looks like those earnings left investors a bit scrambled :)  They are facing headwinds with rising expenses but the drop seems to be an over-reaction. Curious if anyone spotted anything specific that may stand out?; Beginning from last year the company has pivoted to the Power Systems segment of its clientele (data centers, utilities, etc.), which has incredibly high margins and demand. I got in at $9 after seeing the YoY increase in gross margins and their dedication towards manufacturing custom enclosures for the data center space.; Only thing I can think of is maybe mergers. I dont see how the new admin could help WWE and UFC grow revenue. Which would again favor the picks and shovels play I mentioned of JPM, GS, and MS.; Mine is up. Most of what I have is in VTI, but I also hold VEA which has gotten killed. AAPL, META, AMZN, MSFT, and NVDA have all had one good day and two down days.; I hold VEA which is developed markets, but I guess the tariffs aren't just for China. I don't really know.; Tariffs and a lunatic who has shrugged whenever asked if the US will protect Taiwan.  He loves a dictator so lotsa folk worrying China finally gets its wish.  And Putin.; An additional potential tailwind for Mexican airports is the increased traffic if Republicans follow through with their plans to ramp up deportations. Most deportations happen by air and these are paid for by the US government - I believe Trump has said 'no price is too high' for the cost of mass deportations.

Not sure exactly who would stand to benefit though or even if it's a good thesis with any substantial benefit or if its a dumb idea, need to do more research but just something I was thinking about. I already hold some PAC as a reshoring play anyway; Not sure how that changes companies moving into Mexico for manufacturing. I mean a ton of companies have been moving manufacturing there for a while. 

It's also the largest US trading partner:

I suppose it depends on how tough on China Trump wants to be really; [deleted]; [I agree, the time to invest was many earnings ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/183gyxf/rstocks_weekend_discussion_saturday_nov_25_2023/kar6t01/). Most of my position is sold so I'm not really benefiting much from today's price action anyway.; I've basically sold out entirely and just have a lingering position. 4 shares out of original 14. Could have sold much higher than when I did (between $160 and $240) but relative to my cost basis ($110s) I was happy with it.; That’s a good shout I didn’t think about the auto side and what not, I still do some research but might allocate less of my monthly investment until I feel abit more confident; OWL's more invested in private credit these days. But they're very conservative and only work with investment-grade companies with stellar credit quality. Retail investors were acting like they didn't dissect UPST's risk profile and the whole agreement was a big error in judgment.; same for sezl; What do they do?; I've lost track at this point.; No, definitely not. Cosmic is too bullish certain commodities. Puts' alts were around like 2-3 weeks ago but actually recently have disappeared. (I'm usually able to identify instantly); It's so funny think we've like all interacted with each other for years; or lose a ton a money; The profit factor for derivatives can be mind-blowing if you have a proper strategy. It's a whole different ballgame though that requires a different skillset than traditional investing. Fundamentals are irrelevant.; I'm not talking about how high the market will go in the future, only the technical exposure in the SPY for today that limits how far it can reasonably move. The options distribution shifts every trading day.; Average volume: 72k

You get a lot of long term holders with that mindset though. Still the most interesting company, in terms of verticals. Plumbing and hospice care. Which is basically the result of management being opportunistic above all else.; Which in theory is the time we should be buying, if looking longer term.  

Really wild just kind of waiting around but I think I’m going to start moving some capital to work in the space next year. ; TSMC reports revenues monthly per Taiwan law, and the number reached 3xx,xxxM Taiwan dollars for the first time, earlier than I expected.


https://investor.tsmc.com/english/monthly-revenue/2024; Pretty much; Yea that's fair I think. Not sure what to so with my own tbh, valuation makes me concerned but selling great companies on valaution alone usually bites me; Interesting I have to dig deeper. I saw the lowered guidance and it spooked me a bit but haven’t sold; Not sure which companies are there, but isn't there a ton of car makers in Mexico as well?; Don’t know much about the industry but want to learn more. Glad I have a year or so to learn judging by your post lol; For reals, I don't get it. I bought at 400 so I am set basically, an incredibly great move I didn't plan, I just love the store; In theory, aren't you just explaining Buffet's idea of never bet against America? 

Even on top of that, there will be down years in the market, but usually the it takes some black swan that brings about a recession to really kill the market.; Or until our monetary and fiscal policies catch up to us; Then everyone just needs to go long and World poverty is going to be resolved. 
Easy.; The famous stocks we once knew is looking paranoid and now is spiraling 📉; Ngl I'm not a TA guy whatsoever and probably never will be, but appreciate the comment anyway; i can't share the screenshot. You could check out ""sezl eps"" it list its financial for the last 4 quarter. EPS through the roof.

I'm ready for a dip, through. This is insane. Insane than APP yesterday; There’s double tax on DSUs? I assume yes just like RSUs charge an RSU tax and then capital gains if you sell. Im not entirely sure if Im planning to sell my RSU shares yet but I have other losses in personal accounts; I see. So it all depends on whether the company is offering something that's needed for people's daily lives vs. something that they can live without getting said product.

This does not bode well for the techonology sector... Anyway, I appreciate the response!; Ah yes. I had a feeling margin should fall into play somewhere and there it is. Thank you so much!; thanks. i was hoping there was sort of a reverse-wash-rule thing in effect. guess i'll keep holding my PLTR 😁; elon musk, the actor!; Lol it’s Josh Brown. Pretty mixed success rate I would say 😂; Elon musk could eat a literal shit sandwhich and say it tasted better than wagyu and his brain dead cult would start catching their shit and eating it.

Have an actual physics degree and following whats happening in the physics world today, then seeing Elon talk about colonizing mars makes my head want to explode with how dumb he sounds; Won't last though, but the ones who hold today's are toast; Less worried about the investments and more about, all competition is killed, regulations gone, Tesla is the only company left. Though I suppose once our money becomes worthless it won't really matter where it's kept.; I wasn't in the game in 2018, but I remember the swings and the whims. And this sub has brought it up plenty.; That's a neat assumption you've made but every word in that sentence is incorrect. I don't watch MSNBC, I'm not worried about another Jan 6. But it's neat seeing you MAGA trash getting bolder with daddy coming back.; Sorry, the timeframe I chose was from yesterdays peak, theyre down about 5% in that time. For most stocks 5% is a pretty big jump in a short amount of time(albeit not so much recently); As a software engineer, dealing with time zones is super annoying. ; private prisons where it's at; private prisons are up as well, shit is sad as fuck; Totally. 

Like POWL is up like over 50% from October 1st. So crazy.; Tech was fairly depressed in the 2000s.; Also based off how the market is moving, wonder if we see more mergers, since a lot of the midcap names could just end up being acquired.; The $10 nav floor, it lets you use options in a way that would usually be suicidal to leverage capital aggressively; > Aren't there trillions still there?

Half of that is Warren Buffet's; Makes total sense. It's nice having you here and ty for all your nuggets. I'm such an amateur  with all this stuff, but just love researching companies and what not.; Fanciest term for pyjama trader I've ever heard!; Very true. Here's their exact commentary:

""Finally, I want to touch on the economy and what we're seeing in the real estate economy. The commercial real estate economy has started to show signs of potential improvement from what I think is probably a cycle bottom. Office prices are down 18% over the past year and currently sit 43% below their peak level. It'd be a little worse if we were doing that in real dollars. Multifamily prices are down 11% over the past year and are 25% off from their peak. Industrial and retail prices never saw as big a decline and are down only 5% from their peaks.
The multifamily sector continued its recent trend of better-than-expected renter demand with 174,000 units being absorbed. This puts absorption for the year on pace to be double last year's levels and to be near the record levels last seen in 2021.
But with the wave of new construction that the sector has seen, strong absorption was not enough to match deliveries and vacancies remained at elevated levels currently at 7.9% and would increase a bit. With 720,000 units still under construction, those vacancy rates, I think, will remain at upper levels for quite some time. The office sector hit an all-time high in vacancy this quarter, but I'm becoming somewhat optimistic that we're about to see a turn.
The rate of increase in vacancy is slowing to a crawl. One important lead indicator, sublet vacancy, is now clearly falling. Another leading indicator, total availability is already falling. The spread between vacancy and availability is shrinking usually indication of early signs of recovery.
Leasing volume is back to pre-pandemic levels, though with smaller average lease size, suggesting a larger number of overall leases being signed. New construction underway at 82 million square feet is the lowest level seen since 2013 and not far from the lowest levels ever seen. These low levels will eventually translate into shrinking vacancies and rising rates, rents, back up the truck and load up on quality distressed office buildings on 10x.""

I'm sure there's variation across markets as always, but a general bottoming seems to be starting; OWL and the other PE companies because...reduced regulation and more possible acquisitions?; agree they are ahead but if they can do it, others can do it too.; They gonna double the credit for elon; Oh boy…you don’t know about those board members, lobbyists and their past jobs I guess. 
Musk is amateur time in comparison, but of course because it’s an evil electric car company associated with Trump instead of the lilly white MIC, it’s more controversial.

Zero logic, just pandering to tribal thought patterns.; True, just OP was asking around contacts with the new admin. Just I know dana white has a very close relationship with Trump, so that's why I phrased as a wonder, since not sure if it will, but fits what OP was asking for.; I remember some 147% ago arguing with a certain someone that I should just buy Google (which I own). But to their credit, that is probably the better move in general, this stock just turned out to be a gem.; I've been looking into $OWL recently ended up on my screener. I haven't been able to figure out what the bull case is for this company. Any hints?; What do they do?; Something with quantum computers; Agreed. I never really had too many issues with Puts, but they did that thing where they started get kind of toxic and call people out. Part of why I stopped posting as much, just wasn't as fun. 

Cosmic has been nothing but friendly with ever interaction.; Its a little mini community.

puts is still here. he lurks mostly. I think he gets banned very unfairly; That's why I've always avoid it. However, I feel like years of actively investing now, I feel like I'm ready to take the plunge.; Feels like nowadays they're irrelevant for stocks too; I don't really follow the plumbing space as much lol. I really regret getting out my MLI position years ago. Haven't looked at the numbers but **WMS** is down like 15% off their earnings. 

I kind of like companies with higher stock prices since it does usually lead to less volume and liquity, which I don't mind when holding long term.; Not saying theres no money to be made there, but speaking as someone in the health industry and knows people running hospice agencies, hospice is a rough sector; I am considering as well, Infineon has earnings soon might take a swing on it; I always like the idea of taking out your initial investment or part of it, since they are technically playing with house money. ANET is the type of company you just hold. Valuation doesn't matter to me until I start seeing sales or red flags.; To piggyback off this, even Chinese auto makers are moving to Mexico: 

[https://mexiconewsdaily.com/business/byd-plant-mexico/](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/business/byd-plant-mexico/)

""...although some experts have theorized that BYD building a plant in Mexico is a strategy to attempt to skirt U.S. tariffs on Chinese products by importing their cars to the U.S. from inside the USMCA free-trade zone.""; I don't follow car manufacturing that closely.  I did see all of Toyota, Honda, and Nissan reported weak earnings due in part to weakness in China. 

 Deere & Co was in the headlines recently w/ Trump for moving some manufacuring to Mexico. There is an argument to be made that Mexico might pick up some of China's manufacturing due to cost & deglobalization.; They are closely aligned with the commodities sphere and engage in similar harmonious cycles with whatever they're transporting. If you time entrance and exit correctly - which tends to play out over 8-10 years - you can make a fortune as individual stocks will rise 200-2000%.; Down years, LMFAO! Like 1 out of maybe every 10/15 years; lmao catch up to us?

what do you mean. We can just print more money, pump stocks, and solve that. 

No more recessions. No more red months. No more food or money for the bottom 50%. Anything so that the corpoorations and ruling class can have their cake, eat it too, and have an extra 10 cakes lying around to fuck or destroy or whatever they feel liek; I assume any stock that's up 25x over the last year has something going for it. 😉 But what specifically about its services has caused such a huge leap?; Yeah, like I have RSU and then I do the employee stock plan. Our plan takes the low price on the purchase date between this year and last year. Then we get a 15% discount off that price. So for those, you have to pay the tax in the price difference and a tax on capital gains.

  
Also, I use a CPA who helps out with this stuff. I found an awesome local one on nextdoor app and always suggest talking to a professional with this type of stuff.; What double tax you are referring to?

0 to ""Vest Value"" is added in your income and taxed accordingly.

""Vest Value"" to ""Sell Price"" is capital gain/loss.

I hope you aren't taking cost basis for capital gain as 0, based on your double tax comment.

And yes, you can offset your capital gain/loss on RSUs against other capital loss/gain.; Nope, the government wants you to pay tax basically ASAP lol; > Have an actual physics degree and following whats happening in the physics world today, then seeing Elon talk about colonizing mars makes my head want to explode with how dumb he sounds

Could you expand?; It jumped on election day along with all Financials and came down yesterday w financials like jpm. It was down AH cuz of earnings but recovered most of it. I think it's a good product the issue is dorsey is kind of a slacker ceo and they do a ton of stock based comp; yea, I think thank to 30 years since then, US market is more and motr safe. For example, this year we also have t+1 . And it does help me a lot to play safe! t+1 is a huge step up from t+2. A lot of material to teach people to invest/trade/scrap all kind of stuff. US market can only go up. 

Finally, I'm a foreigner! I trust US stock market; Based on what I've seen from your posts, you're ahead of 99% of retail. No need to be modest!; Occasionally I work in my pajamas too.; > back up the truck and load up on quality distressed office buildings on 10x.

Did they give more specific information about that?; Curious if the commentary discusses how valuations of those buildings can be salvaged by the time the maturity wall begins hitting in mid-2025. As much of a bargain the prime areas of real estate are going to be, the loans will assuredly be underwater by the time deal-making is underway. Those millstones will drag the institutional lenders, who were relying on the buildings' mark-to-market values as collateral, down with them.; Issue is, it took waymo a bunch of years to get to this point. And if they get to a point where their integrations are built into purpose made-vehicles, they have a competitive advantage.

&nbsp;
 

plus, if you already have millions of rides in LA/NYC/etc, scaling to other cities is easier (government has tons of ride data to look at). Any new FSD company has to start from scratch building that proof of safety.; Corruption is great isn't it; 20% CAGR in revenue from now into 2027, expanding into high growth sectors, low risk exposure, terribly mispriced by the market due to GAAP standards being hopeless when evaluating business development corporations.; Yes I remember that one week they decided to create new posts every day tagging random people to write an essay critiquing. Probably the most obnoxious behavior in the dailies we have seen.; It’s good for hedging. See it as an insurance. 
But buying verticals and profiting on those is another ballpark.; I think WMS is more drainage focused. CHE owns roto rooter, so actual plumbing repair and service. Slightly different niche.; It is, and they bump against profit caps all the time. It's definitely tough, but CHE does it pretty well.; Yeah, it's been a pretty big trend. I mean there is some great advantages of having the US as your trading partner next to you on the border. 

It's funny because CNBC has actual great reporting around things, outside of their tv shows.

Like this has a 20 minute video around what China is currently doing in Mexico. I know even like AZ, their biggest trading partner is mexico. 

[https://ustr.gov/map/state-benefits](https://ustr.gov/map/state-benefits)

* The state’s largest market was Mexico. Arizona exported $8.0 billion in goods to Mexico in 2023, representing 28 percent of the state’s total goods exports.; it different from Zip afirm. Sezl, you customer have to pay monthly subscription for the service.  i don't use its service, I personally observe the sezzlr subreddit on how people use it.; anyway, the stock is just 2B cap . Compare to AFRM 20B, so you should see the price is at ""40 instead of the real price 400. Low float , have a buy out program of 15M .; A shit sandwich is a sandwich with shit spread inbetween two slices of bread; I genuinely don't know, but slacker how so?; Honestly, I always point out that that I think that's why most of retail fail in general, just people don't want to take the time and energy to do research. I actually view it as a hobby, so I have fun looking into companies and fundamentals and just learning. 

It's cool, because investing as hobby can be low cost, just depending on what you want to actually mess around with capital wise, but you can make money. Like for fun, I created another account to see how far I take 500 bucks and I'm already up to 650 in like two weeks. It's nothing crazy, but basically just made enough for a nice dinner doing nothing really. 

I think being inquisitive is what makes some of the best investors and it's part of why people like Buffet/Munger (RIP) read so much. They are just really inquisitive people. 

Even though I'm a software engineer, I studied sociology and I think just one my nature abilities is to see macro trends. I also just listen to podcasts and informative videos all day when working. 

Appreciatethe kind words!; Haha I'm just teasing! Congrats on getting yourself to a position that many would envy; No, but the CEO does tend to be colorful. The earnings call is a great read if you're interested in the company, or real estate broadly.; They didn't go into the lending aspect as that's less of their business. They do talk about valuations of sold properties getting cut. 

From costar's prospective, they make money on transactions. More sales, even forced sales, are good for business. They offered this as well:

""Users of CoStar now have a comprehensive view of global owners with portfolios greater than 25 properties. CoStar will become even more valuable as the resetting of commercial property values begins to kick in '25 and '26. $930 billion of loans are due in '24 with approximately 30% of this total extended from last year. CMBS delinquency rates remain elevated and office delinquencies have increased notably to 7.7%.

Simultaneously, I believe that there are green shoots in the office market fundamentals that may motivate buyers looking for opportunistic value. As a result, I believe you will see more transactions on 10x in the year ahead.""; yes the problem with waymo is its part of google and doesnt move the stock really, no way to directly invest in it; If you're in on it; Buy calls then.; What do you estimate the fair value of the stock then?; Makes sense. Yeah, it's one of the industrial sectors that I just never got too into since I was more focused on like grid rather than plumbing. Still love when low volume names with low floats buy back a ton of stock. 

To me, that is usually a marker of a great company.; LMAO what a non sequitor i love it; Look at him; From my experience, most retail investors fall into two categories: 

* They treat the stock market as a casino that requires taking huge risk. They endlessly take moonshots hoping to strike it rich instead of accumulating wealth over time. If you treat it like a casino, it will treat you like a sucker at the card table. 
* They assume the stock market is a bank account on steroids and they are owed gains whenever they buy what is trending. Due diligence is a foreign phrase - after all, hasn't the market already chosen winners and losers by democratic vote? If it's not in the Nasdaq 100 or S&P, it doesn't exist. But these investors only do well when the overall market does well. 

It's really neither. At heart investing is a philosophy of pattern recognition and risk management.

> **Even though I'm a software engineer**, I studied sociology and I think just one my nature abilities is to see macro trends.

That gives you a great advantage.

The market is an emergent system made up of different parts continuously interacting over time. When you understand how they influence each other, the reflexivity of agent-based choices, the technical aspects of price movement and crowd behavior, the mechanics of the market's guts, you'll find opportunities to exploit.; Thanks, although I wish clients couldn't call me at 1:00 a.m. - no one deserves that punishment!; It's my favorite. High share price and low volume....I think kits a good long term combo. I hate share splits. If management is worried about options availability it might not be in line with maximum shareholder interest. 

Again, CSU is the model I most appreciate.; I look homeless but I'm a hard worker; If makes you feel better, it's very common with software engineering to have to do oncall duties and you'll be called at like 2am to go fix errors. No job is perfect.; Yeah. I go back to the idea that one thing that is cool about investing, is you can define what you think is a good company. Like some of the best investments I've made have been exactly what you described. Average volume on like IESC is 126,537.; It sucks because 99% of the time, there's no good reason behind it. The client is either panicking due to some TV news or seized by some newfangled idea that has to be discussed **RIGHT NOW** in the middle of the night.; It's the place to be if you don't want to compete against big whales and this find more mispricing.; It's funny because my dad does whole sale annuities and one my best friends is in high end client private banking. 

Lucky for my dad, he deals with mainly like LPL and bankers, so nothing too crazy with dealing with clients. 

Yeah, I feel like having to have soft skills and communication to deal with clients, especially when they are that needy.; Totally, I think you introduced to the concept of fly over names basically. Hope you've been doing well btw!"
247,"What's the take on AAPL's future given Trump victory, Tariffs and Elon gaining more power","What do you think will happen to AAPL?  
I have a high exposure to AAPL and it has served me well. With Apple Intelligence and general trend in tech stocks with AI boost, I still saw some upside and was thinking of holding for longer. But now what Trump won and tariffs are coming, I see Apple products becoming more expensive and taking a hit in sales in the US. 

Also, I feel Elon has had a tiff with Apple in the past with them pulling ads from Twitter/X, Elon trying to launch Tesla Phone and some history with Apple refusing to buy Tesla since Elon had put some shitty condition like he wants to be CEO of Apple as part of the deal.

Do you think Apple will likely see more downside with this Administration or will it likely be more or less the same fate as rest of the Tech stocks? Is Trump Victory ultimately agnostic to Apple's future?",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gm1yta/whats_the_take_on_aapls_future_given_trump/,61,2024-11-07 22:40:52,"We do not produce any phones in the US. 

Just means everyone will have to buy less phones, because everything will be more expensive.; Realistically, I think any large company will simply get exceptions to tariffs via lobbying.

The real concern for me, especially in regards to Apple and really other tech companies is the possible fate of TSMC. Trump is an isolationist at heart and has not committed to defending Taiwan. Personally, I don't think he will when it comes down to it. In any case, an invasion of Taiwan during the next few years would be absolutely catastrophic to the semiconductor industry. Just food for thought.; AAPL will probably go up unless it doesn’t, in that case it more than likely would go down

Edit: That is of course unless it goes sideways instead; I'm in a similar position and really have not thought about the tariffs situation.  I've been holding up for 12 years. Like another post,  expect chaos.  

Maybe Tim Apple will bow and kiss the ring.; Tim Apple?

Tariffs could harm apple products, making things so much more expensive, on top of things ALREADY getting more expensive, so people will neglect buying upgraded iPhones because they need to buy food. 

I trimmed my position.; I spent the last day or so trying to figure out Trump’s position on EVs, and just came across a bunch of articles regarding Elon. 

Elon has 19 different lawsuits across all of his companies. He regularly interacts with the federal government regarding OSHA, vehicle safety, rocket launches, and recently online communication. He has a ton of government contracts. You can sums up his relationship with the government as “it’s complicated.”

He will likely push and pull regulations in a bunch of different ways, on top of the tariffs. A magic orb might give you better clarity than what anyone online can tell you right now. 

Honestly, the only safe choice right now might be index funds - individual stocks may rise and fall so quickly that getting the average result is preferable in times of uncertainty.; Apple moved some of their production out of China and in Trump's first term he excluded apple from tariffs. 

There isn't going to be a Tesla phone, no Tesla bull believes there will be one at least.

I don't own any Aapl as I don't buy apple products. But I don't see anything that would affect the stock negatively.; Apple still has a 'moat'  because apple users aren't focused on price that much.  They aren't going to android or windows, because it costs 20% more.

At least that's been true for last 20 years.    You don't buy apple to save a dollar.  

maybe they won't be as profitable.  or they onshore some production.

TBH, Mexico should benefit the most from a trade war.; Personally I think elons little ""power boost"" is only temporary, man's still dealing with alot of legal bs and the disaster of the cybertruck is gonna cause tesla to TANK the coming year. Plus theirs the recent stories of him  being here illegally and the stories of his illegal drug use. Trump/Republicans will only be able to protect him for so long before elons little empire falls apart; Expect chaos.; They will keep making money; It's gonna go up when you sell and go down when you buy OP!; Elon has directly stated on Joe Rogan last week that they are not discussing launching a phone and have not discussed it previously with the team at Tesla.; If it comes from or made in  China....sell.....US imports in 2023 were close to 1/2 Trillion $$

A 10% or 20% tarrif would be nuts....if just in China....

Trump was taking 10% across the board 

US imports 2023 were 3.2 Trillion 

Would cause huge inflation across the board .....trigger a recession.....

Stupid, Stupid, Stupid....but then...look who said/wants to do it....; Tariff will probably have all sorts of exceptions, Trump is a transactional dude.; If Apple survived Trump’s first term, why they won’t in his second term; On Joe Rogan, Elon said he had no plan to make phones unless Google and Apple started bullying consumers; Anything that hurts Apple will also hurt elons companies. Elon may actually be a great person to be on the inside. As a true billionaire, trump idolizes him.; I think iPhones are about to be $3,000 each if they have to make them in America; Everyone is expecting the tariffs to actually be a thing and I personally think it was just red meat for the base.  Silicone valley will probably benefit tremendously from the de-regulation of the new administration.; Every big company has been red teaming this since the last election, it’s not going to catch anyone by surprise or unprepared. The new reality is government meddling and having to buy off politicians to avoid interference, just like Russia and other quasi-third world countries. It is what it is - free markets and capitalism are out under Trump.; Even if Apple doesn’t grow they’re still printing like $140B in profit each year. Stock buy backs alone will prop the stock up. Any growth is additive to stock appreciation. They’re in a lull at the moment but at some point AI features will be good and fuel an upgrade cycle. They have so much optionality on revenue opps and M&A is now in play.

Cook and Trump also have a great relationship so I’m not too worried about macro risk.; AAPL is one company that you hold forever; I am no expert but all I can say is that Apple is setting itself up to be the next INTC. Insane price tags for their systems. Imagine buying a PC/Laptop these days with 256GB of storage only? in my last 20 years of owning different PC's I have never ever had one with 256GB. Their phones are essentially the same as well. We can clearly see they have no innovation any more.  Unless they do something, I expect them to slowly dip.; Not election related,but Apple has been throwing caution to future sales.

https://m.slashdot.org/story/435099; AI just got a jolt. AAPL will do well; Tesla never tried to launch a phone.  Elon has said they’re not interested in it.  Tim and Elon made up since the scuffle over CEO position.  Last year Tim hosted Elon at Apple HQ; They have more cash than the US; I will buy a new phone soon. It should last 4 years. Or I can just pick up another while I vacation in Thailand.; I see upside to Apple.; I thought APPL was a bank.. is bet 70 billion dollars they can find more revenue; i trimmed my apple position a few days back at $233. it is a range bound this year.; I don’t think Trump will tariff every country and every product and service. I think he’ll target countries with asymmetric tariffs like China. Apple does manufacture in China, but they’ve been working hard to diversify internationally. As long as Trump doesn’t enact tariffs immediately and without warning, Apple should be able to rotate capacity without too many disruptions.; No one in here discusses the other side of the coin. The bigger problem of this stupid tariff is not the US side but the retaliatory tariffs that will be put on US exports to China. Last time, it destroyed US soybean industry, causing more bankruptcy than at any other time in history. What if it's not soybean but iPhone this time, not just tariffs but outright ban iPhone sales in China? I trade with China and, after the last 8 years of trade war, Chinese nationalism is at an all-time high. They are using more and more domestic products (cars, phones, everything). Their BYD is objectively better than Tesla for 1/3rd of the price and Huawei phones are ""3-5 years ahead of Samsung"". 

I don't see any of the rhetoric and trade war is going to help Apple sells more phones in China and/or find any other market to replace it. 

I'm not just selling APPL now, I have a huge Put position based on pure economic outlook. Tell me. If you hold Apple, where is the growth? Where do you make more bucks in this environment? Where are your customers? Right now all I see are downsides.; I think Trump will protect USA companies that aren’t on his black list.; Remember while you argue about tariffs, they are out planning something more nefarious…; Apple is going to be fine. Trump is good for business, not bad. We aren’t going to be tariffing Taiwanese or Vietnamese semiconductors which is their main risk - that would be crazy and Musk isn’t dumb. 

Main issue for Apple is we need AI to drive an upgrade cycle for them. Thus far, the new AI features aren’t cool enough to get everyone upgrading their iPhones. We may get those features next year, announced in June 2025. 

AAPL’s valuation is fine, EPS is growing 15% a year, so expect 15% annual stock returns from Apple until something gets better or worse for them. I think the next step is AI making things better in 2H25.; Don't forget its many american corporations that manufacturer good in china. Trump is not very sophisticated he just says shit to sees what stinks up the whole room .; It's bearish trend now.
Maybe it'll become bullish.
Simple.; it depends what he slaps tariffs on. it isn't a blanket tariff on all imports, or wasn't last time he was president. plus apple has been moving away from china to avoid this already. good chance he just moves completely away from china when this happens.; Now is a good time to unload your AAPL shares - great company but just WAY overvalued. It can't grow revenues fast enough to match that high PE ratio. With AAPL growth rate it should be trading at 12-15 PE.

Then on top of that you have the utter chaos of tRump, with even more power than before. Do you think China will just take a 60% tariff from the USA? No China will place an export Tariff of 60% on products like the Iphone...

Sell high, buy low...; It’ll be great, we’ll assemble phones in America and they’ll cost like, $5 more. People wildly over estimate the assembly costs of electronics. If we have to make all the components here that’ll be tough; Yep. Look at Brazil as an example of tariffs gone wild.; Everyone will go to Mexico to buy phones; Didn't apple build a huge iphone factory in america?; Apple will lose like 50% of its value in the next 4 years if tariffs hit hard.; Or they finally make cheaper phones because most of us don't need $1,000 phones anymore.


[Edit] My point was to lower production costs so they can absorb the tarrifs.; Even if tariffs did increase prices; your $78 monthly phone bill to pay off your new iPhone will now be $89. No one will bat an eye at this unless they’re paying cash for a phone. Yall are blowing this out of proportion

Edit: Make sure to sell off your Apple stock tomorrow morning after downvoting this;  Possible, but not always true. It could also just result in shifts. Phones could get more expensive while tariff income could offset a lower income tax. So in that example people wouldn't spend more. Other taxes would just fall to offset phone tariffs.; > Realistically, I think any large company will simply get exceptions to tariffs via lobbying.

Bingo. Everyone was kissing the ring this week, including Tim Apple.; Isn't that why Biden passed the chip act? Even though I think that Trump will repeal it...; Correct take on what I think will happen with tariffs. I think via exceptions, they are going to be fairly toothless on high value items and might actually become a forcing function to kick start US based manufacturing for smaller, daily items which will help decouple from China.

Dependence on Taiwan is still a major concern for all segments of tech incl Apple. If war breaks out, we'll have bigger things to worry about. 

Whether this works is another story all together but just more perspective over the constant gloom and doom paranoia.; Strongly believe this. One thing Trump won’t fuck with is corporations and their billionaire execs. Those are the people he cares about the most.

Single mother working 2 jobs? Suck on these tariffs.; [deleted]; Won't Apple get hurt in sales in China? Isn't Tesla already hurting there?; > possible fate of TSMC. 

The fate of TSMC is they will become absorbed by the Chinese communist government.  But China will still ship their ICs (they're not giving up that money), so probably not much will change in that regard.

Diminishing returns in phone technology is hitting hard.; But consumers will upgrade less often and buy fewer accessories; Markets love chaos. Right? RIGHT!?!!; Yea. Rogan also talked about how hard it is to break free from the Apple ecosystem. Not saying it’s good for consumers necessarily but Apple has built up a significant moat.; Musk said that there will be some “financial pain”.

I bet money neither of things happen and we’ll all be too distracted with his daily bed-shitting to notice.; ""Silicone valley""... You talking about Los Angeles?; There's likely to be tariffs but they'll be more targeted I think. 

Despite the liberals saying he's trying to destroy the world, he's trying to build the economy up. Tariffs will have the opposite effect if he doesn't slowly phase them in if he does them. 

I don't like that he'll run the economy red hot and risk inflation running away or a debt crisis. To be fair, neither candidate was going to be healthy for those scenarios.; Stock is in a lull? I dunno it’s treated me very well this year; Live in Thailand half time and the other half in the US.

Trump could pull the tariff lever pretty quickly, but how long will it take congress for do tax reform and actually lower income taxes? Would Trump wait a couple of months to let Mike Johnson corral the House?; Which would be interesting because most conservatives I know say that’s one of the few good things Biden did; Yes. It might be repealed but in any case it will take too long to matter anyway if Taiwan is invaded before 28ish. Building those plants is a multi year endeavor.; I expect Trump will take credit for it.; Realistically, could he tariff all goods, which would incentive these companies to manufacture in USA, and then “possibly” offer tax breaks to these companies.  Being manufacturing home, create high income jobs, taxable income, corporate tax, even if it’s at a discount.  We would realize much more gains if they manufactured here.  I’m not taking about the cheap plastic toys china makes.  I’m talking about chips, phones, cars, etc.; In any case larger companies that can afford the necessary ~~bribes~~ lobbying will still be doing better than smaller ones that can't. Better to pay one country's tariff than two. Tariffs have never been good for the consumer but that's what the American consumer voted for, so they will get it.; Pretty sure Taiwan already has plans to blow up TSMC plants of it looks like China is gonna successfully invade.; It's not unlikely that the physical capacity of TSMC will be wiped out during an invasion. Taiwan will fight back, and part of the stick would be denying China a prize like that.; > The fate of TSMC is they will become absorbed by the Chinese communist government. But China will still ship their ICs (they're not giving up that money), so probably not much will change in that regard.

>Of course there is always the good old more government borrowing and lie that somehow tariff money replaced income tax cut.

You have no way of knowing that without knowing the tariff rates and the reduction in income tax. 

I explained to you one example of how tariffs can be offset. Not making a claim specifically as to what will happen here.... The discussion is not about  deficit spending and debt.

You agree that if we put a 1% tariff on imported cell phones and eliminate income tax, then people will have more money to spend on goods and services correct??; not nothing, some will be swayed to just not buy the stuff; How does your statement relate to my comment? I didn't say that they impact the selling country. That said, you are wrong. They can impact the selling country as the other commenter has explained. That's the whole point in many cases... You can ban imports from X country to negatively impact their economy. It's not always effective and not always good but it does have an impact. The impact could be as small as country X having to black market sales through an intermediary country. Or it can be as large as major economic issues; Well of course people would be less likely to buy Chinese made electronics if the price is marked up something fierce.  ; Actually not true. With the factories moving away many people become unemployed without decent social benefits and thus have no spending power. Coupling with our housing bubble crisis, everything is cheap but workers and businesses are bleeding. And people report not being paid or not being paid on time.; So let's say we eliminate income taxes and impose a 1% tariff on cell phone imports. Will the average person be able to buy more or less phones?; What do you think would happen  if we put a 1% tariff on imported cell phones and eliminate income taxes?; Agreed. I'm not claiming it's a good or quick idea, but it is something he has discussed if I remember correctly.

 I guess he could also attempt similar solutions like student debt relief. He could attempt something like simple debt relief where you are eligible for debt relief proportionally to your income tax debt. 

I'm getting tons of downvotes on this, probably because people don't like trump. I'm not claiming here that tariffs are good or bad. Hell, Biden has had them as well...; Should really watch ‘American factory’ on Netflix. I’ve been on manufacturing lines in China, no way an American would ever work a 12 hr shift 6 days a week. Only if automation does 90% of the work then maybe it’s feasible, assuming the last 10% doesn’t unionize first.; > I’m talking about chips, phones, cars, etc.  

You do realize there are car manufacturing plants already in the U.S., right?  Besides Ford and GM, Japanese and German companies have plants in the U.S.    If trump decides to tax them on cars they don't make in the U.S., they just might pull all their manufacturing out of the U.S., as a retaliatory measure.   What are those workers   going to do then?

That might not be an option for those engineers, etc.  The brutality of the Chinese communist regime can be pretty motivating.

I honestly hope you’re trolling and aren’t this stupid.; >eliminate income taxes and impose a 1% tariff 

Why use a scenario that's probably not going to happen lol?  Wasn't Trump talking about a blanket 20% tariff, and even higher for certain products from China?  I'll use an extreme (but more likely) example to counter your extreme (but unlikely) example.

The reason it's regressive is... imagine you're in rural Florida, you and your married partner are making $29k combined.  Under current tax laws, you're paying zero federal income tax, and paying pretty much no tariffs when compared to Trump's plan.

Now imagine you guys are making the same amount under Trump. He eliminates the federal income tax (which doesn't affect you because your income tax bill was zero before this anyway), and increases tariffs (to a more realistic) 10-20%.  What happens to your purchasing power?  Even at your unrealistic example of 1% tariff, your money would buy you less.  

Edited for clarity; We would balloon the deficit to crazy levels and wreck the global economy; car assembly plants. They don’t manufacture, they assemble.

  
Yes, i buy a phone every 4 years, i am okay with that.; I’m implying that ASML EUV machines are only possible through a global effort, parts break, and it would not be feasible to continue the use without the expertise and continued collaboration of the manufacturer.

ASML sources specific parts of the machine from multiple countries.; https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.instagram.com/jeffbezos/p/CHTZ-TyHqjN/&ved=2ahUKEwj_9pD8wcuJAxUCJUQIHcRuAzEQFnoECBcQAQ&usg=AOvVaw306MFrqUNLlgJh9687Z-GP; You can't break the physics of antennas nor is some radical advancement likely that would permit the necessary device density. Which binds them to more conventional tech, and Musk has little chance of breaking into the phone market without something revolutionary.; Honestly forgot that was even an option. What is the typical cost saving for purchasing the phone outright as opposed to paying for it monthly in the plan?; How do you know he will this time? It’s all about how to get best deal. You think he wants to crush an American company?; Fair enough and I hope so too, no one should want everything to burn just because they don’t like the guy.; seriously 🤦🏿 ; Who said I voted for him. Don’t be so butt hurt; It is literally literally the most “economics” to say:

“if I tax you a ton of money for doing this specific thing (e.g. assembling electronics overseas), you’ll figure out how to avoid the tax, unless the cost of avoiding it is more than the tax itself”. 🤷‍♀️; Primarily non-US companies but in the USA. LG & Samsung appliances are mostly made here for example. GE also I believe.; Ummm… there are no tariffs right now?; E bay about to flourish; The original iPhone was $700 when it was released. I don’t hear anyone complaining about todays prices; Not much. I'm giving an exaggerated example to demonstrate the point that it is possible; You don't want to answer because my extreme example demonstrates the point. You would be able to buy more phones...

It could be a 10% tariff on phones and a 10% reduction on income tax. If you spend trice as much on income tax than you do on phones, then you would still be able to buy more phones... Maybe the income tax reduction comes from no more wasteful spending and a reduction of interest rates lowering debt service. Or what example you want...; ""Why use a scenario that's probably not going to happen lol?""

Because using an extreme example makes the point more obvious.  I'm not saying it will happen.  Simply that it is possible. I'm also pretty sure Trump has mentioned Tariffs and elimination on income tax.  Don't think that will happen of course.

  
In response to your example, I agree that sales taxes, tariffs on goods, etc... are generally regressive.  Lower income pay a larger portion relative to their wealth.  Your median US household does pay income tax though.  So your median American still could benefit from lower income tax and tariffs.  

Once again, I'm not suggesting tariffs are always a good thing.  They have a time and place.  I'm not saying they are necessarily the solution here.  Simply- it's possible to raise a tariff on a specific good and still enable consumers to purchase more of it by offsetting the tariff with other tax reductions.; OMG... You are still missing the point. The same levers apply in less extreme examples...; You just don't seem to get it.... You can tax a specific good more and still enable people to purchase more of it by lowering their overall tax burden more. Why don't you understand this?; >car assembly plants. They don’t manufacture, they assemble.  

Semantics.  Assembling piece parts into an entire product is manufacturing.   Ok, regardless, foreign companies pull those assembly plants from the U.S.  I'm sure the people out of work will be comforted to know what you define as manufacturing.

>Yes, i buy a phone every 4 years, i am okay with that.  

Ok. Most Americans are not.  They got used to their cheap Chinese electronics.  Tripling the price on these will cause a revolt, which maybe is a good thing.  And don't say, ""well, we will just make them in the U.S.""  You don't set up a large electronics manufacturing line up overnight.  And there are only a few PCB vendors left in the U.S. High-volume PCB fab is done in China.; I worked for a Toyota plant in the US.


The inputs were American steel in big rolls and cast metal blocks from American foundries. The dimensions for the steel was even in Freedom Units. These were cut and stamped into car parts onsite. The engines were bored out, milled, had some of their gears cut, all onsite (others supplied by usually Japanese companies, but often also actually made in the US).


I worked in the Body Weld department, between stamping and paint. Stamping was where the long steel rolls would stop looking like big rolls of toilet paper and start looking like car doors and wheel wells. In Body Weld the actual parts get assembled and welded by robots into an actual car body. Paint was then where the parts got painted to their final color and to avoid rust. 


After that all the interior fitting out happened, again with usually Japanese companies manufacturing seats, infotainment systems with a mix of origin countries. 


When you start with raw steel and aluminum and end with a car... my friend, I'd say that's bona fide manufacturing (...and then also assembly).; Ok.  Sorry, I'm still trying to read between the lines here.  

So are you saying, in the event China takes over Taiwan, and hence TSMC, companies like ASML will refuse to do business with China?  ASML will take a moral stand over profit, and not provide new equipment or support for old equipment?  

If so, you have a much rosier view of corporate thinking than I do.; Interesting, the news said yesterday he didn’t but clearly he did.; You're right. Trump lies like a fish breathes water. Maybe he'll never enact those tariffs.; So, you think tariffs drive prices down for manufacturers? Gurl, you're not an economics major of any sort (and you also edited your post because you knew how wrong it was and tagged manufacturing in); I’m mostly familiar with fridges and washing machines.; No, you wouldn’t because your money would have to go towards other things. Car maintenance because your roads and highways will be fucked up. Healthcare because you’d have to pay for all your expenses out of pocket.  I don’t think you realize what your income taxes go towards. Oh right and you’d still end up paying more for other goods because of the tariffs too.; >Your median US household does pay income tax though. So your median American still could benefit from lower income tax and tariffs.

The bottom half will probably be paying more if we do get universal tariffs.  With tariffs in the 20% range, even if you make the median household income, you're probably going to pay more.  If you're single and making \~$60k, your effective federal tax rate currently is lower than 10%.  If Trump tariffs are 20%, what he says he wants them at, I have no doubt you're going to be paying more, even if federal taxes get eliminated.

Now, if you're making $500k a year, your effective federal tax rate currently might be somewhere around 28%, and with 20% tariffs and elimination of federal taxes, you could be paying less overall.  But let's be honest, are these the type of people that really need help right now?

Not to mention, the other countries will probably enact their own tariffs in retaliation, as we've seen from the last time he was in office.  Remember when US farmers were struggling because China pulled back from buying US farmed goods, and Trump had to give farmers billions of dollars in aid?  Typically, before Trump tariffs, we gave farmers around $10 billion a year.  In 2019 and 2020, it was \~$23 billion and \~$32 billion respectively.

All I hope is, someone educated will be advising him not to do 10-20% universal tariffs and elimination of federal taxes, because median income earners and below will be worse off, and US debt will balloon.

>Simply- it's possible to raise a tariff on a specific good and still enable consumers to purchase more of it by offsetting the tariff with other tax reductions.

I'm basing what I'm saying on what Trump is saying.  I'm not sure why you keep spinning what he says to fit your narrative.  Where did he say he's only doing tariffs on specific goods?  Personally, I'd be fine with reasonable targeted tariffs, but Trump is saying 10-20% universal tariffs and even higher for specific goods from China.  Biden raised tariffs on Chinese cars in order to protect US automakers/workers.  If it's specific and targeted, I don't have a huge issue with it, but that's not what Trump is saying...; I think you're the one that doesn't get it; That's pretty cool.  But how long ago did you work for this Toyota plant?  Just curious.   

Because with U.S. Steel on the auction block, I wonder about domestically sourced steel.  Maybe the Japanese company that wanted to buy them might keep the steel mills in the U.S. open.  But if that sale gets blocked, unless Trump wants to spend taxpayer money to keep them afloat, they're just going to shutter.    

As for the rest, I'm not surprised that the machining operations were done onsite.  I've seen some pretty impressive machining techniques.  Ironic, though, that a Japanese company would do those operations in the U.S., while U.S. car companies probably do them in Mexico.; They will not sell EUV machines to China now and they are ending supply and maintenance of DUV machines to China when those contracts expire.  I don’t think it’s far fetched to say they would not work with China on a Taiwan invasion.; I'm beginning to think he's just going to cut corporate taxes then go play golf for four years.; It’s literally exactly the same text - my phone point was about assembly from the get go?; [deleted]; GE sold their appliance line to Haier about 10 years ago.; Here’s a great article on US made washing machines from industry week 

https://www.industryweek.com/the-economy/trade/article/21280717/washing-machine-tariffs-come-out-clean-sparkling-for-us-manufacturing; We can play these silly games if you want. 

Fine. You mistakenly assume that the money is already being spent perfectly efficiency but it's not. The lower tax collections force government to spend it's money more efficiently and we end up with the same service at lower cost. We get rid of bloated contracts. We fire the useless workers.

Or the tariff causes the profitability of domestically manufactured phones to rise. This leads to the production of cheaper US phones and an increase in tax revenue due to additional corporate tax income.

I understand where my income taxes go to. More gos to debt service at a national level than to roads...; >The bottom half will probably be paying more if we do get universal tariffs. With tariffs in the 20% range, even if you make the median household income, you're probably going to pay more.

There is no way to know any of this until we know what new tariff and tax policy is. Tariffs are a tool in the toolbox. Sometimes the correct tool, other times not.


>All I hope is, someone educated will be advising him not to do 10-20% universal tariffs and elimination of federal taxes, because median income earners and below will be worse off, and US debt will balloon

I hope so as well 

>I'm basing what I'm saying on what Trump is saying. I'm not sure why you keep spinning what he says to fit your narrative. Where did he say he's only doing tariffs on specific goods?

What are you talking about? I'm not trying to fit anything Trump says to any narrative. 

I have been saying the same thing over and over- You can raise a tariff on a specific good and still enable the population to purchase more of it by offset the cost elsewhere.  

My point was not about Trump or Biden. I agree targeting tariffs are generally a better policy.; So you believe any time tax on a specific product increases, then you will have to buy less regardless of external factors? 

If this year they add a 2 cent tax per bottle of wine, but they give me back an extra $2000 tax refund. Can I buy more or less wine than last year?; If so, that is good.  I am genuinely curious - do have some source talking about ASML not selling to China?; The whole point of tariffs is to create a specific economic incentive- to incentivize on-shoring. If that’s a moral good there’s nothing intrinsically wrong with that incentive. 

We give intellectual property rights on drugs to pharmaceutical companies to incentivize R&D, even though it drives up consumer prices on drugs. The idea there is even though we pay more for drugs, less people die gruesome deaths. Ultimately it’s a moral question.; I believe Hotpoint is still owned by them. https://products.geappliances.com/appliance/gea-support-search-content?contentId=19027#:~:text=GE%20Appliances%20sells%20Hotpoint%20products,Whirlpool%20Support; I agree the money isn’t spent perfectly and that the wrong people are the ones being taxed the most, but to think that somehow lowering the amount of money that is being given to the states and federal government would somehow make services stay the same functionality wise and cheaper at that is just illogical. I really have no idea where you are getting your ideologies from but I hope you refrain from going back to those sites and people because you are hopelessly misinformed.; I agree mostly with everything you said.  

>What are you talking about? I'm not trying to fit anything Trump says to any narrative.

I just didn't understand why you're bringing up **targeted and specific tariffs** in the context of Trump when he proposed **universal 10-20% tariffs**.  That's all.

>President-elect Trump has promised to impose steep new taxes on trade, including a 10-20 percent tariff on all imports, at least a 60 percent tariff on Chinese imports, and a 25-100 percent tariff on Mexican imports.

From [taxfoundation](https://taxfoundation.org/blog/trump-tariffs-impact-economy/), a center-right website.; The problem with your analogy is they will never give you $2000 back. Have you not checked the debt clock in a while? Only a clown would honestly believe any of these jokes of a tax proposal would ever pass.; https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/dutch-govt-to-stop-asml-from-maintaining-lithography-gear-bought-by-chinese-customers/

https://www.ft.com/content/a736beeb-b38a-484e-bbe9-98e92ecb66d9; Tariffs reduce demands for imports (because of higher price in a country) and discourage exports (because of retaliation tariffs). What you're suggesting is something that might happen in positive in scope in 8 - 10 year time scale. I didn't meme you, I'm challenging your ridiculous assertion. The International Monetary Fund suggests 10% tariffs would decrease GDP by a percentage point alone and that's without retaliation. So who do I believe you / Trump or an global economic institution with thousands of economists?; GEA is a subsidiary of Haier. 

GE broke into 3 companies- GE Aerospace, GE Healthcare and GE Vernova.; You still miss the point I've been trying to make from the beginning. You can tax a specific good and still enable people to purchase more of it by lowering their overall tax burden even more than the specific good tax.; Time will tell. I'm not 100% confident that he will go that hard on tariffs, but it's possible; They literally do it all the time, and it's entirely possible.

Of course they can do it and add to the out of control debt. Is it a good idea? No. Can it be done? Of course it can. Don't be ridiculous.; Oh he’s for sure a fool on this. My assumption is they will probably institute so much more carefully designed incentives. If they do what they say, they’re gonna do it’ll be a catastrophe. In general, it’s pretty easy to prove that free trade improves economic surplus meeting to say that prioritizing domestic factory literally makes people in aggregate more poor. 

It seems to me that the goal here is to redistribute wealth to a certain constituency who wants these kinds of blue-collar manufacturing jobs. There is a world where protectionist policies can legitimately help those blue-collar working people, which I think is a good thing.; Yeah they were a client of the place I worked. Baker Hughes I think was spun out before as well. Regardless of the corporate structure, I believe their manufacturing is in Kentucky somewhere"
248,Globalstar Smashes Earnings with a 19.5% Revenue Beat! $GSAT 🚀,"

249,ASML: Why I am giving up on the stock (for the short term),"ASML is a Netherlands based manufacturer of advanced semiconductor equipment systems. The company enjoys a wide moat as currently this is only company which can manufacture equipments to produce latest 3 NM AI chips.

ASML counts TSM, Samsung, SK Hynix, Intel and others as its customers.

However, demand for non AI semiconductor equipment systems has dropped significantly which prompted ASML to give lower guidance for the next quarter.

The stock was savagely beateb down and fell from 800+€ to 610€ at yesterday's closing.

Why I have given him on hope of revival of ASML fortunes in the short term?

Except for high end AI chips, rest of the chip industry is struggling to increase sales revenue and profits. In absence of increase in sales, the demand for new non-AI chip producing equipments will be very slow.

Only a sliver of the semi conductor industry [that includes NVDA] has order book full for next rwo quarters. But that demand may also taper in by mid 2025 as likes of Meta, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Tesla etc have their data centers and LLMs ready by then.

In absense of new demand for non-AI chips and expected slow down in AI chips, it is unlikely any foundary will place new orders for the ASML equipment [each machine is said to cost between 100 M$-300M$].

Revival in the fortunes of ASML depends on breakthrough in new chip designs which will make it neccessary to spend on new equipments. But that breakthrough may take a year or more [yes, it takes time to discover/invent new technologies & designs with sufficient advantage that merits an upgrade].

ASML stock fell below important psychological resistance of 618 € yesterday, while US tech sector roared to new heights. This weakness is fortunes of ASML is telling and may lead to further drop in price in coming days.

While ASML remains a strong company with a wide moat, but in the current cycle of the semi conductor industry it is unlikely to post strong results.

How to trade?

Buy 580 € PUTs with December 20th expiry.

Happy Trading!

[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse); They're a monopoly, even in short term drop, long term they will rise since AI chips will also use 3nm and below architecture, not to mention chiplets (die-to-die) which will make it even more lucrative and in demand for super accurate and pinpoint lithography; I’m extremely mad at myself that I didn’t sell at $900+ it was at. Greed is a bitch I guess.; TSMC just got billions awarded from the government to build factories in the US. Those factories gotta be stocked. And Nvidia just anounced, they are going to [enter the CPU race](https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-make-arm-based-pc-chips-major-new-challenge-intel-2023-10-23/). Plus as already was stated by others they have basically a monopoly. And while the threat of a chinese invasion is somewhat holding TSMC down, having ASML hedges against that, because new factories would have to be set up in the west in no time. And make no mistake: I don´t know, if Trump would help Taiwan during an invasion, but he would surely have some Cruise MIssiles ready to insure, Beijing won´t capture any TSMC factories.

ASML got caught in some jitters but within the Semi stocks, it´s p/e ratio is pretty moderate. I am not a big investor, but I bought a chip of ASML on the dip and see no reason to throw it away. And just so we´re clear: The drop of ASML was weeks ago after earnings. Until the election ASML has already recovered some of that. 

Then again: I am just another hollow voice on the internet.; [deleted]; Didn't read, bought calls.; I’d given up on it too if I didn’t have bags already down at almost 18%. Now I’m “long term investor” in this crap. Had a hunch on selling and putting into COIN yesterday, but got too busy and was late.; Got any feelings on Lam Research? LRCX; I read this all and decided to buy calls.; Asml is on sale at this point. Also they are on a massive cost reduction hunt. Pretty good because they where throwing money everywhere.; If your monopoly position hurts your growth with restrictions and tariffs which hurt your stock and shareholder value - then what’s the point in it? I’d argue being generalist with better offer is far safer in business than monopoly.; ASML produces high-end Lithography machines. Lithography is just one part of the extremely complex process of Chip production. These high-end machines are used in very few places on earth. So even though ASML is a qvasi-monopoly, the market is small and exposed to geopolitical risk (e.g. they were forbidden to sell stuff to China).; The company's fundamentals are still strong but it now caught in a downward cycle which may last several months/quarter. 
If you can hold long enough then you may still come on top.; My bearish view on ASML is just short term. Yes, any new chip factory needs to stocked with latest gizmos & gadgets from ASML, but that may not be enough (in the short term) to excite the investors.

For the long term, however, ASML is a buy and a must have in the portfolio of any serious (retail) investor.; Trump's gonna hit China right in the economics if they dare touch Taiwan https://x.com/RpsAgainstTrump/status/1848378313678455249; Yes, the announcement was made a week back.

But the order book of ASML still remains thin to justify much higher price of stock or a higher PE [current is at 32].

Of course, if ASML can bag more orders then the stock can easily come back to life.; This stock cannot even stay above its 20 DMA. It is in the grip of a powerful bear.

But all the best, if you do buy Calls.; Be mindful, stock is testing support at 618 € and if it is breached then next support level is around 550 €.
But if you can hold, then you should. But it may take a while before this stock makes a big & sustained move upwards.; Probably will do far better because US-based.; I havent studied the stock so cannot comment.; All the best!; The products they sell are tremendously great and will help companies make vast improvements in chip production, but when machines cost over $300 million dollars each there is a limited market of customers and slow production and sales time. Still a good company but you have to know how the fundamentals of a company work including product sales, pricing and order flow.; Hilarious that 3+ months is now considered a long hold; I can, I’ve  wanted this to be a long play since it’s a monopoly. It’s just ironic because this stock saved my portfolio at one point and now everything else is super green but this is dragging it down.

I think 1/3 of what I have was bought when it $400-$500 and I bought heavily at $700 thinking that was the discount after what two years of initial purchase.; Do you think that ASML go all the way to 550€?

It's currently sitting at the 200MA on a weekly basis which has historically been a strong support level.

I hope we've bottomed here, but if it'll go lower, it's time to load up more shares.; I’m at a loss anyways, so more loss from this point is probably not gonna influence my bagholding much. I’m wondering if the new beancounter CEO will say something again next week during Investor Day that will push the stock down further. 550 and down looks feasible. Worst stock pick I did this year by far.; No, I only said that once 618 € support is breached then next support level is at 550 €. Not a certainty, but a high probability.; Hi, following up on your previous comment regarding the 618€ support. How did you determine this as a support level?

I'd like to understand your TA a little bit better. The 550€ - I know which low you are referring to.

Thank you,; Support & Resistance levels may be done manually or through a model by employing any one or combination of the following: 

1) Peak and Troughs on the chart: Levels at which a stock peaked serves as a resistance while levels at which a stock hit the trough and bounced back serves as a support.
2) Moving Averages: Following moving averages are considered important: 20 days MA [short term], 50 days MA [medium term], and 200 days MA [long term]. If the stock is above the certain moving average, then it may  serve as a support and vice-versa.
3) Trend Lines: often a stock may be trending up or down in a non linear fashion on a long time scale [this may be easy to miss if you are only looking at short time scale charts]. Parallel lines drown along the peaks & troughs as the stock moves over a period of time may indicate support and resistance.; I do understand how support and resistance lines are formed. I just don't see where you have a resistance at 618€ :)
