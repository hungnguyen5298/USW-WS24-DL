Taiwan's Foxconn (2317.TW), opens new tab, the world's largest contract electronics maker, beat expectations to post its highest-ever revenue for the fourth quarter on continued strong demand for artificial intelligence (AI) servers.


Revenue for Apple's biggest iPhone assembler jumped 15.2% to T$2.13 trillion ($64.72 billion), Foxconn said in a statement on Sunday.


It was also ahead of a T$2.1 trillion LSEG SmartEstimate, which gives greater weight to forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurat

Robust AI server demand led to strong revenue growth for its cloud and networking products division, said Foxconn, whose customers include AI chip firm Nvidia.


For smart consumer electronics, which includes iPhones, there was ""roughly flattish"" year-on-year growth, it said.


Total revenue in December alone reached T$654.8 billion, up 42.3% year on year and the second-highest ever level for the month.

In the first quarter of 2025, overall operations have gradually entered the traditional off-season,"" Foxconn said of its outlook for the current quarter.


""Even with record high revenue in the fourth quarter of 2024, the sequential performance of the first quarter will reach roughly similar levels that are average to the past five years; compared with a year ago, it should show significant growth.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1huxyay/nvidia_supplier_foxconn_reports_record_quarter/,103,2025-01-06 13:32:03,Foxconn killing it with that AI server demand!; This is good. Thanx; Wouldn't Apple be a bigger factor in all this good news about Foxconn?; That wouldn't get as many clicks 
Why is trading working out for me? I need advice to be better/improve,"No I don’t mean one of those people who  just started trading 6 months ago and gambled 80% of my money on penny stocked and options and made $10k

I’ve been “trading” for 4 years. I’m not an expert by any means. But I’m actually doing pretty well and I just wanna stay humble because once you start getting too confident, you start messing up.

I started by dabbling around with a few stocks like Tesla and apple. Then I discovered bitcoin. Slowly got into that and admittedly made most of my money from bitcoin. I worked my ass off investing a lot of my money into bitcoin. THEN I got into stocks. I also got more comfortable with doge coin. 

I started very little. Making $10-$80 swing trade gains. Getting used to the feeling of losses. Researching stocks. Learning to not panic and try to make my money back when I lose some money.

As of now, most of my money is in bitcoin and I’m okay with that. I’ve also played with doge, but I stayed really patient. Was down $7k and just waited it out. It was very discouraging. But I stayed patient and I made so much money from bitcoin and doge coin. I started playing with options and thankfully did not get caught up into gambling and losing my money. 

BUT, I started getting more and more into stocks. Researching companies, especially AI industry. So I am not stupid  enough to just put 80% of my money in penny stocks.y net worst is $120k I am 24 years old. And I’ve been investing / swing trading penny stocks such as BBAI, SERV, KULR, SOUN and also some NVDA along with holding my bitcoin and holding/selling my dogecoin. I am not investing/trading  these stocks because of hype only. But also because of the company having potential. I only put $10k max into stocks. 

I’ve learned to manage my risk by researching companies especially with CHATGPT. Thinking more before taking a loss or gain. Not putting my self in a position to panic. For example, if bitcoin crashes, it’ll hurt but I won’t panic because even though I have a LOT in bitcoin , I believe in it. If doge crashes, it’ll hurt a lot but I didn’t put all my money. I might panic a little tbh though lol. With the stocks, especially penny stocks, even if they all crashed, it will hurt a lot but I won’t panic because I put less than 10% in stocks, I researched the stocks, and I diversified my portfolio 

I’ve been making better gains. I’m not a good trader. But I’ve been taking it slow with stocks. My gains/losses for the past 14 months at $6700 gains and $3500 losses. But I’ve gotten better at making more profit. Now I have made more around $100 to $1500 profit and got used to losing money. I don’t use stop losses because I don’t invest enough money to need to panic if they crash. But essentially, I’ve just learned to not panic and to not put my self in a position to panic and I’ve learned to do more research. I’ve learned to handle losses, be patient, and balance patience, and learning when to take a loss or gain.

I don’t have a handbook or anything. But my “skill” seems to be like it’s just intuition at this point which makes me very uncomfortable because it feels like I’m lying to my self and will fail soon. All I can say is that I’ve learned to not risk all my money in one place(aside bitcoin lol), understand how much I can put and handle losing without losing my mind, diversifying, researching, BEING PATIENT, thinking before taking a loss or gain, learn from mistakes of any losses, not be crazy and try to make all my money back if I lost any, take it slow until my intuition and skills gets better (that’s why my net profit is $3000 past 14 months from stocks), and NOT GAMBLE WITH OPTIONS!!!!!! 

I’d often look and just wonder how in the world people lose 90% of their money and it turns out it’s just gambling most your money in risky stocks, options, penny stocks etc and just trying to get rich quick

I’m 24, 120k$ net worth, wanna start a business, wanna get better at trading. I’m lowkey clueless in a way. I feel “smart” because I’ve made money but I’m not smart at all which is why I am asking for advice on how to be an actual successful trader based on my current experience ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1hux5v3/why_is_trading_working_out_for_me_i_need_advice/,0,2025-01-06 12:43:26,"It’s great that you’re profitable, what’s your strategy based around? What indicators are you using?; focus on consistency not big wins keep learning and refining your strategy stay disciplined manage risk and avoid overconfidence patience is key and always be willing to adapt and learn if u are considering automating trade pickmytrade bridges tradingview with rithmic and tradovate for futures trading; [removed]; Yeah I mean I see a lot of this whole “fix your strategy” stuff and I don’t understand what people mean. Like is there a specific strategy to follow? Also I feel like since I’ve made it far enough to make profit, I can handle losses better know I did something right. Eventually I wanna have 50% of my money in safe long term index fund so even if I lose , I used my profit for safely invest and grow it.

However, I never know when to sell a stock. I guess greed is an issue but this is the part that I get confused on. I made $1200 from SOUN when I sold. But then, I bought back in anyways. When do I let a stock go completely?"
Mag7 - Personal experiment 2024,"**Hi everyone!**

In 2024, I decided to try a simple but consistent investment experiment: I invested **€10 per week** in the ""Magnificent 7"" (MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, NVDA, TSLA, and META). The goal was to understand how regularity and patience could yield results. I confess that I rebalanced twice, but I can’t remember when exactly (oops!).

This wasn’t my only investment, and its sole purpose was to see how it would perform over the course of a year. It’s not an allocation I plan to keep in the future.

**Results**:

* I invested a total of **€520** throughout the year.
* The current portfolio value is **€706.80**, which means a profit of **€186.80** (+35.92% return).

**Key Takeaways**:

* **Consistency works:** Investing small amounts regularly helps avoid timing the market. DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) for the win!
* **Stock selection matters:** The ""Magnificent 7"" are heavily exposed to the tech sector, which had a strong year, but that also means higher volatility.
* **Patience is key:** I didn’t touch the investments throughout the year, and that was crucial for these results.

This was a personal experiment that helped me learn more about the impact of regular investing and how the market can reward those who stick to a disciplined strategy.

It’s just my experience—not right, not wrong—just mine, and I wanted to share it with you!

**Discussion**:  
Has anyone else here tried investment ""experiments"" like this? How did it go for you?

mad sarcasm aside, im happy for your returns and that you stuck to your plan! :); Stupid question: can you buy part of shares on all platforms? It doesn't seem possible on the platform I use. For me I thought I had to always buy at least 1 share.; yes Direct Indexing can be more beneficial than buying an actual index that gets dragged down by 'looser' stocks; No rule, just do it!; no, depends where you are but usually the majority of brokers nowadays allows part-buying; Adding to what the other person said, I would avoid partial shares personally when possible. Although it's not really a big deal either way. Just weird with voting rights and actual ownership of the shares."
Insight for Down Payment on a Home,"Hello, new to this whole investing thing. I’m (22M) looking for some advice on what I should invest in order to make a 25k or more down payment for a home within the next 4-5 years.

Some factors to consider is I don’t make much, around 25k net pay. As part of the Military, I don’t have any expenses besides a car loan that will be paid off in 8 months, necessities including food, and installments on a new laptop, phone bill, Matco loan, and total brings me to around $804 a month.

I had been living paycheck to paycheck for some time so never had time to even consider putting money else where when I needed every penny. Currently have 1500 to my name. After this month, I will finally be stable and able to allocate my earnings.

Now back to the topic at hand. What stock(s), bond(s), ETF(s), cryptos, are recommended? I can spare $450 each month to savings or investments. Any other advice is appreciated.

I use Robinhood and Betterment.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1huoszu/insight_for_down_payment_on_a_home/,0,2025-01-06 03:45:01,"Saving for a house, a HYSA is probably your best bet.  Dear god, say NO to crypto. 

If your finances are as tight as you describe, be ready to save up for a while or increase your income.; You expect to be able to buy a home on a $25k per year salary? When you can't even afford to pay cash for just a laptop? When you only have $1,500  in total savings?When you're living paycheck to paycheck?

Houses are expensive, and you have no emergency fund for it or anything else. Your first priority needs to be saving whatever money you can for your emergency fund. Then, after a minimum of 6 months worth of expenses saved in a HYSA, then you can turn your attention to savings money for a house. That money will also need to be put into a HYSA so the money will still be there when you're finally able to afford a house.; Congrats on getting to a point of some financial stability! That's gotta feel great, dude.

Now that you're in this position, if I had to guess, the last thing you'd want to do is piss your money away on a gamble - is that fair? If so... I'd steer clear of the crypto stuff.

Down payment on a home in 4-5 years. That's not far off. It's entirely possible that in that short amount of time, the stock market can take a dive and you might be down on your investment 20%, 30%, however much. But, it also has a lot of potential upside for gain. There's a risk/reward tradeoff there.

The safest and surest bet for something not far on the horizon is some sort of high-yield savings account or similar.; Your still young, would recommend to first concentrate on retirement savings and investments, 401k until match (tsp plan in army) max your Roth IRA, 

What you want to do is setup a stable future for your self and that starts by investing, once you’ve done this for the next 5-10 years, or once you retire from the army then you can take a VA loan with low interest rates to buy a house; I’d stay away from stocks for now and instead build an emergency fund. That fund should be able to cover months of emergency expenses. You can keep that fund in a high yield savings account so it can earn a bit of interest while it’s there. Once that is done, you can look at investing. 

Realistically, most Americans don’t buy their first home until they are in their 30s. The average age currently sits at [38.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/buying-a-house-first-time-homebuyer/) That being said, what you’re aiming for is very unrealistic. The average home price is well above $300,000. 

I’d slow down and figure out how much it costs to own a home in your area. This isn’t just the mortgage but all of the expenses that go along with it such as: electric bill, internet bill, maintenance expenses, lawn care, etc. 

Homes are expensive and they cost much more than just the mortgage payment. Good luck to you. You’re going in the right direction.; Since you are still young, why not invest in yourself first.  Go to school and learn some skills that will land you on a high paying career.

That’s the best investment you can do.  Learn some trade or go to medical field.  Anything to upgrade yourself.  Good luck!; Put what you can each week into a total market/S&P index fund. Even if it’s $50, in 5 years I bet you are close to 20k.; Absolutely. I’m making use of the 50/30/20 rule and budgeting where I need to. Although since I only pay 804 a month, I have some extra income I can place towards savings.; I agree with this guy, you are far off of being able to afford a house.
Mind you i said afford, not buy.


You need to increase your income and save more money and for more years.


If you go all in on a house with 0 money in the back, your future is doomed and you become ""housebroke""; My position is obvious and I don’t need to go over it again. There’s some benefit that I will get later on that will help my situation. By 6 months I will have had enough saved for back-up, in 6 months I will have paid off certain things, so they are no longer a factor. When these next 3 year go buy, my pay will have increase another 5k. I’m going to college and army is paying it along with grants. My education is basically free. I will have earned an associates and considerably more money before I have left. I will also be doing side work (photographing and auto repair) so I may earn more income. 

I’m remaining realistically optimistic, but overall, your input is appreciated. I just wanted more guidance.; Could I use Robin Hood as my bank since they offer 4.5% HYSA and still invest some? I understand you’re coming from a helping place.; Currently contributing to TSP, A Roth IRA, and now investments. Better said than done, but not letting any opportunity slip through. It’s obvious that I have to make an emergency fund, contribute to my TSP, and ensure I will be stable. I just wanted more guidance in the right direction.; Thank you very much. This is more info I needed. Gonna try to save and invest. I will have some side jobs going on and that money will build my savings.; Applied for college. I’m a helicopter mechanic in the army so going into an aviation related field for my studies. Further education and certifications are my goal so that I MAY increase my money and still invest, save, and purchase when the time arrives. I will have made substantially more money in the next couple years once I get my associates. Other benefits as well.; Basically if you did that $50 a week into an SP fund the last 5 years (up 83% in that time) you would be at 17k.; Can I have a simple breakdown of what that is? Not investment savvy yet.; Robinhood requires you to subscribe to Robinhood Gold ($5 a month) for the APY and it is now 4%, not 4.5% anymore. Instead of Robinhood, you can switch to Fidelity where any uninvested money gets swept into Fidelity's money market fund ""SPAXX"" (currently ~4%)for free without any subscription. I use SPAXX as my HYSA. You can also buy short-term U.S. bonds on Fidelity where the interest gains are tax-exempt from local and state taxes (only pay federal tax). The only problem with Fidelity is that their IU sucks compared to Robinhood, but you can always do your investing on Fidelity and use Robinhood for daily stock viewing like me.; Keep at it, just keep the house plan on hold until you retire; Look up Vanguard for a good self managed brokerage account. Low to no fees. An S&P index fund is one that mirrors the S&P 500 companies so you are invested in many of the top companies. VOO is vanguards fund you can research more from there for what works for you.; This is genuinely very helpful advice. Thank you very much! I’ll look into this.; Thank you!"
How did people used to buy stocks before the internet was mainstream?,"I remember watching old 80's movies showing the stock market floor crowded with like 500+ people all shouting stock prices at the same time holding tickets in their hands looking up at the numbers broadcast on the screens. Was that really how it was back then? People constantly shouting prices, taking physical tickets from someone behind a counter and placing their price?

I'm only in my 30's but I really am glad the whole internet was mainstream especially apps on the phone when I first got into investing. I can't imagine how people in the 80's and early 90's did this. It's actually one of the reasons I was reluctant to get into stocks for so long because I thought that's how it was.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hufc7n/how_did_people_used_to_buy_stocks_before_the/,387,2025-01-05 20:44:22,"Welcome to r/stocks!

Say you wanted to buy AAPL at $150.  You would call your broker, it would ring for 10 seconds, then pick up.  You'd explain your order to the broker, limit buy AAPL at $150.  Your order still was not even placed.  The broker would then maybe try to talk you out of the position, tell you to buy NVDA instead if you want to make some real money.  After some discussions, you decided to keep with limit buy AAPL at $150.  So then the broker would instruct his traders in the pit at New York to buy you some AAPL shares at $150.  The thing is you would have no idea when the buy would be executed, until you got confirmation later.  So, say AAPL drops to $140 intraday.  There is no way you could sell because you didn't even know if you owned the shares yet.

Eventually your buy order went through, and you got charged $200 commission for dealing with all this bullshit.  So I hope you were buying at least 400 shares @ 150/share, or you're well underwater already.

Eventually you would sell, go through all the talking and explaining and waiting again, the broker would say you should hedge your position instead of closing it, bullshit about future iPhone sales expectations and AI (for Apple Intelligence, natch), and get charged another $200 commission.

Things are a lot easier nowadays, in ways people cannot even imagine.; Okay, great. The reason for the call today, John, is, something just came across my desk, John. It is perhaps the best thing I’ve seen in the last six months. If you have 60 seconds, I’d like to share the idea with you. You got a minute?

The name of the company, Aerotyne International. It is a cutting edge high-tech firm out of the Midwest awaiting imminent patent approval on the next generation of radar detectors that have both huge military and civilian applications now. Right now, John, the stock trades over-the-counter at 10 cents a share. And by the way, John, our analysts indicate it could go a heck of a lot higher than that. Your profit on a mere $6,000 investment would be upwards of $60,000!

John, one thing I can promise you, even in this market, is that I never ask my clients to judge me on my winners. I ask them to judge me on my losers because I have so few. And in the case of Aerotyne, based on every technical factor out there, John, we are looking at a grand slam home run.; Our town had a broker, you went in and he would telephone the order through. You paid him commission.  3 or 4 days later you would get a contract note through the post and about a month after that a share certificate in the post.

To add, by the dot com era T3 settlement came in, so you could buy shares over the phone and sell them on day 3, then you would just get a cheque for the difference,  presuming you had profited.; They called their brokers and the brokers made the trades for them; Don't forget the exorbitant fees.  It used to cost a lot to make a trade.; You used to call a broker and it would get executed sometime during the trading day.  Commissions were around $25 if I remember correctly.  Then internet came and commissions for online trades dropped to around $10.   Be glad of the times we’re in :); Most people didn't participate in the market, assuming it was out of reach, elusive and exclusive, a game for rich people.  They participated indirectly via retirement or pension plans and mutual funds perhaps.


Online options have really made it all easily accessible for the masses.; We researched stocks at the library (Value Line was popular), called our broker(s) to purchase the stocks, paid outrageous commissions for doing so, and all stocks traded at increments of 1/8 or 1/16. But it worked.; my dad would go somewhere in person and use a typewriter or some shit and give papers to a guy wearing one those green visors smoking a cigarette; yes and some stock markets still operate with buyers and sellers on the floor making deals. A stock market is an auction house with bidders and sellers trading stocks.; in 4th grade we used to have an ""investing day"" once a month where the teacher would bring in a newspaper and all the kids would pick stocks to fake invest in - i don't really know why they did it but it was cool exposure

i shit you not, i picked AMZN one week when it was at $14. i forget how i really chose it but it wasn't random

the next week AMZN launched to $60 and i felt like a modern day Nostradamus .. this was back in 1998 or something; It's really very similar to today.  You placed an order with your broker.  The broker routes the order to market makers and exchanges, or they might be able to fill the order from their own ""inventory"".  Once the transaction is confirmed, you get notified.  
  
The main difference was you had to make a phone call in the past, instead of pressing a few buttons on a screen today.; Called in. Most used a FULL SERVICE broker. Placement a trade costs 3 figures. Easily $350-400 for buy and sell.

Schwab came up with no advice heavily discount service. Place your order $35.00 per trade for 100 s or less.  How much is the stock now?  They respond: $19. You shout back sell at market price. They repeat what you order on a recorder.  On the exchange floor was another story. I never witness it on Wall Street but I think there were a lot hand gestures on prices from these traders not too much shouting like in the movies.  Anything under 1 block of 100s often get transferred to the broker who is out on the floor looking for another one broker to strike a deal. I became appreciating how hard it is to make a living as a stock trader.  I may add Schwab the discount brokerage had a (415) area code long distance phone number not 800 ac. $35 trade is cheap but the people waiting on a long distance line can mean $5-7 dollars on top of $35.

Today, I think 58% American families own some kind of equity. Unaware if it includes 401K or not. In 2000 only 20% families owned stock so you are not alone.  In the 1990s the ownership was 15%, and prior decade was even lower around 10%.   Put in perspective, 47% of American consumers said they STILL lived paycheck to paycheck TODAY implying half American families do not have stock ownership.

Hope that helps.; I was a registered representative (aka securities broker) at Schwab from 1997 to 2001, so just when the transition from broker assisted to internet trading was taking place.  

Schwab was known as a “discount broker” and believe it or not, a vast majority of retail orders were placed via “telebroker,” which was simply using a touch tone phone.  That was the cheapest option - $19.95 per trade IIRC. 

I was on a team that served active traders.  The service was called “Schwab 500” at the time because it was supposedly our 500 highest volume traders.  Anyway, most calls went like this after an introduction and account verification:

Customer: “Where’s AOL.” 

Me: “Bidding 98 1/4, Ask is 98 1/2”

Customer: “Buy me 1,000 AOL at market.”

Me: “Ok, in account 12345, buying 1,000 shares AOL at market, is that correct?”

Customer: “Correct.”

And done.  We could route orders to specific exchanges (P Coast, Philly and NYSE) and some customers would have notes in CRM like “always route to NYSE” and they’d use that to bust trades if you didn’t do it.

Everything was on a recorded line, so if a customer had a dispute, your manager would pull the tape. That’s why we had to read back every order. 

The active traders paid between $20 to $50 per trade.   Buy and holders called a different number and the average commission was probably closer to $100.  

It’s been a tick, but I think internet trading was initially $39 per trade up to 1000 shares than 3 cents per share over that.  

Dotcom era was nuts.  Watched many fortunes made and lost.; Land line telephone; I had to physically go in to Edward Jones and sign off on transactions 🤣 OTC orders were on carbon paper!!!!; Kennedy Cabot was my brokerage in San Francisco.  90s.   I worked in the financial district, but not in stocks.  My buddy coworkers and I would call in and make trades.  And walk over to their office on breaks/lunch to use their terminals to check quotes.  Hilarious to think about now.  My big winner back then was ADC Telecommunications.  Equipment maker.; I would research in the newspaper, library, and even America Online. Next if I found something, I would go to my local broker usually in a shopping plaza and talk to a broker in person. I could do this on the phone, but it would be good to go in person, to discuss my thesis.

My first pick was Microsoft. I bought $1000 worth in ~94. I've never looked at the price had I held it, just checked it was $2.35...so it would be worth $180k today. The broker fees was $40 with JB Hunt.; Watch the 1987 movie Wall Street.

Rules back then for this brokerage... They had a office  that you could go and place a buy or sell order.. I guess larger clients could call in a buy or sell if 


 Had to buy min of 100 shares at a time..


 Commission  if I remember right was min 50 dollars , then an adittional 2 dollars per 1000 dollars of stock purchased.


The thing back then you actually got stock cirtificates  mailed to you with  the name of the corp and the quantity.....   Thats the one thing I miss about the old days..

And if you wanted to sell you had to deliver the certificates to the broker......; A family friend was a stockbroker in the 80s and 90s. It was mostly a paper trail but they were a lazy fucker so they rarely filed the papers and every time someone was fired they’d shove all their papers into that persons desk and blame them. I can’t imagine how many portfolios (and maybe lives) they destroyed through sheer laziness.; I’m thinking you had to hire someone like a financial advisor who invests for you.  My parents still use one.; With a telephone call; In the old days you'd either call your stock broker to have them make the trade for you, or they would call you trying to push a stock onto you.

Because of the inconvenience and high fees people were typically more buy and hold investors looking to invest in blue chips and liking dividends.

Mutual funds were around for a long time but really became more popular in the 80s and 90s.; Someone needs to watch Trading Places.; Literally by calling your stock broker on the phone.  Either that or snail-mailing in a buy/sell order.  This was shortly after dinosaurs roamed the Earth.; I remember 18 years ago having to ring my broker up to buy/sell. Brokerage was a killer. Online brokers are a godsend.; In the 70s, early 80s, you'd call your broker with a buy order for X shares.  Prices weren't done by the penny, instead by the 1/8ths and the spread between buy and sell was usually pretty big.  Individual stocks ruled, Mutual funds and Indexes were much less popular.; Read WSJ and call your broker; I bought and sold stocks before the world wide web, and so before apps too. 
I've been with Schwab the entire time. 
You could call a guy and put in your order, or you could telephone touch tone, using 0-9, # and * to enter an order. That was state of the art in tech. 

It worked fine and you got good at it. Needless to say, there was a lot less retail speculating and much more investing. 

It just so happened I worked in tech on Wall Street from that time through the beginning of the WWW. 
My earlier work was building trading systems on Apollo, then Sun workstations - predecessors to PCs, certainly PCs with performance enough to do networking, graphics and trading. Then on PCs, then some other guys built retail systems on PCs.  

Wild great times. Great stories.; My mom used to be a telephone broker; Boiler room is good too; My grandfather would sit in front of the cable TV stock channel back in the 80's. Phone right next to him.  I remember one day my dad went over to install a new cable box. He was without service for about 30 minutes and getting really concerned about it not working and missing out on something.; You had to hire and be accepted by a broker.

You’d place trades in writing or over the phone.  Generally you’d give them max and min values and a future date of say a week or two out. If you did large enough orders or had a good relationship with your broker they might tell the recent price trader.  They expected you to use the correct lingo and they’d record your order on tapes as proof.  

 There was a system you could call after the end of the day and hear the status of your order, otherwise you’d just wait and be notified by mail.   

Commissions could be $50 or more per trade, so you’d have to be very good or do large trades so that the buy and sell commission didn’t eat your whole gain.  It was “normal” to buy say $300 worth of a stock and know that you’d have to sell it for at least $400 before you’d be green. 

Brokers did 100 shares by default, also known as a board lot.  If you had a good relationship with a good broker they could try to do smaller lot sizes for you by convincing someone else to join your order at a similar price range.  

There was no real time pricing available to normal people.  Tickers were printed on paper, called a ticker tape.  For pricing you’d check the morning newspaper which showed the previous day’s info for each stock.  

Basic info and statistics of companies was not readily available so before investing in stocks that weren’t household names like GE or IBM, you’d often buy research reports ranging from $60-$100.  

With personal computers and modems came the advent of a normal person being able to get 15 minute delayed quotes which was astounding.

Younger me could not have envisioned a day when real time quotes would be available for free.; lol my first experience was going down to scottrade and giving them a check for a purchase I made 3 days earlier. Crazy; Brokers did the job; telephone; There were brokers and independent broker houses. You picked up the phone and sent in an order.; Taxi drivers ruled the discourse by explaining the sure bets they had; Chisel their orders on stone and have it delivered by pterodactyls; Watch the doco floored.  I think there were technically futures traders rather than buying and selling spot.  

At least early this century I would have to ring my bank to get a stock broker.  Give me the price over the phone with a $90 trading fee; My dad used to pick stocks in the Sunday paper and send his order by mail.; Ticker Tape Parades.; You’d have a broker and call them to trade stocks.; Before online trading I'd have to call all trades in. Verbal confirmation of your request, a person at the other end, it was wild. I would zip out of class and use a payphone when I was in university. -; Phone orders; Call the broker and the commission is like $50 bucks per trade.; My grandpa had a broker at his bank he called. But back in the day, you made few trades as an average person.; Stock brokers did all of the trading.; They called Investors Centre; Call your broker and place your order and mail in your cheque.; Mid 1990s, I could move stocks around in my 401k with an automated phone system. Clunky as hell and was usually better to just wait and talk to someone.; There is a movie called Boiler Room that goes over this.; Legg Mason was my broker called them they would buy or sell for you and it was 50 dollars a trade you had to make dam sure you were going to make money with them expensive fees; Wish I were in my 30's.; Once you had an account somewhere, you called your broker to place an order; he'd give you the current market (IBM 110 1/2 bid 110 3/4 offered, 1000 X 1000). The broker sends the ticket to the cage, who sends it to the floor trader, who buys the stock for you at 110 3/4 and charges you a commission. If he makes a market in the stock he might be able to save an eighth or so, which the  broker keeps. This was in the 1980's, back when I was a broker.; Compushare - what a PITA cleaning that mess up with my dads stock. Medallion Signatures to get anything changed,; 📞; I’m old enough to remember you calling your broker to even get a stock prIce over the phone. You placed your order, it was sent to the floor of Wall Street, it was filled and the person on the phone gave you confirmation of shares bought and at what price; On a trading floor or by direct connection with the precursors to the modern internet or via radio / phone; you call a guy and he buys it for you.; A phone; You would pick up the phone and call your broker until 1998 or so ; The idea of regular people doing things in real time was close to impossible, not to mention huge fees involved. I bought shares ofa company I worked at(payroll deduction), and after I left, I had to go to a broker(Edward Jones, in my case), and they charged me around 90 bucks to sell just over a thousand dollars of stock I held.; They would pick up the phone and call their broker.; I would call my broker and say buy this, call and say sell this. The end. When I sold, the commission was taken off the top.; During the 2000 Dotcom Bubble, I was in high school and had just opened my trading account.

I suppose you could argue that the internet was not yet quite mainstream. 

Dial-up modems were still commonplace and smartphones were mere prototypes at the time.

I used to log into my trading account at the school's computer lab and trade there. 

I also used to use the payphones to call the 1-800 number to talk to a broker to execute a trade. 

Thankfully, they already had discount brokers at the time (no advice was given) and so trades only cost me $24.99.; In the 1980s one could key in a stock trade order on a touch tone phone.  Fidelity was one of the brokers that offered this.; I remember during the late 90's I could buy stocks at any ATM machine. Trades would take a few days to be final, but it was easier than getting on the phone with a broker.; I was trying to swing trade in the mid 2000s in Australia with a broker in the phone…

It was basically impossible.


I gave up after 6 months.

Here I am at 38 almost full time trading.; Oh man. Let’s see. 

First I’d answer the phone or talk to the customer that walked in/had an appointment. 

Then I’d pull out a paper ticket and right up the order details - either using a ticker or calling a trading desk for a quote. Have the customer sign the ticket if they were in office or check a box saying I took the call over the phone. I’d hand the ticket off to a runner whose job was to get all the trades to the trading desk. At some point they’d provide me with the execution details if it did. I’d return call the customer to give them the execution details and to have them send a check. 

It was a great time to find arbitrage deals.; Through a broker. Trades were manually placed.; Do any of you remember Valueline? My BIL had a shelf filled with their reports.; reminds me of the old joke;

guy calls his broker, says ""what's looking good today?""

broker says ""Can't talk now, we're in turmoil!""

guys says ""excellent, buy me 1,000.""; Trading places with Eddie Murphy and dan akroyd shows digital trading in the 80s as revolutionary tech available only to wall street elites.; You called the wolf of wall street, and he sold you a worthless penny stock for a 50% commission. ; I always wanted to buy Apple back in the day but I was young and Stupid and had no idea how to do it. A friend walked into a bank and bought shares afew years later. Anyway, it was nearly impossible for the common man on the street to buy because lack of knowledge and no one was doing it in the UK anyway.; I can't talk on the phone; it makes me nervous. I wouldn't have been able to manage in the old days.; Not many people traded stocks in 70-80s. It was pretty rare for common folk. You had to get a hold of your broker and wait days for them to lock in a trade for you. I imagine swing trading was not possible lol. My dad tells me some good stories; Read the book “reminisces of a stock operator”

A very fun read about a stock trader 100 years ago. Lots of detail on the actual processes used back then.; Until Reg NMS was implemented around 2007, stock trading was very manual at the point of sale, especially for orders over 1,000 shares.  Nasdaq market makers only offered automatic execution based on the quote up to that share size, and they could alter the share amount at any time at their discretion.  At the NYSE there was an open out cry system at the point of sale the required brokers with an order for a specific stock to physically appear at a specific geographic point on the floor of the exchange called a specialist post.  Smaller orders could be routed there via the dot system.; Through brokers; You called the brokerage and spoke to a person or went into the brokerage in person and talked to someone to place a buy or sell order.; Wolf of Wall Street; When I was a kid I remember looking at the newspaper at stocks and tracking them day by day. At that time though I think Internet trading was starting to become a thing. Also I would just talk to my dad about it not actually make the trades.; You used a “stock broker”, a person you called on the phone and who placed the trade for you. The broker was paid a commission for every transaction.

When I was growing up, “stock broker” was synonymous with a high paying income, and people mentioned it in the same breath as “doctor” and “lawyer”.; The images you are referring to still occur on Wall Street.  When you make your internet trade a trader is getting another little chunk of $ on each share.   The internet just allows you to more quickly make trades.; You called your broker and waited a few hours for them to call you back.; I had to make a phone call to an employee of Charles Schwab and wait a few days for a confirmation call back.; Have you ever heard of telephones?

You can even see plenty of people of phones in old footage of stock exchange trading floors.

Weird to ask such a question that has an obvious answer.; I opened an IRA in 1984 and did it through my bank. They didn’t have a Roth back then. I didn’t do stocks back then but opened my E*Trade account in 1997. 2001 was my worst year but I wasn’t all-in on tech, so my losses weren’t nearly as bad as a lot of people I knew. Things got good again around 2003 until 2009 but I bought when the market crashed because I figured it didn’t really matter and the chance of an upside was higher than a collapse. Did the same thing with Covid. I’m quite well off on paper. I’m not a wallstreetbets bro; You used a broker, who often times was hard to reach in a bad market--- unless you were his top 10, and they would also churn your account.; Yeah, I can lose money much faster now!; Since it was over the phone, how would you pay the money to the broker? Would he mail you a bill a few weeks later? Or would you just tell him your bank account numbers to do a transfer right then?; Imagine how many other industries this should happen to… I’m looking at mortgage & insurance brokers, maybe car and real estate sales. Lots of middlemen paper-pushers out there.; I’m wondering if the old way was more prone to stock market crashes simply because of the way the system was set up. People would catch wind about a sell off, panic call their broker and tell them to sell everything. I also think not having live market pricing would add to the panic during a sell off because there was so much uncertainty.; > Eventually your buy order went through, and you got charged $200 commission for dealing with all this bullshit. So I hope you were buying at least 400 shares @ 150/share, or you're well underwater already.
> 
> 

Don't forget, many brokers required you to buy shares in lots of 100. Some offered smaller amounts, but usually with more fees.; True!  I remember my dad making calls to place trades back in the day.  He'd be on hold a lot.

When the internet came around, I was the person he called lol.   Progress is awesome!; jesus that is a lot of fees and annoyance; In fact this is the reason why the US stock market will continue to grow, maybe be 5 times or 10 times bigger. The US is best placed and the most attractive market in the world by far to take in investors money from around the world who can now invest using online platforms which are now becoming popular in developing countries. Just being in any US stock I believe puts you in position to take advantage of this. This is all my opinion and not investing advice of course.; Did the brokers bundle individual clients' buys with their institutional orders?; Day trading was possible then if you were in the trading floor all day.; The dollar was alot more valuable back then, too.; Funny you say it's easier when there's millions of failure to delivers every day across all stocks

Edit: we are also still on T+1 settlement given the advance in tech; My first thought was also Wolf of Wall Street.; How'd you fuckin do that?!; The sick thing about this is I underwent sales training during a job for which I now have PTSD and the manager used Belforts “straight line” technique and this reads exactly like a script we used; Fucking John, some guys have all the luck. He could pay off his mortgage; This was great!; Blue Horseshoe loves Aerotyne International.; Thru investor center; Was the commission a high price? I pay 65 cents per contract, today; Those brokers would charge [$39 per trade](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/s/b5TepX8j27), more for large orders or orders that aren’t in round lots of 100 shares. It was a much more manual process back then, but also brokers loved to pitch themselves as having some unique insight. 

There were also direct stock purchase programs, some of which still exist at Computershare. You’d pay maybe $2 per trade but the trade executed on a designated date, say the 3rd Thursday of each month. 

I grew up on *The Motley Fool Investment Guide* and they advised if you’re going to invest in individual stocks to try to keep your fees below 2% per year. For smaller-time folks that might mean one purchase every few paychecks and a year or more to build out a reasonable number of positions.; Some brokerages still offer trading via phone although not sure why anyone would use it unless there was some type of online outage; I still do this with my wealth management account.; I spoke with older guy, he said he was active in 1970s, 1980s, when trade commission were 1% of value. At 2% roundtrip,  he could only buy & hold each stock.; I don’t remember exactly, but I think my first trade in the late 80s (through my mom) cost like 35 bucks to buy and 35 to sell. 

I find it interesting that sooo many just don’t understand how inaccessible the market was. Every step of doing something like a simple trade today was 10x more difficult.; Makes sense why the markets move so much faster nowadays ie the Covid sell off.; I remember opening my first brokerage account with my bank and being shocked that I get 100 free trades a year when.  This was at a time when seemingly every commercial break had Scottrade showing how their $8 trade fees would save you so hundreds of dollars a year in fees and grow to the hundreds of thousands of dollars by retirement.; \^This.; 1/32 increments are still the standard in certain futures markets.; My dad had a car phone in 1988 and the entire way to school he would be on the phone with his broker making trades and tracking different prices and stocks. Today my dad is in his 70s has like 10 monitors at his desk and basically does the same thing but without talking to anyone on the phone.; Hahahah; If anyone invests in Emerging Markets sovereign debt or corporate debt, it's an OTC market where you have to negotiate with banks to provide liquidity.

There's nothing like trying to sell Chinese property debt and no bank wants to even make you a market. Or having to wait weeks for a bank to provide liquidity because the issue you want to buy is so old that they have to ring private banks around China to see if there are any willing sellers in a large size.; are you still holding those fake AMZN?; Prices sometimes update multiple times a second these days. How often did the bid/ask price refresh back in those days?;  ADC Telecommunications rolled up into COMM because big fish eat little fish.; Yes the newspapers - most homes had them delivered and there was always a stock section with pages and pages of tickers, opening prices, closing prices, etc.; Concur, was working Downtown in 1987.  Anyone remember Quotrons?; And today we read WSB (WallStreetBets) and place orders on our phones.

Ah how sweet; I totally forgot about the auto system. I think Fidelity or Merrill Lynch had an awful one I used to use sometimes.; Five guys named Vinny.; https://xkcd.com/1053/; It's a feature. Not a bug.; And not just on broker commissions either.; I made 600$ on the shitter daytrading an option today really makes you think

it's also crazy to me that 40% of the country doesn't even have that much in their checking account; You had a brokerage account that was liquid or you connected it to your bank account. You paid fees + trade to buy in and then when you sold, the fees could come out of the trade or the account. They could also cut you a physical check and mail it to you. I can remember Fidelity cutting me a check and mailing it to my college PO box in 2009 when I opened an Optionsxpress account.; Real estate is the one that gets me. There's no reason anyone should be getting any percentage based commission on houses, especially not both buyer and seller realtors. It's thousands, maybe tens of thousands, of dollars for me to look at Redfin and tell them what I want just so they can fill out some form letters and text offers back and forth. Their biggest value is being able to open the keybox so we can get in for a walk through.; Much less prone. All this friction slows it way down. Also the stock broker would try to persuade you to not sell everything, etc.

These days we have HFTs that make thousands of trades a second and can cause flash crashes that unwind in seconds.; You needed thousands of dollars to even get started, otherwise the commissions and other fees would eat up any gains. And orders were originally restricted to round lots of 100 shares. Stocks like Berkshire Hathaway were *not* for the plebes. 

That's why mutual funds became popular. You could just pay a fixed amount into it every month by cheque or whatever, and there was no transaction fee (I think).; Yeah, your mom was only $2; Well yeah, the MM's get T+0. Can't give the little guy too much advantage.; Way to hammer that one the rest of the way in; There's something similar in Boiler Room. Seth cold pitches a ""client"" on a Pharma company (can't link to the video on youtube here). During pandemic stock mania, a lot of the pharma/biotech ""DD"" in the reddit investment subs looked like that pitch.; Its copy pasted from wolf of wall street script..; Bud, I like you. Just remember something. Man looks in the abyss, there's nothing staring back at him. At that moment, man finds his character. And that is what keeps him out of the abyss. 

If you think you understand, I'd like talk to you about a good opportunity for you and your loved ones. We all have dreams. I know I do. I'd like to talk to you about an exciting opportunity that people are talking about.; [deleted]; My bank still charges that ffs. I hate European banks lol; My pop taught me about the market after I got hit by a car and made some $.  I’ve been wanting to see posts about the stunning difference and I can’t hold a laugh when I remember I went to the brokerage and he went into the office, I probably flipped through a LIFE Magazine.  It’s the briefcases and cigarettes that kills me.   

Yeah man. The smart ones your age are probably gonna make out seriously well.  Other probably not so much.    I’ve run into a few I’ve asked why they pick what they do and it seems like another lit colorful button to press for a reward.  These are usually the type selling NVDA because it got boring.    
The fact that you show curiosity to learn something about its history proves you ain’t one.  What are you into ?; When you’re the one that people need to call to buy or sell shares, you DO have additional insight. It wasn’t like today where the layman can find almost as much information as a financial analyst.; Yeah, a lot of companies still have direct purchase programs. The transactions are processed in batches. When I press the Buy button, my Wise account gets charged in 24-48 hours, the transaction gets processed in 24-48 hours and the shares get settled in a day. Divvy reinvestment is quite faster.; Merrell Lynch was easily $100 or more per trade and each tick minimum was 1/8 dollar; Computershare is dope. IYKYK; Back in the 90s when I started (as a young teen whose parents were just reckless enough to let him trade his college fund), my broker charged us $59/trade and they made markets in a bunch of stuff you bought. 

One thing I've noticed is that a lot of the brokers don't have the breadth of in-house research they once did. My broker back then used to have research note handouts on a good portion of the SP500.; One example would be if you wanted to specify certain shares you want to sell.  If you sell online it defaults to selling the first shares you bought, which are usually the shares with the most capital gains.; Same here. I like having a layer of friction to keep me from doing too much trading.; It’s actually kind of fun to still see fractional values at the top of the WSJ front page; How big is his portfolio now? Any advice from him?; > Chinese property debt

That's gotta be a rough market given their recent issues.; It could change in milliseconds but you’d have larger spreads and smaller sizes in the order book.   It wasn’t uncommon to see a 7/8 spread on a $50 stock.  Option spreads were so large, we had clients doing exchange arbitrage.  

We had to keep an eye on size as well.  If someone wanted to buy 1,000 shares of something thinly traded, we advised using limit orders.   You could move a stock with a retail order in those days.; ay yo Vinnie i need 250,000 shares in cheeseburgers PRONTO; I think i had an internet trading account in 2009; Bruh I’ve been on E*trade since 2002;  💯Realtors drive me crazy. They appear to be parasites on the system, often providing poor value compared to the cost of the service they actually provide.

The root cause of this issue lies in supply and demand. Since anyone can become a realtor, there’s often insufficient supply for them to achieve economies of scale. Consequently, they attempt to justify the high commission by claiming they need it to make a living. However, I believe this argument is flawed. If they earned less per house, there would be less incentive for random individuals to become realtors, and the supply and demand would eventually balance out.

I acknowledge that I have several friends and relatives in real estate. Some of them earn substantial annual incomes, while others struggle to make ends meet. Nevertheless, I lack sympathy for them because they often have ample down time when they’re not actively working. Additionally, there is little skill required other than being a good talker. One they’ve done a few transactions, they are 90% trained for life. Then it is wash, rinse, repeat.  Seems like an industry ripe for AI.

I apologize for being so negative, but the money they steal from each transaction has triggered me ever since my first house when I was struggling to come up with the down payment. The argument that the seller paid the commission back then was total bullshit because if the seller could have lowered their price a few percent to not cover commission, I could have much more easily come up with the down payment.; My realtor didn't find us any houses or do much in the way of research, we did that ourselves.  What she did do was do all of the leg work for us to see the houses we were interested in, go with us, get us in, look around and act as a third set of eyes- finding stuff we may not.  This happened sometimes several times a week over the course of a few years (we were picky!).     Just doing the math on the time commitment alone, she was worth every penny of the commission and then some.      

   Unless the nature of buying/selling homes changes dramatically (like people not living in houses that are for sale), there is going to be a significant amount of legwork required every time someone wants to view a house.  That doesn't come free and suggesting that realtors don't deserve compensation for this just reeks of naiveite.; Real estate agent’s value is tough. Depends on the market and the buyers, some areas are very competitive and if you’re moving to a new city they can be especially helpful. My ex worked like 80+ hrs a week, no joke, and rarely made any money unfortunately. Feels like the internet shoulda pushed them further to the brink by now though.; On the contrary flash crashes can also lead to flash recoveries for example corona virus crash. Quickest recovery of a major crash.; I remember that. And you had Cathie Wood talking about disruption and conviction in it all.; Yes, I know.  Then Ethan Suplee's character says ""How'd you fuckin do that""; That's factually incorrect. US-based brokerages (Fidelity, Schwab, etc.) don't charge fees for domestic stocks or ETFs, but they all charge per contract for options.; What are you talking about?!

Even if it tells you it's ""free"" it just means you are paying through the spread (higher for buys and lower for sells) and/or your purchasing data. 

Most likely both.; If you're in Europe just use IBKR. My banks charge a 1.25% annual ""management fee"" to investors in the exact same .07% sp500 fund, on top of % based comissions for trades.  
 They just steal money from people who don't know.  
  
Compared to IBKR that charges the fund rate and takes flat fees in the order of 3-10 euros.; You must like it because there are dozens of brokers to buy shares with very low or zero costs.; What?? In what country is that? Here in the Netherlands a major bank like ABN charges nothing on most etf and fund transactions, and 5e + 0,05% for shares and others.; And wasn't that great? I mean, that created a more inefficient market full of opportunities. Now we have to fight with high-frequency bots and stuff like that.; For the online brokerages I've used, you can set your default to at least FIFO or LIFO order when selling or do the same to individual orders.  My current brokerage Schwab has this.; I’ve thought about this before. I imagine if you’re working with enough volume it comes into play, but for an average joe, typically not that big of a deal.; He is a wealthy guy from other businesses and has lost many millions gambling in the stock market. It is honestly the biggest waste of time and he’d have a lot more money if he just invested in an index. But for him it’s gambling and that’s how he likes to spend his time and it’s his money so what are you gonna do.  But it did get me into investing. I am 42 now but bought stuff like apple when I was 20 years old so my portfolio is awesome. I remember to open my trading account back then in Canada I literally had to go to a bank branch and fill out paper forms to open an account and it cost me like $50 to make a trade; That's what Optionxpress was. OX was bought by Schwab after the OX naked short scheme got them shut down.; I opened an Etrade account in 2004 or 2005 by physically mailing a paper check to them for $800.; Yeah, that might make sense as a per use fee or something to me. 

I've bought two houses. First time we spent about two hours doing walk throughs of a few places with the realtor. Second time 0 minutes because we knew exactly which we wanted and it was just about finished being built. The developer's Superintendent walked us through. The second time was also pre-COVID and we never even met the buyer or seller realtor in person. All communication was emailed and digital signatures, etc. The second time was great too.; That wasn't a flash crash.

This is an example of a flash crash: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_flash_crash; I hang my head in shame. You're correct; Its copy pasted from wolf of wall street script..; Yup. It usually drops a little after a x number of options traded per year.; I have ibkr but my tax advantaged account is still in my bank. 

Tbf it helps me to trade less.; The issue is the liquidity. If you are holding above  100k in s&p500 I would still go for the management fee of a bank in EU; Amazing. So your advice to others will be buy ETFs as young as possible and maybe play around with 5% of the portfolio on gambles?; I paid for the wire transfer in 2003 lol. I know this because I was also funding my numerous online poker accounts this way; Yeah, that's a lot different than what myself and a lot of others go through in the home buying process.  We saw probably 30 houses (some required multiple visits), spread over \~1 hour radius from the realtor's office.    Just in time spent viewing homes and getting to/from site, I'd estimate she had at least 80-90 hours into us.  Let alone time spent coordinating with other realtors, putting the offer(s) together, etc.      

   While you never even met your realtor, we got to know ours pretty well.; The day oil went negative is a wild read. April 2020; yes. that doesn't happen if humans are there at all levels.; lol, all good.; Really??; If that's the case you should do the math if it's even worth it to use the tax advantaged account. The way it's set up in my country, it's only advantageous to use the tax advantaged account for my situation if I plan to withdraw within the next 20 years, otherwise the limited fund choices and stupid fees negatively impact wealth in a longer term (on top of the disadvantage of it being essentially a completely iliquid asset outside of buying a first home); Depending on the tax policy, you might get the same benefit with just buying an accumulating ETF. At least here in Finland the benefit of an ""Equity Savings Account"" is just that you won't get taxed before withdrawing your money. Accumulating ETFs have the same benefit.; What do you mean by this? A tax advantaged account is iliquid, and a fund accessible through IBKR can be highly liquid or iliquid entirely on what you choose (and you are free to choose).  
For anyone looking to learn to invest, fees are your number one wealth killer, so avoid all banks like the plague always unless they can compete with IBKR on fees (hint: they can't); or maybe even gamble 50% - 80% of my portfolio, right? right?; Lol yeah. I think I wired some money to ING Direct back then too.; I was working in a small oil trading firm then - we didn't know what to do, and storage was full. We were in a company transition, and covid sent us all home.

In hindsight the play was to load up as much product as possible. That's obvious now. But it was hard to find storage at our size. Not to mention the banks didn't really want to lend in uncharted territory. 18 years in this biz, nothing made any sense that year.

I will say I did start buying as much VOO, VTI, Berk.B, etc as I could when that happened, and still hold it. I wish I would have bought more. Events like that rarely happen. When it does it's time to load the truck. Covid was shitty, but this is a stock sub, and when everything is on sale buy buy buy.; Its copy pasted from wolf of wall street script..; > But it was hard to find storage at our size

I mean, that was essentially why the whole situation arose, wasn't it?; Implying you have cash for the dip in which case you are timing the market. Cardinal sin of this subreddit.; Is it really???; The big boys loaded up, they had the money to hold. Lockdowns shut out demand. It's hard to compete Magellan storage costs in a fungible system as a small firm with little demand. East Coast was a bit easier. That's assuming I interpreted your response right."
Wealthfront/Apple HYSA vs Fidelity CMA,"I just spent hours reading too many Reddit threads and have completely overthought this. I planned to open a joint brokerage and Roth IRA account with Fidelity, and open a HYSA on Wealthfront, but then found out about Fidelity's CMA accounts and cannot decide which option to go with.

Wealthfronts UI is super appealing compared to Fidelity. I'm a new investor and Fidelity intimidates me a little bit. But since these will be set-it and forget-it accounts, I don't know how much weight I want to put into that since I don't plan on regularly using them. I am an Apple Card user and just found out about Apple's HYSA and think the UI point applies here as well.

I like the idea of using Fidelity so everything is simple and in one place. I've read about putting the money into FDLXX instead of SPAXX since it's state/local tax-exempt. Overall, the CMA seems like a really good option compared to a HYSA, I just don't understand it as much at the moment.

I'm not keen on rate chasing. I want simplicity and to automate/set and forget my investing/ savings. Right now I am with Chase and will probably keep my checking with them for the convenience of having a local branch (not opposed to using Fidelity or Weatlhfront for my checking account). So I just want something to pair with that to keep my life simple. Wanted to come here for thoughts and/or to have someone to tell me to stop overthinking and just pick one.

Individual stocks = occasional surges in adrenaline, potential of higher returns (if picked right) but also of potential of decay in your capital. That said, I'm betting on stocks like META, TSLA, RDDT, RKLB, VRT, VST, many others; TSLA is really risky right now IMO. It’s definitely overvalued, but anyone who seems to short it gets fucked, so. I would stick with VOO while you do some research.; I would highly recommend against buying individual stocks unless you understand accounting.

Now the stocks to buy with the 529 id recommend VGT over VOO. You have the mindless Reddit community echo chamber saying VOO, but VGT has outperformed VOO by 2x in the last 10 years!!

Good luck; >I was wondering if just investing individual in stocks like Meta, Tesla, and Apple is advisable or should I just go ahead and invest in an index fund like Vanguard? S&P? 

It's hard for a beginner to pick individual stocks successfully. Take some advice from the 6th richest person in the world:

>Warren Buffett, the legendary investor and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, has been a long-standing advocate of safe investment options. The majority of his wealth comes from investments in different industries, while his total equity portfolio is valued at a whopping $347 billion.

>Though Buffett’s investment prowess has often been associated with his adept stock-picking skills, his persistent advocacy for index funds sheds light on a simple yet powerful strategy for investors.

>**""In my view, for most people, the best thing to do is own the S&P 500 index fund,""** Buffett had once said. ""The trick is not to pick the right company. The trick is to essentially buy all the big companies through the S&P 500 and to do it consistently and to do it in a very, very low-cost way,"" he further added.

>[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-believes-p-500-170220804.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-believes-p-500-170220804.html)

When you buy an S&P 500 index fund you end up owning stakes in Meta (2,62% of the S&P 500 index), Tesla (2.12%), and Apple (7.39%) anyway, plus stakes in hundreds of other stocks.

By the way, there are other S&P 500 index funds besides VOO. VOO VOO VOO VOO VOO is all you see on reddit, as if it is the only S&P 500 index ETF. SPLG is an S&P 500 index fund with the same portfolio as VOO with the same stocks in the same proportions and the same performance as VOO, but SPLG has a slightly lower expense ratio and a much lower share price ($70) than VOO ($544), making it easier to buy whole shares instead of fractional shares. Some brokerages like Charles Schwab don't even sell fractional shares of ETFs.; I like FSELX but I also recommend FXAIX; Not financial advice, but anything stable like big companies is fine. But 3k is a little low for slow growth. Even if it 2xs over the next couple years it’ll only be 3k more, which even minimum wage will net. But; everyone’s gotta start somewhere. Index fund would get you from 3k now to like 3.4k by next year at this time. Since it’s lower, again, not financial advice, id say company stocks; I am a huge fan of VOO. Companies have good years, and bad years, but the market itself will generally march upward over time. ; The ones you mentioned were hot stocks. Likely buy at highest price hoping for subsequent rallies.  Best is own an index. S&P had a good year in 2024. Until last spring the analysts thought the recession was near and its performance was worse than owning gold. Then AI hype rallied but we only had two 3 rallies in 2024 got us so far. In 2025 most do not expect another +25% return as many companies can not afford that kind of spending with little revenue to justify.  If you really want to try speculative AI, ""Mags"" etf is Faanng mirror image. It is hedged with 47% Treasury or they will flip flop on a daily basis.  No guarantee it will bring you richness but can promise some upside potential. Good luck.; Index funds like VOO & IJR are good options to begin. You can buy small amounts as you go along. I used to set aside $100 each month and buy random stocks. You can buy smaller amounts like $10 or whatever your budget allows. Always reinvest the dividends. Make it fun, for example I used to buy $25 in McDonald's stock every time I bought something from them. This helped curb my desire to go there and also made me save/invest some money. I have done similar things with other stocks, get a new iPhone, buy $50 in AAPL. Invest and stop looking at it until ready to cash in. Good luck.; You want a nest egg and are not looking to do trades gaining 4,200% and later lose it all? Yes, get an ETF. VOO has a low expense ratio which makes a difference over a long period of time. First make sure you have an emergency fund for one or a few months of expenses. Keep this in a HYSA. If you have a 401k with your employer, make sure you save enough to get the full amount they match (if any). Matched 401k is an instant 100% profit. Then start saving in your ETF. Add to it every paycheck what you can afford while also adding a little to the emergency fund. An initial lump sum is good but regular deposits will make a huge difference even if it's only $10 or $100 per paycheck. Good luck!!; A - Don't ever go to Wall Street Bets

B - Don't invest what you can't afford to lose.

C - Dollar Cost Averaging...Investing a little consistently over time.

Keep in mind that the best time to invest is always yesterday but we are at all time highs in the market and could experience a pull back (10 - 20% at any time).

I had my wife pick 5 stocks and put 20% of her investment in each.

Wash Sale Example,"Hi All,

A little confused with the 61 day rule (30 days before and 30 days after). Have an example below: 

November 10th: purchased 100
shares of Apple
 
November 20th: sold the 100 shares of Apple purchased on November 10th at a loss

January 1st: purchased 100 shares of Apple

Would this be a wash sale? I’m assuming no, but the 30 days before is a little confusing.

With the way the rule is written,  not purchasing 30 days before was just a little confusing. Almost made it seem like the shares would had to have been purchased 30 days before they are sold (October 19th) instead of November 10th."

Basically, retirement is much, much more then asset allocation and investments. The portfolio draw down phase of ones life can be harder then the acquisition phase and it can take a lot of study and guidance to get a good plan together.

Is Apple missing out on big acquisitions?,"
Tech giants like Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Google have all made massive acquisitions that changed the game.

Meta bought Instagram and WhatsApp.  
Microsoft grabbed LinkedIn, Skype, Activision Blizzard, and invested in OpenAI.  
Amazon has Twitch, Whole Foods, and a stake in Anthropic.  
Google hit big with Android and YouTube.

And then there’s Apple. Looking at their acquisition history, it’s mostly smaller, strategic buys. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Apple

Sure, these have helped improve things like the iPhone’s camera and Siri, but they’re nowhere near the scale of their competitors deals.

Is Apple missing a piece or is their “build it in house” strategy enough to keep them ahead?
",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hsyapk/is_apple_missing_out_on_big_acquisitions/,198,2025-01-03 22:59:09,"Doubtful, they purchase numerous small firms every year to enhance their tech.; What big acquisitions could Apple make? If it really adds value, it would also deepen their anti trust issues.; i think the whole GSAT situation is their biggest external project. it’s not an actual acquisition but comes preeeetty close to it.; Apple should buy a proper AI firm. Apple Intelligence is woefully behind the competition.; Apple bought Siri; They just spent 1.5 billion on GSAT… not many people are talking about this.  It’s a big deal.; Apple Bought P.A semi in 2008, and Intrinsity in 2010, those were killer acquisitons for me, nowadays their ARM chips kick intel ass.; The acquisitions you listed don’t improve the core business of the parent company. Apple is doing this the right way by buying IP that grows their product offering and diminishing competition.; Big acquisitions are the easiest way for CEOs to destroy shareholder value. Id be glad they dont do them.; Apple would probs prefer building in house if anything. They’re too careful and strategic; I think the focus on smaller firms that boost their tech and ecosystem is a much better than idea than get a company they might not have a full understanding of such as Disney because sure they might have apple tv plus but that a much smaller and slowly growing player than the whole Disney environment.

I honestly think Apple needs to focus on their core products and software and make something that makes them luxury again, because their fan base isn't buying an iPhone or keeping apple music because it's the most innovative player in the game, but because it is the most name brand.; Apple has a history of making small yet game-changing acquisitions that resulted in the iPod and iPhone as two examples. 

Then there’s AOL- Time-Warner. “Synergies!” trumpeted Wall Street. Neither company ever really recovered. 

In too many cases, giant mergers only benefit the underwriters and lawyers.; What exactly should Apple acquire?; Yes, they should buy Rivian, Lucid, and Perplexity AI. Make that money work.; [deleted]; It wouldn't surprise me if Apple goes after some video game publishers if there's a market/economic downturn. No risk to holding off right now in the short term but long term, if they don't make a move to bolster Apple TV I don't see them competing with Disney or Netflix down the road. Netflix already has games being added to add more value.

Once there is a downturn, don't be surprised if there's an aggressive push from all the MAG7 companies to acquire Showtime, Paramount, Disney, and video game publishers.; And they blowing all those guys out the water; I mean aapl bought beats for $3B in 2014 and by 2022 they brought in $15B with AirPods with a 60% margin.


Not an absolutely massive acquisition but the returns are probably up there with googles purchase of YouTube or mega buying Instagram.; Apple seems content to let its competitors continue to make leaps ahead of it. It doesn't have its own LLM, it's not pursuing AI in a particularly serious manner, it hasn't launched anything truly innovative in quite some time relative to other competitors. It hasn't attempted to diversify and is being priced out of China. 

I have little interest in the company as an investment.; I remember when I first started investing, they bought a company I owned. (AuthenTec); I'm not a huge fan of Apple products but respect the heck out of their business. They might be one of the most profitable companies ever, and are the biggest by market cap. So any acquisitions get tricky, are they going to absorb smaller, less profitable companies? Anything in the same industry will get swatted back by anti-trust laws. At best, they could buy tech start-ups with growth potential, and hopefully capitalize on that.; If they wanna go into gaming Nintendo or PlayStation would fit their image. I doubt they buy a hyped ai startup when there is no clear path how much customers are willing to pay; Their acquisition of PA Semi enabled Apple Silicon, which is a major competitive advantage for their phones, tablets, and especially laptops. Of the acquisitions you mentioned, I think Skype and Twitch (and possibly Whole Foods) were ultimately value destructive, so I’m glad Apple hasn’t made moves like that.; No. I’ll trust the worlds smartest people to run the worlds best company and just keep buying their stock; On today’s Hard Fork podcast, one of the hosts predicted that Apple would buy Snap. But it was a low confidence prediction.; I thought a long time ago they should have bought Tesla. 

Also thought they should have bought Disney.; Beats was big, became air pods; They should acquire Occidental Petroleum just to troll; Quantum computing would be a great get; A lot of these companies do the purchase game to hide stuff in the accounting and manipulate the metrics.; Apple should have purchased Ubiquiti years ago. Rivian too.; Apple needs to tap into the gaming industry. They are way behind on that.; [deleted]; honestly it feels like apple is just riding off brand equity and just letting it be.; Apples 🍎 biggest miss imo-  failing to acquire Tesla for a relative pittance;  just imagine what would've happened by today.  Tim Cook is a 'status quo' CEO, not an enterprising risk-taker seeking new growth and opportunities.; AAPL is not into M&A that much.   I have a list of Yahoo acquisitions covering at least 200 companies.  Only like 1 or 2 were active as of 15 years ago.; All of the companies you cite as having successful acquisition strategies are under anti-trust investigation by the US government. Google has lost 3 separate cases in court. Apple has avoided this particular spectre.; Thing is, acquisitions have a history of not working out as predicted.  A good share of them are dissolved and valueless within 7 years.; I doubt it. This is not the economic climate to be making huge acquisitions.; They do buy small and big firms and take away their market and tech and then make it at home. Like when they bought out beats and made them obsolete and promoted apple earbuds e.t.c.; Arguably Apple made the best acquisition of them all with PA Semi.; You forgot Microsoft acquiring GitHub.; [deleted]; Yeah... I think Instagram was a great move for Z and FB. But Whatsapp? I don't know. I have it on my phone. Most of my friends do. But we NEVER use it to communicate. I realize it's probably more of an outside the US thing, but still. 

MSFT and their acquisitions, meh. Linkedin... if so great would there be: r/LinkedInLunatics? Skype was basically murdered by Teams. OpenAI: sucking open chest wound that can only be temporarily stopped by wads of cash. IDK Activision Blizzard... I'm not a gamer so whatever.

Amazon and WF? I don't really see the benefit. But I can use my Amazon account there, if I ever figure out how to. {You saved $3.22 on your purchase} YAY!!!!. Anthropic? That's almost as big of a wait and see as his rocket stuff. 

Google did hit it out of the park with YT and Android. 

Apple could buy an old brick and mortar company. Ford or something and start making electric cars? Well not EVs but hybrids. Those make a shit-ton more sense. I think Apple is staying in their lane, and slowly, carefully expanding it to new acquisition opportunities. Apple likes to let others waste $$$$ on R&D to find a winner, then come in and do that better.; Didn’t they have the chance to buy Tesla years ago but Tim Apple passed it up? Then they spent(wasted) billions on trying to develop their own car but couldn’t even come up with a prototype; Apple's vision and innovation became stagnant and died off along with Jobs. It's not a bad thing, so long as they can spin it to consumers that their products & services are superior. Cook is a shareholder's CEO, he's not gonna do anything rash to jeopardize the company. Thus, their acquisitions are all going to be add-ons if you will, to their existing ecosystem unlike a Meta who's gonna snatch up companies as long as they see it's profitable.; They should honestly buy Disney.; Apple's market value is too large, and there is no disruptive innovation, market share and turnover is difficult to have a big breakthrough, the growth space will not be too large, on the contrary, artificial intelligence is now very hot, NVIDIA to have a greater imagination than Apple!; IMO they should acquire OURA Ring and corner the fast growing wellness industry. Apple Watch is now basically just a health tracker and the the oura ring is a successful wearable tech item that’s growing at a crazy rate. ; Think apple should start with Disney(or something like it) or gaming; They could try to buy TikTok if it ever goes on sale; [deleted]; They're probably buying eth on the low; Yup. Apple doesn't do big splash acquisitions. Historically, they focus on small acquisition for vertical integration. 

Op, the closest thing you're going to find as an example is what they are currently doing with $Gsat.; Exactly this. I live in Canada and there would be news reported of Apple buying small tech firms here which have been AI related mostly within the last year or so; Sadly they bought the Dark Sky weather app and I miss it greatly :(; There were rumors of Apple buying Rivian back when iCar was still a thing.; I think that’s really the problem they have right now. I could of really see them buying Disney last year but they didn’t move. 

For me, it would of been a way to get in the sport market with espn and increase the Apple TV catalogue while getting the marvel and the gaming market. But I think again the EU would of intervened.; Disney; probably an LLM; Some company with plans and means to build a LEO Direct2Device constellation to supplement their existing agreement/stakes in $GSAT.; Beats was one. But apple is otherwise more into buying tech, not market share.; Buy Reddt; When Apple still had their own router, they should’ve been buying companies like “Ring” so we can have an “Apple Home” with Apple branded home devices. They first came out with an assistant, Siri, which is still inferior to Alexa. You’d think they would’ve been one of the first to come out with AI to help run Siri.; Most people are expecting the new administration to be more open to acquisitions. I guess the question that still stands is what; What antitrust issues is Apple facing?; Apple is very intentionally limited by trying to use on-device models, which are inherently small.  This strategy is essentially a perfect intersection of Apple's financial discipline and its privacy focus because the on-device models cost Apple nothing to run and they have access to local user context without sending anything to Apple.

Cloud based models are very expensive to run and require private data to be sent to the cloud in a form the provider can read.  This is privacy invasive and burns cash, so Apple is happy to outsource the invading of privacy and burning of cash to third party partners like OpenAI.; Remove AI from your statement and this phrase has been said for the past 15 years about Apple for almost everything. They’re always late to the game and yet…

Apple has never cared about being first.; They’re behind on integration of AI with their OS and tools, not AI models. Buying another company doesn’t magically integrate things better with their OS and tools. They still need to do that part.; i think that Berkshire started selling off their apple position because of this. everyone (including me) thought it was bizarre at the time but the writing has been on the wall that Apple is being left behind with AI while the competition is blistering on ahead.; Thank goodness, such amazing things they’ve done with that technology….. lol; I would argue that is the exact reason why they were good acquisition as they all diversified their businesses.; Agree with all except the diminish competition. If they were actively trying to diminish competition regulators would have a field day; Exactly. The message mentions Google buying Android and Youtube (both at peanuts price) but most of Google acquisitions have been questionable to say the least (and I mention Google because I know it better). Motorola coming to mind, but there are many others.

They planned to buy Skype too, and the reason not to do it was not the price or utility of the product, but the fact they would have to travel to Estonia often. So figure out how well thought are most of those deals.; Deez…..; AMZN owns 18% of Rivian, lol; Lucid? You must be smoking something; those rivian bags are deep huh

who knew that selling each car for 50% more than what it costs wasn't a great business; Because that clearly means they’re the best….; I guess that’s part of the discussion. What made them continue their growth is reinventing themselves from Mac, MacBooks, iPhones, Apple Watch, AirPods and now services but is that strategy continue to work after they cancelled the car project, Vision Pro seems to be a fail and they don’t have a serious customer facing AI solution.; Disney buying FUBO. Called it.; They bought beats for the fashion/social aspect of it and an “entry point” to further establish themselves on the music scene. The underlying tech for beats was always shit and AirPods has nothing to do with the tech acquired from beats. Apple Music is a better product to relate to the beats acquisition than AirPods ironically.; Would require they buy Sony? Could be the move; thanks, AI; That’s not true is it: https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/four-additional-states-join-justice-departments-suit-against-apple-monopolizing-smartphone; No. Apple will be involved with Blockchain/DLT. Stocks will be tokenized and those major companies you named will integrate with the tech. Save this; > Yeah... I think Instagram was a great move for Z and FB. But Whatsapp? I don't know. I have it on my phone. Most of my friends do. But we NEVER use it to communicate. I realize it's probably more of an outside the US thing, but still.

whatsapp is the most used messenger app in the world. US has about 5% of world's population, yet everyone there thinks they are the center of the universe.; WhatsApp is the most used messenger app in some countries only behind Facebook Messenger (except of China)

r/LinkedinLunatics is not really a great way to prove that LinkedIn was a bad investment. Such subs exist for almost everything. By bringing Skype in house they essentially took the only real competitor apart from Slack off the market and OpenAi is the only reason Copilot and Bing Chat were able to be released so quickly.

Amazon most important acquisitions were at the beginning where they bought any serious competitor in the e-commerce space. I agree the most recent ones were more gimmicks. Maybe Ring and Blink useful to get access to data, Zoox is a potential Waymo competitor. Similar to Microsoft the Antrophic investment is giving them the ability to battle on the AI front without doing all the work themselves.

I guess my question was what’s next. At the moment everyone is spending on AI. I don’t think you can skip that investment by just joining later and their car project was cancelled. While Vision Pro doesn’t seem to get proper traction.; WhatsApp has the overall highest active users as a messaging service globally. In certain countries, its even utilized as a comm. medium for gov. bodies, advertisements & customer services for businesses.

Many in the U.S. do not view it that way simply because they had access to unlimited texting far earlier than everyone else. For third-world countries, it costs a lot just to simply send texts and images on a daily basis.; They can’t even with all the money they have. The lawsuits will be crazy; Subscription based wellness models are doomed to fail, once a market is saturated the only way to increase revenue are price increases that push consumers away. Mirror, Tonal, Whoop, Peleton….there is a list a mile long.; 3.5B Market cap for Peloton is chump change to Apple but their is a reason PTON are so cheap.  While health eco systems would be a great market to build, needs a better run company than peloton, and likely far greater investment to really make this work.; I doubt it, Apple is a serious company.; This. 

Apple wants all its devices connected and not have to rely on sim cards and the whim of mobile network providers, but they can't buy a telecommunications company because regulators will never approve it. GSAT is mostly known as a satellite company but they also have terrestrial assets all around the world, including access to very valuable spectrum. For a mere $2 billion drop in the bucket, they will soon be able to provide connectivity to 2.2 billion active iOS devices, around the world. They don't have to acquire a company and they don't have to operate it.; $GSAT 🚀; GSAT mentioned ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|feels_good_man); It became Apple Weather.; Project Titan  restarts with buying Canoo $GOEV.; Netflix and Amazon have proved you don't need ESPN to win broadcast rights.; Do you think Disney would have to pare off or sell espn to make it work? It feels like sports can add value but it’s not like anyone has a lifetime with a league and you could lose bidding wars every few years, as opposed to just buying Disney itself and keeping the other ip forever.; This. Should have been done long time ago.; Apple doesn't have to worry about the US, they have to worry about the EU.; What about ARM chips? They were ahead of the curve and now their laptops are some of the fastest, quietest, and most energy efficient on the market.; They don't and never have. They roll things out when they're mostly polished, and create a good user experience and then add features from there. Lo and behold, that works really well vs being first to market.; Except you could say the same about Siri since it was launched. They never achieved even mediocrity with Siri - it’s just garbage. In ChatGPT I have multiple personas for various tasks including stock analysis and therapy for when I decide to YOLO. With Siri, it’s hit or miss on whether it can set a timer.; Case in point: Have you tried Apple Maps lately? It's better than Google. Who knew?; ???? Apple Intelligence has been released and so far, it is awful compared to 4o, Claude 3.5, and open sourced models.; That used to work for them but I’m skeptical it can continue. Their VR headset was a flop, they stopped talking about making a car, if you take away phones and AirPods, what really is there to be excited about with Apple?

I don’t think it’s sustainable to grow their business at $3T trying to be the “better second.”; They're gonna get smoked if they dont do something big; I’m not familiar with deez, what type of company are they?; So what? The board can still sell it.; Lucid is absolutely horrible. I can not begin to tell you, on a personal level, how much I wish that company would disappear; [deleted]; I'm certain that the Japanese government would never let an American company buy out Sony or Nintendo.; Missed that one. Thanks. This will prevent Apple from doing any acquisitions.; Why do stocks need to be tokenized?; Ehh why not. I could see it; > WhatsApp is the most used messenger app in some countries only behind Facebook Messenger (except of China)

it's the most used messenger app in the world .period.; I think it would certainly face challenges, but it would pass imo. Hell, Microsoft bought out Activision and Bethesda back to back. Apple could certainly buy Disney.; I sold my 2027 $2 leaps but I think there is a position there if with a high risk outlook; Well so far Apple hasn’t got shit for sports other than MLS. 

I REALLY thought they should have bought the rights to NFL Sunday ticket. But they of course got outbid by Google.; They don’t but it took way longer than espn. I wouldn’t say they are big players yet. Netflix had the worst time slot football game this season a box gala who was probably fake and wrestlemania. Amazon is finally having the nhl. Apple got one mlb game a week and mls. For the size of those companies and the fact that there was rumours of those companies trying to get rights  for about 5 years, I wouldn’t call it a success. Espn have most of the games on their app with their broadcast rights they had before.; Amazon's broadcasts have been top tier.; Im not 100% sure but from what I read espn was part of the deal Disney was looking to sell. You definately need to rebid for the leagues but at least you have the user base and the already settled up contracts. Probably easier to renew a contract than make a league take a gamble on a new service. Which is why I think Amazon apple and Netflix are not yet big players but you can tell it’s coming.; EU can fine them, make them offer a worse product to EU customers  but I don’t think they are really in the position to stop them.; I can’t tell if this is genuine or sarcasm; I hate how slow google maps feels; Apple maps sucks. Why are they still trying to force Yelp reviews on businesses?; Someone sent me an Apple Map link and I couldn't open it because I don't have an iPhone.; They make a whole host of products, but mostly nuts; Tell me; Brilliant take; Think you are right there or it's with a long deal about they can't fire people in Japan for 50 years or something and always need to hire more and more; I’m not saying it needs to be. It’s just something that’s going to happen.; Isn’t Disney massive compared to ABK and Bethesda?; Apple has MLB's Friday Night Baseball on Apple TV.; There is a ton to work out on broadcast rights. The leagues are acknowledging the problem but it's pretty twisted and going to be extremely difficult to navigate financially. 

Before we even go into rights for a single sport let's go into just the team level.

Dodgers have a 25 year 8.3bn contract with TWC.

Lakers have a 20 year 3bn contract with TWC. 

Historically, teams are empowered to broker their own TV deals. This should be good, owners can gain more viewers and generate more revenue based on their TV deal.

So, effectively streaming services can try to win nationally broadcast games. Think: Friday night baseball, Monday night football, Tuesdays and Thursdays nba on TNT, NHL on TNT. 

It's such a mixed up mess it's not as easy to say, ""buy ESPN"" because Disney owns ESPN, Hulu, and Disney+, why would they want to sell to a competitor?; Smart. There are reports that Google is losing over 1b a year on Sunday ticket.; Where does Google show the NFL sunday v; They've definitely gotten bottom of the barrel matchups for the NFL, but they've done well integrating statistics into it. 

The NFL is the king of broadcasting, imo it's the only sport that's worst to see in person. 

I could see one of the major sports signing a pretty lucrative deal for rights in the next 5-10 years.; Look at the case of Apple Music vs Spotify.

Unlike a website (i.e. Facebook, Netflix) that can just geo fence traffic, Apple has hardware and network operator compliance costs to consider as well. Those are high enough to keep them from realizing any value from a big acquisition. 

But as has been said, they're always buying small firms in the arms race to keep their walled garden green.; They can literally stop Apple from doing business in EU; They stopped Lightning because of EU. The dildo of consequences rarely arrives lubed; I actually use Apple Maps every time over Google Maps. Find it a lot more reliable, better voice commands, and better UI. It’s far better than it was years ago.

Google reviews are far better tho than Yelp Reviews which Apple still uses for whatever reason.; I guess I'm just unclear about why stocks will be tokenized. There is no advantage for having stocks on the blockchain. In fact, it takes away control from the government to regulate trades. I'm just curious as to why you are certain.; Activision sold for 75B, Bethesda for 7.5. 

Disney current market cap is 200B. Would have to think would take at minimum $250B to get it done. 

Would be one of the largest acquisitions ever.; Apple vs Spotify is a great example as the same issue was cleared in the US. Apple is still doing what they did there.

Apple already has different devices for different regions. In the US they don’t come with a Sim Slot for example and I can’t remember which Asian country but there you can’t turn off the camera shooter sound. On the software side the option to choose your browser and not to default to safari is only for Europeans.

Worse case it’s like with the AppleAI roll out where they just don’t offer it to Europeans.

I did mention the small acquisitions in the post.; What ever feature is bugging the EU is just going to not be available in the EU. Just as they are doing it now.

UK was also against the Microsoft acquiring Activision, so now that one part they had an issue with is different in their region.; Yeah I’m gonna use that one a lot. 
The metaphor, not the dildo.; That’s true but I’m not sure how much of a punishment that was considering that both Macs and iPads were already charged through usb c; Stupid question time: what's apple s issue with UE?; Ha, I will need to revisit then; Yelp is still around? After all the shit they've done?; They’ve been phasing out Yelp reviews and it’s now about 50/50 if they’ll have them or not; It would take away control from the government but that’s why there’s regulations being worked on and on the verge of passing this year. 

It actually does give an advantage because stocks being tokenized means lower transaction cost, faster settlements, global accessibility, more liquidity, and offers fractional ownership. Blockchain companies are literally on the rise and many of them are partnered with major institutions and companies. That’s why it’s a certain that it is happening.; 350b atleast; Each of those regulatory customizations come at a cost that eats away at profits and stifles innovation.

Not to mention, all it takes is one mistake or misconfiguration to lead to a big fine.

Other reasons: Big acquisitions usually don't pan out. Most of the big app-based companies spent big acquisition money on other apps, essentially buying their competition and user base. Otherwise, big acquisitions are usually value killers.; The big thing to take away from Apple vs Spotify is that Apple poured a ton of money into Apple Music, but thanks to EU intervention, Spotify ended up coming out on top *globally*. 

Further, Apple lost a ton of monopoly power they were able to exercise through their app.; The camera shutter sound has nothing to do with anti-trust or the topic at hand. Nothing else you mentioned is a different device, just different default settings.; I’m not sure what you’re point is

Apple doesn’t care about if people use Apple Music or Spotify. What’s important is that it goes through their AppStore payments.; Did you ignore the first example where US phones didn’t have a slot for a physical SIM cards for years? In China they even come with dual sim: https://support.apple.com/en-us/108898

And he said they can’t ""geo fence” like Facebook or Netflix but that’s exactly what they are doing by offering different things to different regions.; Apple lost the music streaming future. They had the biggest market share in music purchases with the iTunes store and they ceded that dominance to Spotify.

Spotify is the global leader in music streaming. You can't even pay for a Spotify subscription through Apple anymore.

And, of course, streaming is where 86% of consumer music revenues come from...and it's only going to get bigger.; The problem is that music streaming is not really a money making business. Spotify has a margin of 7% that’s extremely low for a software company and the reason why they are trying different things like Podcasts or Videos now.

There no incentive for Apple to invest large amounts of money in the this smal segment. The same as their AppleTV streaming."
2023 study: Your S&P 500 fund may be more actively managed than you're aware,"**TL;DR: S&P 500 funds can deviate significantly from the underlying S&P 500 index in how they hold and weight stocks, and may exclude stocks held in the index and/or include stocks not held in the index. These phenomena are more common in funds with lower assets under management, but are widespread to one degree or another.** 

I've been listening to Daniel Peris's podcast, which ran for 23 episodes from 2020-2023. He's a fund manager with Federated Hermes. 

In episode 18, he interviewed Adriana Robertson. She's a professor of law and finance at Yale. https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-18-big-user-of-index-funds-etfs-better-look/id1541649601?i=1000536213781

Robertson's research found many S&P 500 index funds or ETFs are much more active than people expect. To quote from the summary of a 2023 paper, co-written with Peter Molk of the University of Florida: 

>S&P 500 index funds do not typically commit, in a legally enforceable sense, to holding even a representative sample of the underlying index, nor do they commit to replicating the returns of that index. Managers therefore have the legal flexibility to depart substantially from the underlying index’s holdings. We also show that these departures are commonplace: S&P 500 index funds routinely depart from the underlying index by meaningful amounts, in both percentage and dollar terms. While these departures are largest among smaller funds, they are also present among mega-funds: even among the largest S&P 500 funds, holdings differ from the index by a total of between 1.7% and 7.5% in the fourth quarter of 2022. Across all S&P 500 funds, these deviations amounted to almost $61.5 billion in discretionary investment decisions.

Robertson and Molk describe the common perception, on page 4: 

>Academics, commentators, and the popular press widely assume that to track their underlying indices, index funds must robotically hold the assets of that index with, at most, minimal flexibility to deviate from the index’s holdings. 

However, that preconception is not necessarily accurate. 

>No law requires an index fund’s portfolio to match that of the underlying index, nor do index funds voluntarily assume this obligation through contract or other means (p. 5).  Discretionary investing by index funds is not confined to exotic strategies or funds that track bespoke [i.e., custom] indices. We show that even S&P 500 index funds, seen as the quintessential “passive” funds have significant flexibility to deviate from the index and exercise this flexibility on a regular, ongoing basis (p. 5)

They explain how things like redemptions and trading costs make it impossible to perfectly track an index. However, even after adjusting for these real-world contingencies there is more deviation from the index than is commonly believed. A close reading of the fine print for any given S&P 500 fund doesn't necessarily guarantee the fund with hold all the stocks in the S&P 500 index, nor in the same proportion as the index. One example, from page 20: 

>The Charles Schwab S&P 500 fund’s language states that it “generally invests in stocks that are included in the S&P 500 Index” and that it “generally will seek to replicate the performance of the index by giving the same weight to a given stock as the index does.” The language suggests a full replication approach, but it is hardly a commitment, nor does it require the fund even to buy shares in all 500 companies on the S&P 500. 

Robertson and Molk examined 78 S&P 500 mutual funds or ETFs, from Jan 2015 through Dec 2022. 

They go into some detail about about how S&P 500 funds often hold stocks that are not actually held in the S&P 500 index. Vanguard's S&P 500 funds holds Berkshire A shares (not part of the index) rather than Berkshire B (part of the index); the two stocks are closely but not perfectly correlated, which changes tracking error (see pages 37-38). Other examples include adding new stocks after they're announced but before they're formally added to the index (essentially front-running), keeping stocks in the fund past the deletion date (pp. 33-35), or keeping stocks associated with spin-offs that are not actually part of the S&P 500 (p 38). 

Smaller companies are more likely to be entirely eliminated from S&P 500 funds, probably to reduce transaction costs and because doing so is unlikely to materially alter returns (pp. 39-43). 

Stocks are more likely to be underweighted rather than over-weighted, due in part to the need of funds to hold cash: 

>Among the 633 companies comprising the S&P 500 during our observation period, 536 (85%) were on balance
underweighted by S&P 500 index funds during our sample period, while 69 (11%) were overweighted (p. 29).

ETFs are more likely to closely track the S&P 500's holdings, due in part to requirements to report holdings daily rather than quarterly for mutual funds (pp. 25-27).

In conclusion, the authors suggest that because index funds are less passive than believed, the net result is that index providers may effectively be functioning as undisclosed sub-advisors with raises legal and ethical questions. They note than in 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission asked for comment on this topic ""recognizing that index providers may be offering investment advice and not simply providing information"" (p. 56).

EDIT -- forgot the research paper link: 

>Discretionary Investing by ‘Passive’ S&P 500 Funds

Yale Journal on Regulation

https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4553420",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hswfho/2023_study_your_sp_500_fund_may_be_more_actively/,118,2025-01-03 21:39:57,"Without providing numbers on the actual deviation of performance of S&P500 and actual large-scale ETFs (ie. average, max, mean performance deviation), this is a lengthy theoretical piece without much actionable information.; Well part of this is remember the index is just a math calculation

The index can change in an instance , it can swap 10 companies out and 10 companies in if needed on market open

The funds that follow the index well, they actually have to go out and buy/sell these companies they cannot just say I am swapping ABC for XYZ like the index can, they actually need to go out and sell those 10 company shares and buy the other 10 companies

So yea there still is some trading and decision making that goes into an index fund, because again you cannot just invest in an index , you have to find a way to track it in the real world

I listened to the piece and its really just deep semantics and almost fearmongering on something that doesn't matter

The biggest most popular S&P500 funds have tracking errors of like 0.01 or maybe 0.02%.

I am sure there is some shitty index funds out there some johnhandcock fund that does a horrible job of tracking some international index, but just don't use those funds

Stick with Vangaurd or Ishares or State street or schwab funds.; The S&P500 itself is an actively managed index. They add well-performing companies and remove poorly-performing ones. It has the effect of buying high and selling low.

But that being said, every ETF and fund that tracks the S&P 500 will include a comparison against the benchmark in their prospectus. It's not something they try to hide.; That’s why you go with ‘full replication’ ETFs like Vanguard, not ones that sample the index. If there’s little tracking error, it makes no difference.; Thanks for sharing. It is a good reminder to read the fine print of any fund and understand what “generally tracks the index” truly means.; Limitations coming from liquidity and the fact a fund may not rebalance every single day does not equate to ""actively managed""; “Smaller companies” that happen to be in the 500 largest US companies? What is a “small” 14 billion dollar company?; Another reason why these endless discussions about FNILX vs FXAIX vs VFIAX vs VOO expense ratios are so unimportant. You're already not tracking the index perfectly, and none are tracking it identically to another.; great info, thanks for sharing :); Solid post. I’m always skeptical of ETFs and mutual funds with expense rates above .01% and have portfolio turnover rates above 10%.; That makes total sense.  

As I think through just DCA on VOO, my other thoughts on deploying $600K this year are a buy/write on the below 4 stocks.   What are people's thoughts? 

  
I am bullish on NVDA, Bitcoin, Google, Meta

I want to do a buy/write strategy for the year with all calls expiring in Jan 26'.

$200K in NVDA, collect \~$41K on calls

$200K IBIT, collect \~$57K on calls

$100K each for Google and Meta, collect \~$33K on calls

$131K profit on $600K for Jan 2026, \~22% gain

What do you think?; I listened to this and it almost sounds to me these are investment advisors or out of work portfolio managers who are salty people are just going with index funds

They are just going into deep semantic here ""There is no passive investing because to invest passively it takes an active decision ""

Like come on this isn't philosophy , if you get into deep philosophical arguments you can argue everything is nothing or nothing is everything or nothing is nothing.

Also some of the biggest index funds like VOO, SPY , IVV , SWPPX their tracking error is like 0.01 or maybe 0.02% what is nothing to worry about , like if you want to worry about something a 0.02% tracking error is not one of them

Spend your mental energy on things that actually matter; Yep. And an indicator for that already exists - tracking error. Which they conveniently left out

The post worries a lot about deviations, without mentioning that the post-facto tracking error of ETFs like VOO is only 0.04%, which is negligible

Complete nothingburger; They don't want to show the numbers because the tracking error is low single digit basis points (roughly in line with the fees as you would expect). 

https://www.usmart.sg/news/7231958307618062984

You don't want an index provided to be so stuck to the rules that they throw away money just for the sake of following the rules.; If you actually listen to them most of their arguments are not really against broad based , market cap weighted funds sort of like the S&P500 or total market funds

They get into some thematic funds or small index funds that do not track a market weighted index then say ""see here are the problem with these small niche specific funds , there fore all index investing is sus....""

And at some point they may have a point, if you see there are some more exotic index funds that follow things like some buy/write strategy or leveraged funds that may not track a popular index or they might track some index the fund created it self

However I am not sure its really a problem , how many people who want to invest in the S&P500 accidentally  end up buying something else?; S&P index committee must be one of the biggest fund managers now, effectively.; Besides a few fidelity zero index funds almost all of them have expense ratios over 0.01%

Do you mean 0.1%?; You realize that the more a fund accurately tracks the index, the less passive it is right?

The index is updated every 15 seconds. ; While I agree with your overarching point that the tracking error isn't something to seriously worry about, both authors appear to be law professors, so I'd give them a little more credit than disgruntled investment advisors.; Well they are right that while tracking error is small right now...there is nothing legally preventing me from creating an s&p 500 etf and buying a couple s&p stocks plus my best friend's company in it.

Or even making an s&p fund and not having any s&p 500 stocks in it.

Tracking may be fine today but it's a fair point to say that there isn't much preventing malicious actors from making what are essentially scam ETFs.; There aren’t very many out there that meet this criteria. Which is why I stay away from them and just do the due diligence of researching stocks. I did go with S&P 500 tracking funds for a little while until I figured out the majority of S&P 500 gains came from bundle of companies.; I mean there main issue seems to be smaller or niche ETFs that are not broad based index funds

I mean at some point I agree there are weird ETFs KNG

KNG is not only a fund that invests in the ""dividend Aristocrats"" but implements a covered call strategy on them

So not only does someone sort of have to define what is a dividend Aristocrat, but now the fund is selling covered calls on that specific subset of stocks

And I sort of get it, at this point is buying KNG really ""Passive investing"" because now you are holding some specific sub set of stocks AND then also selling covered calls on them

However I really don't think its an issue, bogle heads or passive investors are not flocking to weird ETFS like KNG

The title should be ""Weird ETFs are Weird and shouldn't be thought of as passive  ""; >there is nothing legally preventing me from creating an s&p 500 etf and buying a couple s&p stocks plus my best friend's company in it.

In this case your tracking error would (probably) be horrendous. You would get found out quickly 

We should be wary of new ETFs without historical data. Not wary of ETFs in general

The problem is the authors are sounding the alarm for ETFs in general, e.g. mentioning that even the biggest passive S&P500 ETFs have deviations, without acknowledging that these same ETFs have had near-zero tracking errors over years"

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Maybe [hallucinating fake headlines](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0elzk24dno), attributing it to a legitimate news organization, and broadcasting that to millions of users isn't a desirable feature.

Most of Apple's gains are purely multiple expansion, in contrast to some of the other big tech companies. [I stand by my contention from 1 year ago that Apple is going to yield bad future returns](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ag7z6y/rstocks_daily_discussion_options_trading_thursday/koj2801/).

As I recall they originally forecast 57,000 vehicles to be built in 2024, and the stock got pounded since that was the same number they produced in 2023, ergo no growth.

After that, their cash and viability crunch woes got a boost with huge backstop investment from VW.  

Mid year they reported a part supply problem was going to constrain production down to about 50,000.  Stock got hit on that news.

Then they had 2 earnings in which they didn’t seem to have solved the supply issue with the problematic part.  While it’s not great that they didn’t find a quick solution, the stock should move eventually when they finally can confirm they’ve resolved this issue.

So long story short, 51,000 units produced is better than the recent projection of 50k, but lower than their original forecast and lower than 2023.





So this is a beat; Microsoft ($MSFT) closed below 20W and 50W Moving Averages on Dec 31, 2024.  Yesterday, it closed below its 10M Moving Average for the first time, in a similar fashion, since 2022.  Where is it going to be 1 year from now?

It just seemed undervalued on the metrics many use.; This market needs 2022 to happen again. NVDA, RKLB, MSTR all up big on no news. Valuations don’t matter anymore.; Here's why KNSL is down...

JP Morgan analyst Pablo Singzon maintains Kinsale Cap Gr (NYSE:KNSL) with a Neutral and lowers the price target from $415 to $412.; Low volume volatility; Have half my Vale position but am uncertain about filling in the other half. It's hard to be neutral on iron ore, let alone bullish, given how awful the Chinese market is looking. 

In my model, I simulated taking iron prices to 100/80/80/100/100 the next 5 years. 15% discount rate. So NO upside from today's (bad) prices and some downside. 3x 2029 FCF (and discounted 15%) to get a  TV. Assumed totality of copper/nickel business is worth $20B in TV. Fair value goes to around $5 per share (40% haircut).

That's like my 'max stupid' floor I guess. It is already trading below book value.

Using something more optimistic like 100/120/140/120/120, fair value --> $16.

https://ca.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/stifel-maintains-buy-on-iovance-biotherapeutics-stock-optimistic-on-amtagvi-93CH-3772705



On Thursday, Stifel analysts maintained a Buy rating for Iovance Biotherapeutics (NASDAQ:IOVA), with a focus on the company's prospects for its Amtagvi product in late-line melanoma treatment. Stifel's analysts highlighted the lack of competition for Amtagvi and the potential for revenue growth supported by the expanding ATC footprint and improvements in out-of-specification rates.

Iovance Biotherapeutics' Proleukin product, while more challenging to assess, was also discussed by the analysts. They delved into the degree of stocking and forecasted steady-state levels, concluding that even modest growth in Amtagvi could meet revenue guidance and that Proleukin might become a more significant revenue contributor in the second half of 2025.

Not really likely, you’re betting on a lot of stuff going right to even make some profit, a lot of the future stuff got baked in. At 40 P/S RKLB and Pre revenue on ASTS, you’re risking massively.

* Below $300 million market cap or previously traded under 300m before the pump within 6 months

* Most OTC / PINK stocks

* Usually has missed reporting/filings; no auditing or odd auditing issues

* Low volume or wide bid/ask spread

* Doesn't have any big name institutional holders

 * If the biggest institutional holder is a stock promoter then they don't count as an institutional holder

* All SPACs

After getting downvotes all the time, he stopped posting so often and now just pops up when the market has sold off a good bit to tell us it’s just the start, and has had an amazing knack at calling the bottoms of these relatively little dips the last year.; Depends on what the news is. If it's about the transmission of bird flu to humans, it's great for vaccine makers and terrible for the market.

Yea, I don't know about bg2 on average, I just clued in for these big names (they did Jensen a while back too)


Dylan and Asianometry (from youtube) were also on dwarkesh a few months ago, but that was a much less serious conversation to say the least (but still lots to gain from).; Yea the context on that was asking what is limiting them now, and he said now it is power. (About 1:08:00 into the pod)



But the further nuance was that it was because the initial scramble for a foundation of compute is over now, and that he talked with and agreed with Jensen that it is better they buy a little bit every year than trying to do it all at once going forward. So Capex will still grow, but not continuing the initial monstrous rate of growth as genAI went from 0 to 1 in Nov 2022.



They plan to always own a good chunk of leading edge compute for training SOTA foundation models, and to walk those systems from training to inference as the leading edge continues to push forward every year. (Which means if you make a chip that is only competitive for inference (cough AMD) you will compete on price against depreciated, pre-installed equipment... ouch. Training is the gateway drug to being installed in the DC)

And part could be some relief that they didn’t come back with bad news for a third time in a row.; They are ages away from being something to buy on financials or fundamentals.

I just buy some when the price is getting pounded unfairly.  And I do it because they seem to be the one EV company with sane and stable leadership, a desirable quality product, and a CEO who has so far been mostly good about keeping his promises.  

People think they need to massive scale up and sell dirt cheap Volkswagens to compete.  But I think there’s always a place for something that’s not a lowest common denominator.  They don’t need to sell a million vehicles to thrive.  There’s buyers for Lexus and Ferrari vehicles too.; Im trying to invest long term. I guess that doesnt fit well with a daily thread. Since this thread up for 24 hours it does seem to favor swing/day trading.; It needs to get back to trading on fundamentals instead of the gambling you are seeing now. PE have gotten out of control and when this thing starts to turn, retailers will be holding the bags; Interesting that’s what you took away, just proves people are buying because things are going up and not anything else.; Right and they were overvalued last week as well; 3.99 trillion; Don't worry apple msft and tsla will also be 5 trillion because reasons; Nippon steel planned to invest $3bn and upgrade the blast furnaces in Pittsburgh which atm are uncompetitive. This is now not going to happen. $X said they would move out of Pittsburgh, close their steel mills there and focus on their Arkansas operation as those are modern electric arc furnaces capable of producing at lower cost.; Prolly a stupid question but does this impact any of your HCC like plays?; Dunno.  Looks like EU will be following the Draghi report so we'll see a concerted effort to push investments maybe?; The reason to invest in Europe is that valuations are actually reasonable compared to the US. Extrapolating based on recent performance isn’t investing. Looking for mispriced stocks is.; Eventually they will be... I hope...; Tesla price is nuts right now.  I just can't justify buying it right now.  It could easily go to the 200s and still be overvalued.  For some reason fundamentals don't matter with this company.; Thing is, is I would say the story lately hasn't even been about the potential ""exciting"" stories with the company for the past couple months considering that it was lagging the performance by the Nasdaq last year until Trump was elected.

And I suspect we find out this year as I see Elon getting kicked to the curb at some point.; Now look at PLTR, IONQ and RKLB with their P/S, all of them 40+

|-|-|-|-|; when it was removed from the indices, was it sold at a loss by the funds manager?; Just want to know, should I get it, or skip it? Upside could be *HUGE* , but so are the risks.; the gap that occurred when the election results happened..; He has been fantastic even in 2022. He called like 2800 or less then. 

If you buy when he posts you make a killing; Legit, that is hilarious. So he is the reddit inverse Cramer; Apparently in China there is a wave of respiratory flu going around - this could be what's going on.  

Just FYI.; I've been noticing that there are inflows of capital into health care (volume) in the last few weeks.  

PFE and MRNA are true value plays right now, hopefully thats how it's going down.  

Thanks for answering my question and appreciate your comments very much.; Bots are definitely pervasive on Reddit, but you can skim past a lot of low effort comments. The problem, to me at least, is more the *obvious* *clearly filterable spam messages* that Yahoo somehow can't manage to stop. Hopefully Reddit mods / auto mod makers deal with it in time. 

Dead internet theory is interesting, and grows more real by the day.; It’s the best guess I have. No real news. 

Assuming things should probably pick up back to normal next week. A ton of people are probably still taking time off. ; Agreed Apple seems less distinguished from other competitors vs how they used to be. It seems like they need a new, interesting product like the iPod. But it's also more difficult these days to completely keep tech products isolated from the mainstream the way Apple once did.; Isn't digital ecosystems (Apple, Android, Microsoft, Netflix, Amazon, Valve) such a wonderful development for humankind! /s; Exactly, which is why I detest Apple.

Before I really knew what I was doing I had bought probably 2 dozen books from Apple, got a free iPad, and decided to start reading on it.

Then I find out I can never leave because if I do, I lose my library because you can't read Apple books anywhere else.

Now I buy everything from audible because other than having a stupid iPad I will never give that company another fucking nickel. 

They bend their developers over hard and keep as much of their stuff as proprietary as they can.

Meta has been providing their services for free since their inception, and people hate the fact that Meta makes money at all. 

They hate ads, it's not about personal information, it's about the fact they hate advertisements, and if manipulation is really a concern, then I have some serious concerns for the future of our species.

Meta targets us with ads for stuff we might like, and people hate them for it.

Meta bought Instagram when it was a big fat nothing for billions and now regulators want to punish them for being successful. 

They have transformed commerce outside of the US with WhatsApp basically FOR FREE and as soon as they make money from it, they will be punished, and governments will shake them down.

The Meta Ray Ban glasses don't work as well in Europe because of Europe's hatred for Meta, and the people over their blame Meta, when Meta was up front about it.

Honestly, this irrational hatred of Meta pisses me off to no end when people orgasm to a slight IPhone design change, and crucify a company that has never charged them one friking cent.; I agree with this and similarly I’ve bought in a few times, avg cost about $15. My thought is that even if they can’t/don’t turn profitable on the consumer vehicle side of the business I feel they have a huge runway and a decent moat in making EV delivery vehicles. I haven’t seen an ICE Amazon truck in my neighborhood in at least a year. Consumers buy 1 at a time and are interest rate sensitive. Corporations can buy them by the hundreds or thousands without incurring debt. That can still, without consumer vehicles, be a highly profitable business. ; Very true. 

Yeah Uber at those levels were solid deals. Still think CART is a solid value too. ; Same, I believe in them!; Long term it could go.  Or not.  Thats the fun of the stock market, and your personal view.  

Im not advocating for swing trading at all - it's a different animal but the fundamentals are the same.  You bought right which a few people here don't.  They buy too high, and you aren't.  

Hope it flies up and you make piles of money.  :); I have been reading this for 4+ years on this platform; PE is not out of control though. Market wide.

Some stocks are nuts for sure.

We are not at even .com bubble PE levels; this. also, the money to pump up these bloated companies usually partially sucks the share price down of decent companies that aren't hyped and thuper cool. 

I've been looking into the healthcare space now - medtech. 

One in particular - medtronic. company had some rough times back in 2022-2023 but now has recovered, has continually beat earnings, and raised guidance, for a whole year now. 

yet the stock just keeps getting smashed down to the same levels as 10 years ago. 

similar story with other ""boring"" ""uncool"" companies. 

I feel like the stock market is high school, where if you don't sound hip, you are beaten down.; Makes sense. Thanks!; [deleted]; Mostly irrelevant, US Steel is transitioning to electric arc furnaces anyway and the US is kinda irrelevant to global steel demand. HCC is a major exporter to Europe and abroad.

Until macro picks up, HCC is going to be a meh trade. Good news is operationally everything is going on track for HCC production. And I'm definitely bearish AMR.

I'm just disappointed because that M&A play made total sense for all parties involved and the national security angle was stupid. And the union involved is the same one for CLF so they obviously had an incentive to prevent their competitor from getting a leg-up.; EU bureaucrats absolutely hate Draghi and his report. They also hate their own industry and population.

Sad but true, as europoor I can definitely recommend to GTFO Europe - they won't correct course until germans get their asses kicked by the markets. And by then, rest of europe will be already dead and buried.; It's not ""some reason.""

It's Musk meme charisma.  Ugh.; ... hmmm ...; So Trump won, and lots of tech stocks went up due to people anticipating reduced regulation / reduced anti-monopoly rulings / Trump meeting with tech CEOs.. And the person I replied to is implying that, soon, people will take their money back and the stocks will go back down? Did the expectation change in regard to what Trump plans to do, while in office? Because if the expectation didn't change, I don't see why people should reverse course in predicting the government's regulatory actions. Is there a part I'm missing?; I doubt it. If that was the catalyst, the underlying stocks would be moving. They are not moving and have no reason to react to HMPV unless the disease is spreading within the U.S. Additionally, the call orders are largely OTM with the exception of PFE. They would require a large move in the underlying next week to justify the time decay.; Yeah I posted about that the other day when seeing the META news. 

I have no position in Reddit, but feels like the bull case is around real user data. I’m sure even this site will be flooded with more bots sooner than later. 

I’ve got no gripes with people trying to learn or talk about companies. It’s one of the reasons why I post/lurk so much. I treat investing like a hobby and find it fun to research companies. 

However feels like so many posts are AI slop. Talking mainly around the ones outside the daily. ; You make a great point.  There’s always people who say “the truck is ugly, I wouldnt buy one” or “who spends $80,000 on a pickup?”

Thing is they dont need *everyone* to buy one, or even *a lot* of people.  They just need to find 50,000 buyers.  That’s pretty low.  Ferrari does just fine serving the tiny number of rich yacht club dude.  Rivian can potentialy succeed selling vans to amazon or whoever.; Yea time will tell if it works out. Maybe an earnings report will remind people of how profitable this company is and alter narrative. Espically if they start talking about their plans with their improving FCF or the rise of AV. It has been kinda silence from the Uber management as the Waymo/Tesla articles tanked their stock.; It seems to be tied to Tesla at times. Like if Tesla reports good news on FSD UBER tanks.; It can happen but some people are so paranoid about being made to look foolish by “Big Wall Street Corp” that they get blinded to actual good opportunity and demand dirt cheap entry prices for leading companies. They shout about everyone else being greedy but the reality is they’re bitter they have kept such narrow risk tolerance during a bull market.; 2022 and early 2023 was okay, 2021 and 2024 were a bubble; I’d be more scared about the companies with no P/E getting ridiculous valuations, Quantum, Space and AI all feel bubbly with basically no companies turning a profit. Rigetti bsing valued at a few billion with 12 million revenue is a joke; Sure we can speculate whether those investments would have materalized as promised or not. I still considered it a better deal as now for sure these steel mills are going to be closed (unless some magic happens and someone else foots the bill); I feel like that is one of the advantages of paying attention to the market and stocks. 

I feel like the market is great around generalizations but not so much around nuance. 

This is one of those nuance cases. It’s like with semi conductors. Everyone thinks they are doing great, but the autos and industrials aren’t. "
is it bad investing in stocks have gotten me closer to my dad ?,"Started trading november after turning 18, 
as of today my account is up 31%. 
My dad always put emphasis on investing a percentage of every single dollar i make and once i started working at 16 i started saving for the day i start investing, obviously stocks came first as its much more accessible, and my dad has always been in the stock market. 
Well, me and him kinda got distant after my mom and him divorced, and he really was the victim of the situation but it became hard for us to connect how we used to since my mom really painted him a “monster”. still love her.
But now im a young man 😭 and i have a responsibility of kindling relationships with people i love, anyways, I always call him to give him updates on my journey and ask for advice relating to whatever were talking about, and he always has the perfect answers, and he truly gets happy hearing my performance, i mean i literally hear it in his voice and he has no reason to need a dime from me lol.
We went from seeing each other once a month if lucky and calling 3 times a week max to seeing each other weekly and talking on the phone for AT LEAST an hour a day. 
I really love how we’ve reconnected on such a common interest and i really feel how proud he is and i never really felt that before

[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse); don't listen to the haters u could post a dingleberry on the sub and it would be celebrated; Why would that be bad; I wish my Dad was still alive. He liked stocks. Oh and get this sappy shit out of here. We like to drink whisky, snort lines and cry at the bar because our lives are destroyed.; It sounds like you are anxious about your relationship with him being contingent on your trading performance. If that is the case, I would just say that in the most straight-forward manner when you see him next: ""Hey dad, I really seeing you more often and talking more often together. It seems talking about trading has given us something to talk about. I hope if trading does not go all that well, or if I am less involved in it - we can still talk just as often.""; gen z is cooked. calls on RBLX, thanks for sharing; all my dad and I talk about is the stock market and finances. Its great.

  
We talk everyday, about the market lol; Truly happy for you. Don't let anyone tell you it's weird or dumb. 

A lot of these comments are shitting on you, but I believe it's easy for rational adults to talk about multiple semi-complex shit at once.

Hell, the stock market has brought my dad, grandpa, and uncle closer. Weekly email threads with ideas and DDs amongst ourselves, while discussion which industries might blow. I have learned: 

1) my uncle has a knack for businesses and real estate
2) my grandpa is a savvy old boomer chad who  spots trends in tech before others.
3) and my dad sucks at picking stocks but is lucky to have me

Cheers!; Hey I’m 18 too! Been investing for 8 months now, ever since then been getting closer to my dad cuz he invests too; This is awesome dude. Your dad sounds like a good dad who truly loves you. Idk anything about your mom but try not to let her disdain for your father keep you from loving her too (if she loves you). You seem to have a good head on your shoulders, keep growing in love for others and be very careful with short term options if you get into them 😂; I am 52 years old and have been investing my whole adult life,  my father divorced my mom when i was in my 20’s it was a shock and we were basically estranged for the last 25 years.   Not completely but not close at all.   He is now 80 and recently had a major health event,  my brother and i ended up cleaning out his house and moving him in with my sister.   It was sad not knowing what had real meaning to him as i sorted his stuff.   He had collections and trinkets and garbage and treasure most of it was donated or thrown away as i had no where to put it.   My point is investing gave me the freedom and ability to help, but not knowing my dad as an adult is somewhat sad for me.  Im glad you guys have a common interest and usually there are no bad guys in a divorce it’s just two people that cant get along it happens.   You are not betraying your mom by keeping a relationship with your dad.   These things are very complicated and not easy but try and stay right with both of them if you can,  they both have value and your relationship with the other is yours not theirs.   As for investing,  look long and hard at etfs,  they crush hedge funds long term.   Look into warren buffets bet and the results its very enlightening.; go post this on literally any other subreddit; That's beautiful man, great; Completely awful. Nuremberg trials awful; Get closer to your dad via stocks and of course just daily enjoyment. Glad you have a good dad not all of us get what you have; When you get to be adults you gotta find something common between yall to help keep the connection. He’s mostly done raising you and you’re gonna be figuring out stuff on your own for a bit now so no, it’s totally fine and normal to have shared adult interests.; This should be a movie.; No that’s not bad; The degen doesn't fall far from the regard tree; Man that's awesome that you could reconnect early and didn't let decades pass. Keep up the work financially and with the family. You are already doing better than most twice your age.; The only thing I invested in at 18 were tissues for when I jacked off 5 times every day. I'd say you're in a good place; When I was 20, my dad gave me access to an IRA of his that had $19k. Just some stranded IRA he had neglected. He told me I could manage it and if it outperformed the S&P 500, he would split the outperformance with me. Several years later the account was at almost $100k, and I turned it back to him noting that it had outperformed the S&P 500 by almost 60k. He said that was great, and that he didn’t remember agreeing to split half the outperformance. FWIW, he’s loaded and never provided any support after I graduated high school. 
So I guess the moral is, if you have an agreement, get that in writing.; No, it's a blessing, be happy you found something you can both talk about with a passion. I wish I spent more time with my old man. Now he's too far gone.; Sir this is Wallstreetbets; Is your dad Frank Reynolds?; Just tell us the stocks you’ve bought so we can buy puts; Genetically regarded; My dad deeply believes stock market is a scam, so we have nothing to talk about and remain distant ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260); Good for you OP.  My regarded two sons and I talked about gambling in the market and investing occasionally as well.  We only have two rules.  We do not know each other's reddit username and we do not share how much money we are gambling with.; Same here honestly. My dad is retired and instead of using a money manager or something he just freeballs his retirement fund into stocks, which makes great conversation topics

Tried to get him into options but at his age he has much more to lose than to gain, which is probably smart; Honestly I’m the same way with my dad too! It’ll either be stock market or computer networking advice. Every relationship is different so don’t feel pressured to doing things that “normal” fathers and sons do.; bait; How can this be a bad thing lol; My dad is dead. I need him the most right now and can't ask a basic question on something he was professional at. Cherish these times.; Nothing wrong with this. Investing is one of the few things my dad and I have in common.; This is WSB, this not a sub that we can advice you on your relationship. Go other sub like r/relationships; Hello young man,  
  
I may be cutting corners, I don't know your entire life, but your short story sounds like parental alienation. We are in a time where almost all men are considered \[add all faults\] and women are \[add all qualities\]. I have never heard a woman say that she messed up, even when she cheats, it is always the fault of the bad man. If she told the truth, you would see her differently, the eye of disgust certainly. I am sorry, but you certainly served as a means of revenge. For her, you were only a tool, a means to reach your father (by distancing yourself from him and portraying him as a monster). Your father's misfortune makes your mother happy.  
When your mother makes her  so that you hate your father, for her personal satisfaction, your father certainly gave you the best advice from a financial point of view. He thinks about your future, your well-being. Without expecting anything in return. Your mother thinks about her comfort and her image.  
  
To stay in finance, you are young, compound interest will be your greatest strength.  
If I were you, I would put at least 50% in a boring ETF that tracks the SP500 or WORLD. The other half to ""have fun"" and learn.  
Educate yourself.  
Don't take this isolated performance as a benchmark. The year was particularly excellent for everyone. Making 30% this year was relatively easy. In 2022, not losing money was difficult. One year is not like another. It's the average that counts.  
  
Good luck for the future and I hope your relationship with your father continues on this path.  
Beware of exacerbated feminism and therefore the female solidarity that results from it. Judge for yourself.  
  
(Does your friend who finds this weird have blue/green hair and/or a nose ring?); “As of today my account is up 31%”. We aren’t magicians, we don’t know how old you are. If you’re 65 that’s a really crappy return.; 😭😭 appreciate u bro; You should try this😂 I’ll upvote; idk i told this one girl i was talking to about it and she called it weird; I also choose this guy's dead dad.; Banger alert; who put calls on rblx ? 😭😭; its honestly my biggest encouragement/motivation to keep going at it, even when i eventually take a hit; its a subreddit about stocks; I'm on the floor. Thanks.; so u got left with 100%? thats a pretty nice story i hope i can do something similar whenever i have kids one day; idc about their opinions though; “started trading in November after turning 18” 
ive been trading for 2 months; of course it's weird to her, you're both kids. in 15 years she's going to look back and say I wish I started then; You're 18. She's probably 18. Yall don't know shit about fuck.; It’s a good thing never bad to be closer with parents; dw bout it bro; it's weird up until she has to support her own living expenses. Few years later she will be calling it a flex, not weird.; Put less energy into what people think.  I mean how would sharing a common interest with your dad that has helped your relationship weird? What the hell? She's fucking weird fuck her.; Girls especially young ones are the worst bro, they dont know what's good for them; It’s only weird until she sees the money you make and she learns that ur a respected and good at it.; She's probably not the one.; She sounds poor and bad for your money, hopefully she is very pretty at least; I didn't start until I was 32 and kick myself everyday for not realizing how important is it to be in the market as early as possible. You're doing the right thing and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. It's also great to have something like that to bond with your dad over; you’re in the shallow end of the pool - swim back; Don’t be ashamed, I’m a 40 year old woman who reconnected with my dad through the same. So I’m just here learning and seeing my lil investments go green and red every so often.; I wouldn’t look at Market dips/corrections as “hits” but more as buying opportunities. Think of it as buying it on sale if you have cash :); Wtf, where does it say that, this is a casino; It’s a subreddit about gambling, not reuniting with our Fathers; I got nada, lol. We used to talk about stocks more than anything else. After he hosed me I never talked securities with him again.; Youre too young for the casino get out


(Happy for you!); You’ve had a good bull run. Don’t get obnoxious. That’s when the losses start; I am also 18 and started in November too bad I'm only up 8 percent of my total account; ya i agree ofc i thought she was pretty insensitive for having an opinion like that 😭; what, explain ? 😭; Its a gamble too; Damn kid, I think your ma is in here.; oh jezz that sucks dude; i just like hearing other ppls opinions and thoughts, even if it’s ridiculous yk; appreciate it 😭 ngl that comment was the first one that hurt me LMAO; Yeah, but you know it might be coming from a place of insecurity on her part.  Like she’s intimidated by how smart and passionate you guys sound when you talk.  Maybe she worries about you spending money on stocks that could be spent on her.  Honestly it would be kind of a red flag for me.  I’d be worried about her having narcissistic traits. It’s something that would have bothered my ex for sure, but it was only after I broke up with my ex that my dad and I started talking a lot of stocks.and I love it too.; Long story short, Cleanspark gonna print me some munyun💰![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258); You could’ve invested at 14 with a fidelity account, as of right now I’m 17, started in October with some money I saved from working, now I’m up 100% from my initial investment(2,400); This isn't really the place for sharing life stories, mate; He's right bro, there are a bunch of people calling themselves traders because they think they're geniuses when the markets have gone straight up. Once we get a bear market they'll be wiped out and they'll suddenly stop talking about trading. Be careful, keep yourself humble or the market will do it for you. Best of luck dude.; Who?; one story wont hurt no one"
Do you have a stop loss strategy with long term investments?,"I will start with, I don't have one but wonder if I should.

For example, I have been accumulating Apple stock for years, so long my cost basis is still under $27. That said, I have always just viewed this a stock I accumulate and old since it has always been solid. Of course on on days like today, where it dips 2.6% and has trended down from highs closer to $260 I start to wonder if I would be better off using stop losses to sell and rebuy later.

I have always read that statistically people trying to time the market would tend to lose out because they sold out of the high and rebought out of the low. I wonder if anybody has had success with a strategy of using stop losses to sell and then rebuy (ideally more shares) at a lower price later. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hsctp8/do_you_have_a_stop_loss_strategy_with_long_term/,0,2025-01-03 04:20:49,"Yeah stop losses are great for people who follow the buy high, sell low mantra.; You have an amazing cost basis of $27. Highly unlikely it will ever get that low again barring a complete black swan event. 

You’re thinking about momentum trading. You’ll also incur capital gains tax. 

What will you do it you sell at $260, Apple drops to $240 and you think it’s going lower but it rips
to $290? You going to enter then? 

I feel like you’d be one bad trade execution away from fucking it up and you’d end up losing money and your good position.; Every time I had a stop loss on a stock investment the stock lost a ton of money in after hours trading and opened significantly below my stop loss and I lost a significant amount of money when it sold at 9:31 AM.; I have stop losses on all my investments except options. Removes any doubt about should I sell or not. My maximum is 10% below the current buy price on purchase. If a new support has been reached I will put it slightly below the support level.

If no clear support occurs I will gradually increase the stop loss to the 50 SMA.

As u/Beta\_Nerdy said it can occur that after hours Fs you but it is worth it over the long run to remove should I sell or hold/hope for recovery.

NOTE: I was an Intel bag holder. RIP Pat Gelsinger.; Beside my investments, I do trade and have a solid win rate. I do use stop losses in my trading strategy but just haven't incorporated it into my investing strategy since that is largely buy and hold and dollar cost averaging.; That particular stock it held in an IRA so no capital gains. You are making a point of the concern with selling.

That said I don't thing you typically see this stock rip and or does move well within support and resistance levels.; Stop losses are for traders not for investors; There are situations where you can realize you made a poor investment and have to sell it at a loss, but stop losses are really designed for trading highly volatile stocks.  Like if you buy a stock before earnings calls hoping it will jump, but are worried it could fall.  A stop loss on a company like Apple doesn't make much sense.  Even if the stock does drop significantly, it's still worth holding because it will come back.  Selling at a loss on a strong company that's going through a rough patch is just a horrible investment strategy."

Buying calls✅️; I bet all this nonsense on your chart makes you very profitable!!; Looks like 80 is a better buying zone according to this chart; i will be honest : i bought at 140 and since, i lost a lot of money on this sh\*tty stock. Sorry, but i guess people doesn't trust in AMD as leader of the AI market. By the way, everytime i follow reddit, i lost money lol; I can draw better , i like green colors; Look at all the purdy colors😍; Ah yes, it all makes sense now /s

What a worthless post.; Advanced money destroyer; I have to admit after 8 years I’ve reduced my indicators to just volume and RSI, so Idk what is crammed in the bottom part of the screen. What are you trying to say about amd; I have no idea what I’m looking at but I own AMD; Maxed out my margin buying power lets goooo ; This caused me to have a seizure; A bunch of numbers and colors with no legend. This is basically ""just believe me bro""; Pretty; $80 seems unrealistic but i'm down; Yes, that's why there's two buying $ 120 $100 
$90 to $ 70 DCA DOWN  in case it doesn't make it til $80 you're  still involved; You’d have to check the fundamentals to identify if this is a falling knife or a good entry.; Advance money destroyer; What is it girl ? Is Timmy in trouble ?; $80 AMD could you imagine the smell in here and WSB.; Congratulations. Or I'm so sorry. Whichever applies I guess.; CES is in a few days. I’ve bought more in hopes of seeing more tech offerings by AMD; AMD also monitors SNOW; Yes we know amd at 80 is ideal.

So can it drop to 70?; Ahh yes, another regard; Fixed range volume profile; Amd is finished; The buying zone you nimbus 


Can't you not easily tell ? /s; it only goes up my friend; The ibushi tashikawa crossed to median interval which is clearly telling AMD is going to make further profit or loss.; Buying zones from the fibonacci retracement; Buying 1

$90 to 70 buying DCA DOWN; Godspeed soldier; How come DCA bros are always averaging down and not averaging up?  I think you might want to factor that into your planning.  Typically bullish stocks increase in price, not the opposite.; Yes; how do u find those? is there a tool?; Can you explain?; Don’t downvote the man. *Technically* he didn’t say it. Just implied it; you're free to do what you want. I see just à lost 20 dollars per action and since, the best is 123 dollars per action.

I actually had a huge position on margin as well; what’s it called; I know you did, but can you explain more for dummies like me?; Trading view; Not financial advice 
Let's you're interested in the stock
You can buy $1000 at $120  and $ 1000 at $100. Your average price will be $110; That's what I mean DCA DOWN; the tool bro; FYI, this isn’t even correct bc you will get more units when you buy cheaply (ie: higher weight)
$1000/120=8.33
$1000/100=10

$2000/(8.33+10)=$109.11 per share; Long position? How many years?; Good stuff; That's even better; That's up to you. everyone is different becareful with your risk management"
7k -> 100k gains,"Wow how did I get here? I’ve traded options for a couple years now and lost small amounts of money consistently. About 1-2 months ago however I had my first hit with ACHR calls, shooting my $1500 to about $20k. I was ecstatic, and frankly greedy.

From here I fell into a stint of bad ideas, bad decisions, and bad luck. 20k turned to 15k. 15k to 8k. 8k to 4K. After some time I found myself sitting on around $5000 in my account. How had I lost most of my profit? Was it bad luck? Should I keep trying? I thought I had figured something out, but now what?

This is where my story turns a lucky page. I looked to the ultimate casino. What are these flashing lights? Why does it smell like cigarettes? I woke up sitting in satans casino. SPY 0dte contracts. (I know what you’re thinking). From here I went on a 4 trade streak that went as follows:
6k -> 19k -> 30k -> 100k. 

Wow. It still doesn’t feel real. I know I’m just gloating but I also wanted to share a few things I learned. 

1. Take your motherfucking profits. Fucking take them. Yeah sometimes 300% turns into 400% but don’t be a greedy bastard. YOU WILL LOSE OUT ON SOME POSSIBLE PROFIT NO MATTER WHAT. You will not time I perfectly and more often than not you will wait too long and lose out on more than you needed to.

2. Listen to yourself. I’m sorry but half the time the people saying shit are wrong and half the time they’re right. Don’t let some anonymous person on Reddit take the blame for you losing money. Lose that shit yourself and own up to it. Some people make a lot of money and are frankly way more knowledgeable than I will ever be. I fell into it myself, seeing someone’s profits and saying it’s gotta be my turn now. People are right people are wrong, find your groove. Lose your own money. But how do you find yourself on the winning side? That takes me to 3.

3. Luck my friend. I know most people know this, but to anybody that is new and cumming there pants at seeing various peoples insane gains, this is a casino. Have fun, lose what you are able to lose. Be happy when luck is going your way but be prepared that it can and will turn. Please recognize this fact. I lost money and lost money and said eh I’ll just put in a little more. My bank account was pissing it’s pants and instead of handing it a towel I unzipped my own. I’m so thankful it worked out for me. But just because it did this time that doesn’t mean it always works out eventually. Be smart. Or something. I don’t know I mean I wasn’t smart at all. Are any of us? I’m sure there’s some smart people in here. I don’t fucking know shit that’s the point. 

No financial advice here do whatever you want to do happy new year make 2025 special but not the bad kind of special. Oh yeah and spend time with the people you love and not that fake time where you’re kinda there. Check in with them. Put your phone away and ask them how they’re doing. It’ll feel good for you too I promise. In a while crocodile. ",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hs3rm8,3569,2025-01-02 21:37:35,"

OP rode a rollercoaster trading options: turned $1,500 into $20k, then lost most of it down to $5k. In a desperate move, they jumped into 0DTE SPY trades and blew up their account to $100k. The lessons?

1. **Take profits**—don’t wait for the perfect exit.
2. **Trust yourself**—don’t blindly follow random advice on the internet.
3. **Luck is huge**—treat this like a casino. Only gamble what you can afford to lose.
4. **Stay grounded**—spend real time with the people you love.; You sound like me, except my puts expired yesterday lol. Back to $5k

I had a 4400% gain on MSTR in November which had me up to $17k

It's party time; not taking profits has cost me $20k in principle already in the last 3 months. I was up 10% on my SPY calls a few days ago, got greedy and now I'm down 90% on that strat, almost $9k down the drain. Don't be like me. TAKE THE PROFITS.

No in all seriousness, the market has downtrended this past week after an absolutely crazy year of gains.

I'm going to guess he'll need to hold between 20 and 35% depending on current income and if single or married. Not including state taxes.; It’s 60/40 longterm/shorterm on any spx gains.; A market maker will always buy your contract. Liquidity is never an issue on spx; [deleted]; Is that because there are different strikes?; Those are short term gains so they are taxed at the prevalent rates. Im assuming OP makes 100k from his regular job so this should push him to 30% bracket and state taxes are typically 10%.; the book is psychology of money LOLLL; Oh I have, you either get rich in fiat or karma from loss-porn, it can't go wrong!; Going to zero just means the market isn’t done with you yet. You still will hit it big, trust me; Too complicated, just eat crayons, if the throw up is green buy high.

Only to have it drop immediately and lose everything. 

That is my trading philosophy. 

Don't recommend.; I don't believe in house money. It's your money as soon as you have the gains, even before closing the trades. ""I can lose 100k it's fine, my initial bet was only 10k anyway"" is a horrible way of thinking.; this is called being too scared; So you dont Like Multi Baggers?; around 20% the trailing stop is coming out for sure!; [deleted]; Only incremental income is taxed at the higher rate, if you get “bumped up” to the next bracket you only pay the higher tax on the income you received that is over the bracket threshold, not your entire income (you may know this but just wanted to put it out there)

That being said, saving 35% would probably be overkill and leave you with a decent leftover even after paying your actual tax liability. Personally, I always like to put away more than I “need” for taxes, then it’s like a self funded tax return once a year.; Who knows but op is sure to find out; 😱😱 that sounds horrible?!; 😂😂😂😂; Genius, thank you.

So keep looking at tech stocks in 2025?,"Seven giants drove the market rally in 2024, with artificial intelligence chip leader Nvidia soaring 171% for the year and Apple shares rising nearly 31% over the same period. But stocks retreated in the final days of 2024, with the S&P 500 ending the year with four consecutive days of losses for the first time since 1966

This basically means that the U.S. stock market this year will not be “Santa Claus market”. This well-known market indicator usually refers to the stock market at the end of the year the last five trading days and the first two trading days of the new year rose. Statistics show that since 1950, the S&P 500 has risen an average of 1.3% during this period and has closed higher nearly 80% of the time.



The tech-led rally in 2024 has raised some concerns about its sustainability, but more optimistic investors point to continued economic growth and improved profitability as reasons for the market to continue to rise.

My top pick for 2025 is Google. They are just so incredibly well positioned.

Google basically from day 1 has invested for what is now possible with much of what is possible is thanks to Google.

Compare Google to OpenAI for example.

Search will go to agents and there is nobody better positioned than Google to win the agent space.

There is no company that has anywhere near the reach that Google enjoys.

Take cars. Google now has the largest car maker in the world, VW, GM, Ford, Honda a bunch of others ones now using Android Automotive as their vehicle OS. Do not confuse this with Android Auto. Google will just put Astra in all these cars. Compare this to OpenAI that has zero access to automobiles.

Same story with TVs. Google has Hisense, TCL, Samsung and a bunch of other TV manufactures using Google TV as their TV OS. Google will have all these TVs get Astra. Compare this to OpenAI that has zero on TVs.

Then there is phones. The most popular OS in the world is Android. Google has over 3 billion active devices running Android and they will offer Astra on all of these phones. Compare this to OpenAI that does not even have a phone operating system.

Then there is Chrome. The most popular browser. Compare this to OpenAI that does not have a browser. Google will be offering Astra built into Chrome.

But that is really only half the story. The other is Google has the most popular applications people use and those will be fully integrated into Astra.

So you are driving and Astra will realize you are close to being out of gas and will tap into Google Maps to give you the gas station ad right at the moment you most need it. Google will also integrate all their other popular apps like Photos, YouTube, Gmail, etc.

Even new things like the new Samsung Glasses are coming with Google Gemini/Astra built in.

There just was never really a chance for OpenAI. Google has basically built the company for all of this and done the investment to win the space.

The big question is what Apple will ultimately do? They are just not built to provide this technology themselves.

I believe that Apple at some point will just do a deal with Google where they share in the revenue generated by Astra/Gemini from iOS devices. Same thing they are doing with the car makers and TV makers.

They will need to because of how many popular applications Google has.

Astra will also be insanely profitable for Google. There is so many more revenue generation opportunities with an Agent than there is with just search.

BTW, it will also be incredibly sticky. Once your agent knows you there is little chance you are going to switch to a different one. This is why first mover is so important with the agent and why Google is making sure they are out in front with this technology.

Plus the agent is going to know you far better than anything there is today so the ads will also be a lot more valuable for Google.

The other thing that Google did that helps assure the win is spending the billions on the TPUs starting over a decade ago. Google is not stuck paying the massive Nvidia tax that OpenAI is stuck paying. Plus Google does not have to wait in the Nvidia line.

That is how Google can offer things like Veo2 for free versus OpenAI Sora

https://www.reddit.com/link/1hg6868/video/sopmwriocd7e1/player?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=OpenAI&utm_content=t3_1hg6868

Or how Google is able to offer Gemini Flash 2.0 for free. But this is a very common MO for Google. They offer this stuff for free and suck out all the money and hurt investment into competitors. Then once the competition is gone Google will bump up the ads and/or subscription price. Plus the fact that people are not going to want to switch Agents it will also allow Google to bump up the ads without losing material customers.

The other place Google just blows OpenAI away is in terms of research. Last NeurIPS Google had twice the papers accepted as next best.

Plus next best was NOT OpenAI. Google has led in papers accepted every single year over the last 10+ years.

Most years Google has been #1 and #2 as they use to breakout Deepmind from Google Brain.

OpenAI has NOT even registered and not been in the top 5 a single year.; 2025 NVDA Target Price $200; If TSM can break out to new highs in February I think it's well worth the investment; PLTR; And energy; im bullish on penny stocks lol; Still worth watching tech, but 2025 might demand more cherry-picking. NVDA and MSFT don’t carry forever; I've read healthcare and energy stocks could be profitable. Magnificent Seven can probably undergo a correction/consolidation, they have seen massive profits in 2024.; I think quantum computing stocks and energy stocks will be pretty bullish in the short term, though the quantum stocks are looking pretty bubbly (looking at you RGTI); CEG; Do you think the world will rely on more technology or less technology in 10 years?; Zeekr Intelligent Technology; No. Don't do that. FOMO is only rewarded in the short term.; I stayed out of US market all year, as I thought it was overvalued at the start of 24! Fortunately for me, the companies I chose gave me an almost exact match to the Nasdaq return...very happy with that.

I'm still too afraid of the valuations in US market, sure you could pick some individual companies that have value but the ETF funds scare me.

This year, I've gone big on heavily discounted UK based investment trusts paying massive dividands. Plan is to collect the dividends and wait for the valuations to close towards the NAV and make an absolute killing! wish me luck...; My one and only dream is to see PLTR at 50% off from here... I dream about it day and night, and even when I eat from time to time. lol; This post doesn't make any sense. 

*“Santa Claus market”*

You mean ""Santa Claus Rally"" - which is a rally around Christmas. Christmas is over.

""*the last five trading days and the first two trading days of the new year... Statistics show that since 1950, the S&P 500 has risen an average of 1.3% during this period and has closed higher nearly 80% of the time.""*

*""All Seven Tech Giants Rise In Pre-Market, With Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon And Tesla Up More Than 1%""*

And now their average is -4%.

Do who cares what they opened at today when your data point is 7 days? Lol. Maybe wait for close today at least? Currently, the spy is -0.6%.

Regardless, the market was down 2% over the last 5 days of 2024.

So, if you're looking for a 1.5% rise, the market has to go up 3.3% by the end of tomorrow.

Also, the S&P isn't the mag 7. It's the S&P.

*""continued economic growth""*

There is no data supporting the idea of economic growth. Everything points to the inverse.

People like to say ""future profits"" without considering what that means in terms of real data.

The forward P/E of the current favorite tech companies makes them silly to buy.

PLTR- people are paying $172 for every $1 the company projects to earn in the next twelve months.

TSLA - $115 for every $1

APPL, NVDA - and the average of the ""Mag 7"" - $30 for every $1

If any of these companies miss earnings, what do you think the market will do?

Paying $115 of $30 for a share of earnings when there are no earnings or there are losses generally doesn't go over well.; Crypto ETFs.; Is this AI generated?; Everyone is betting and hoping for something. Some like me betting and hoping big tech/large cap growth remains preeminent, while others are betting and hoping small caps and/or international wake up.; Investors swallowed so much profit and full of themselves. They need to throw up some otherwise they will explode like Gluttony. Let me buy the dip.

I have TSM 2000 shares in TW stock so it is like 400 shares of ADR(1:5).; I have been in the individual stock game since 1996 and I have never been so piled into money market. 50 to 70% depending on the account.  I sold most of my profitable stocks late 2024.  I will be consulting with Ebeneezer Scrooge prior to buying anything in early 2025.

I lived the dot com crash and everything I see in 2024 reminds me of the runup in 1999.  Just a reminder- that decline lasted two+ years Feb 2000 to summer 2002; If you’re investing for a 5+ year timeframe, you shouldn’t be positioned for a recession. Even if there is one you’ll be able to ride it out; AMZN & CTM Castellum; I was with you in all the macro writeup until the arbitrary price target for TSM without any quantitative rationale.  I can change that number from $240 to $500 and this post reads exactly the same.   How do you arrive at $240?; Where is INTC? 😝; Buy baba will be the best decision in 2025; I’m paying more and more attention to energy and real estate.; > bullish on energy stocks 

why?; Any you recommend to look at? I should probamly diversify my portfolio a bit more lol; Stay away from the oil and gas drillers. A favorable administration will increase production and supply. The supply glut will move prices lower and reduce the profit margins across the oil patch. Better to invest in the pipeline companies. They will win eather way.; This is the most comprehensive comment I have seen… thanks. Are you in tech industry? AI or more hardware focused?; Lots of potential but how much will this increase earnings vs capex this year will dictate returns.; You mean GOOG or GOOGL?; Not likely IMO, while it was somehow a bit under the radar after 2023 after a great bounceback for some reason, everyone, their mother, and their grandma are now invested in this stock. 

Company will be fine for the longer haul, but even if you can argue that it's cheap here, it's gotten to where it's too ""too"" retail loved.; Why?; Based on... 

You think the forward P/E at 30 isn't silly enough? 

That price puts forward P/E at 43.

You think people want to pay $43 for every $1 of earnings the company ESTIMATES they will make over the next 12 MONTHS?

Delusional, my dude.

I like the company and all but there are better bets to make with your money than that.

I'm not betting $43 on a black/red roulette spin so I can earn $1.; Dude how much did you bet on Nvidia?; Q1 ‘25 NVDA PT $150
Q4 ‘25 NVDA PT $190; Of course, all of this is going to take some time, but I don't think breaking out to new highs is going to be hard for TSM; Forward P/E of 172.

You're paying $172 for every $1 of *expected* future earnings over the next twelve months.

Eesh. Dude.; And my axe; VLN lol; [cool](); Im bullish on healthcare for 2025. The fact that people live longer means healthcare services are more needed, and AI may contribute to major scientific breakthroughs in the field.; Do you think that every company who is at the forefront of tech right now will be at the forefront in 10 years?; The answer of course is more. The real question is “Does the market have this priced in?”; Everyone understands this; Of course, it doesn't want to keep going up like the other giants, and I'll sell once it reaches the right price; Oo which ones in particular? Would love some diversification into solid divi payers especially as cash ISA rates appear to be gradually coming down.; It's forward P/E is 172.

People are paying $172 for every $1 of projected earnings over the next 12 months.

And you want it to go up 50%? Lol. 

Stop dreaming before it turns into a nightmare.

You're in a momentum/euphoria trade. That stuff fades and then people start looking at price vs. value.; But the whole post is dopey.

He's looking for a 1.3% gain on the S&P over the last 5 days of 2024 and first 2 days of 2025.

That means the market has to go up by 3.3% by end of day tomorrow.

More than that if today's close sucks.; Before my grandmother died, she told me not to invest in INTC; I’m holding Baba since 2015 now.   Something better happens.; ill think about real estate when the 10yr hits mmm 5.00%; Why real estate?; Contrarian move. 

I initially felt that most oil stocks were a sell on a Trump move, but I now think that's wrong at least initially.

You just have too many people on both sides really that think Trump/GOP=lower oil prices. 

Don't think crude oil really spikes, but I think it can see up to $90 by spring and make folks expecting inflation relief really squirm.

TL/DR: Good chance the idea of real inflation relief happening doesn't occur and Trump is hiring Kevin Warsh for when Jay Powell's term is up next year.; totally agree. i usually play XOM and under any other circumstances i would of went long when it hit 104 recently but with the trump administration i see more supply bringing/keeping natural gas and oil prices lower; Did work in the AI field but now retired and just think about this stuff a lot.

We are at the most amazing time right now and we are going to just see massive change in the next decade.

I am really anxious? excited? to see how all this works out.

It seems to me the big players of today like Google are going to be so much bigger in the future.  So much more powerful.   I really do not see how it will get slowed down.  We are already well on the road.; It is not a 1 year thing.  Thankfully Google has never rolled like that.

The TPUs are the perfect example.  Huge investment years ago and now really paying off.; Either one.  Some have an issue not getting a vote.  I personally could care less.; NVIDIA is a good investment; But stonks . . .; And my second breakfast; Agree and these stocks have some catching up to do. Kennedy JR is however a liability/major risk regarding Big Pharma. But yeah Trump will only run four years, so longterm I think its still a good pick.; The ones that I invest in, which is why I invest in them.; That’s what QQQ and Etfs like VGT and IGM are for — get a big basket of them.; priced in?; So what? That doesn't guarantee that tech company X or tech company Y is going to be the one to bet on.

So goofy.; SEIT, NESF, TFIF, SEQI, TRIG, JAGI, UKW, CRT, BSIF, CTY, DIVI. 

All good dividends and have suffered big outflows. I also hold GRID - dividend has been cancelled but they have done a deal to lease batteries to Octopus energy for the next two years, and I am betting the dividend and price will be back up soon.; no, down -50%.

or even -66.66% from here.; What else did your grandmother tell you?; Trump's promise to escalate the trade war with China will certainly help your position...; I’m not a pro by any means. This isn’t financial advice…

Just watching a few reits and investment companies.. 

I figure eventually interest rates will continue to come down, housing market will stabilize, and (IF Trump is effective) I’m hoping we see more commercialization and industrialization in this country. 

We’ll see. I’m probably wrong. But, I still like real estate and reits as a long term hold for dividends and often relative comparative stability.🤷; Oil dumps in a recession. Trump wants to increase supply when demand is already falling.

DCA is my approach.

If I'm wrong about recession then there is a little profit on a rally.

If I'm right, then I should be happy in a couple years.; This is really interesting. You also mentioned about Neurips. I don't think publishing Neurips paper necessarily suggests the superiority or capability. Some companies just don't publish, e.g., Apple. Also partly because Google has a research dept, like FAIR at Meta. 

Really appreciate your comments. 

Besides Google, who do you think would be other winners? Nvidia for sure. How about Meta? I like the open-source strategy of LLAMA, and the strong Ads engagement, as well as the wearable devices / glasses which has huge potential to be a ""platform"" for AI. 

Any other companies you think worth following?; I actually agree with you, it’s just the title says 2025; Gotcha thank you; Based on what? 

The forward P/E is 30. 

Semi conductors are a cyclical market.

You think every business is going to update their tech every quarter? Every year?

NVDA is nice and all but the non-researched, emotionally based love fest for the stock is just ridiculous. That's not how to make investment decisions.; I mean, yeah.

PLTR is totally valid as a momentum/euphoria trade.

Go with God. Make bank. Profit. 

But everyone is kidding themselves that they're investing based on fundamentals or values...

Eesh; Cool. Your crystal ball must be amazing.; ETFs aren't evenly weighted unless that's specified. 

5 companies make up 35% of the assets in QQQ right now.

All of those companies have forward P/Es of 30+; Ah. ""off"" confused me. 

Yeah. It's a good short. Momentum trade so hard to predict when it will tumble.; Stay away from real estate for the moment. Rates still have to come down to at least 4.1% before the yield on the 10 yr starts going down. The yield on the 10 year and 30 year drive mortgage rates and that's what drives real estate investing. However, there is still weakness in the real estate sector. 

The increases you're seeing are people speculating that rates will go down. They will eventually but you cannot predict when. They could stay between 4 and 5 percent for another 10 years like they did in the 1980's. The Fed will not drop rates until there are signs that inflation is under control. 

The problem is that the economy is sending mixed signals. Some parts of the economy are on fire (AI, Big Tech, Space exploration, etc), while other parts are languishing over lower demand, higher interest rates and persistent inflation. 

Watch the Fed. If you see rates drop to 4.1% then it's probably a good time to get into real estate. If you're already in and have a good cost basis, it's probably ok to stay put, especially if you're getting a nice dividend to hold the stock. I like ABR below $14. I own it and I buy more everytime it drops below 14. That's a 12% dividend if you can get it at that price. That dividend has made me very happy to hold it even though the rates haven't come down.; Yeah, I'm thinking that the drill baby drill/recession thesis doesn't work at least for 2025.

It takes two to dance in regards to the drill baby drill idea and the oil companies are saying nah we gucchi.; They're probably basing it on the official reveals and releases of all the new cards coming within the month not realising that the gaming market is *not* where NVIDIA makes the bulk of their money lol.; Not so much of a crystal ball as it is picking companies that are profitable with a great track record of not fucking up, some SP500 and some Vitax. 

What do you do preacher of stocks?; There is literally nothing good in the economic data right now.; If you really want to diversify into energy, look to the pipeline companies. They will win if the drillers go hard or if they decide to build out their capacity at a more moderate pace. 

There is also the Permian Basin Royalty Trust (PBT) currently paying over 5% in royalty dividends. Keep in mind royalty trusts and MLPs have their own tax implications so keep the amount smallish (no dividends over $5000) and keep it in a tax sheltered account otherwise things get really complicated (and expensive) come tax time.; Eesh. Really? 

You need people who can afford high end electronics to buy them.

How often do people think consumers upgrade/replace their tech? It'd better be every year if they want to hit their projections.; Which companies? How do you determine long term profitability? What does ""not fucking up"" mean and how do you know they won't do it in the future.

I invest. I write. I run a sub.; Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, and Vitax. I work pretty intimately with Google and MSFT products for work in a daily basis, as well as AWS. Have a pretty good pulse on those companies. 

I do SEO so I’m always up with Google search, Google ads, Bing search, any ai integrations with Microsoft products. I also have access to over 500 retail stores Xbox related sales data. 

A few insights that may prove useful.

Other than that I have some speculative plays. 

Not claiming to be Nostradamus so not sure why the attitude.; Yeah, people often buy the stocks for the companies they know and hear about. It's a common retail trader blind spot.

If you work in a specific sector, anecdotal evidence can make it worse. People believe they have an insider edge when they have specialized knowledge. Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. Ego is usually involved.

A lot of people prefer their personal, often emotional experiences to objectivity. They don't look at fundamentals or the macroeconomic environment.

You work in tech. You have a portfolio that is almost all tech (I say almost because TSLA is no longer a tech company when it comes to trading it).

If you chart all your holdings together, you basically have the same general performance for all of them - except TSLA (because it is no longer a tech stock).

Google, Microsoft, Amazon and most of the holdings in VITAX are overvalued at the moment.

Yes, these companies look like they could be tech leaders, but, the point I was trying to make - a lot changes in 10 years.

Choosing absolutes in an every changing market with an ever changing world is a poor plan. Amazon was a dud pick at one point. [World.com](http://World.com) was going to change everything. No one remembers the failures. They are a lot more prevalent than winners.

As far as TSLA goes?

It's forward P/E is 115.

You're paying $115 for every $1 of *projected* earnings over the next 12 months. Sales just declined by 1% for the first time in 12 years. The last earnings report boasted something like $790M in tax credits - not car sales.

It was a leader. It was innovating. It's not doing that now - not in the same way at least. The company continuously promises innovations and doesn't deliver them. Do you know how many times self-driving was promised to be delivered? 

Anyway, now bigger companies across the globe are in the same market with more resources.

Comparing them to AMZ, MSFT, GOOGL is just silly."
"Are Meta, Apple and Alphabet's dividend payouts actually an effective use of cash?","For all three dividend payout yield sits at around 0.5%. This means that even if the payouts were trebled (and this would take several years of incremental increases, unless the tree decide to go the Visa route and increase payouts by around 10% per annum) the investor would only gain an anemic 1.5% CAGR from dividends. I understand that tech companies aren't the place you go for dividend payouts, but 0.5% or less seems somewhat pointless to me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hr2cbg/are_meta_apple_and_alphabets_dividend_payouts/,150,2025-01-01 13:50:10,"Yes because that way they make it into the large cap dividend funds and get more buyers for their stock.; It’s not meaningless to the old guys who got the stock 40 years ago with a billion splits, I’ll bet they’re getting 20% on their initial investment or more.; Some would argue that the simple fact that you and others “don’t like it” is actually the point. When a company see itself changing from a high growth phase of its life cycle to a more modest growth phase, paying a dividend can start to change its investor base, thus changing shareholder expectations in how the company is managed. 

While these companies can absolutely continue to grow, they likely cannot repeat the growth that they have had over the past decade (especially Apple, IMO). 

Just a thought from an online stranger.; Look at NVDA with their 0.03% dividend yield...

I get the intention behind it (included in more indexed funds) but I'd much prefer buybacks instead.; Apple was forced to start paying dividends because their cash pool was too big and investors kept asking on every conference call. I guess Google and Facebook got to the same point and follow Apple's lead.

And if you look at Google's graveyard, maybe they should've paid more dividends rather than dumping money into things like Allo and Duo. I think 99% of the investors would (correctly) want a tiny payout than watch Google dropping a billion dollar into another (their 5th?) chat app before the project even starts.; It’s an amazing invention imo. Keep people holding a stock for decades and the payout is almost nothing to most retail investors.; Not an effective use for Meta or Alphabet imo. They both have incredible runways and opportunities to invest, same for Microsoft which you oddly enough didn't mention. Apple, yeah, they just have no idea what to do with their money and it makes sense to me.

Oh, I include buybacks here btw. Same thing anyway.; Academic literature has found that investors interpret dividend changes as a signaling component to the stability of earnings.  This impacts stock performance more than the financial aspect of the dividend itself.   It ends up being an effective use of cash for them for this reason, but not for me as an investor.  It is absolutely a waste of time from my perspective.; I would say absolutely. Companies do stupid shit when they have too much money and all 3 companies print obscene amounts of it.

We have seen what happens when Zuck has more Metabucks than he knows what to do with. You get the fucking metaverse. 

Google also has a pretty good track record of blowing cash on random crap.; Dividend giving is a scam. A company should always prefer buybacks since they offer tax advantage. The only use of dividends is to make some grandma funds consider the stock for purchase.;  Don't you need to already have a lot of money for you to be able to get a decent chunk of cash at this point?; Yes. These companies have so much free cash flow that they don't know what to do with it and use dividends as a form to return money to investors, Their payout ratios are so low that that they probably should be paying more of a dividend but atleast them buying back stock over this past decade has provided good shareholder value.; Isn't it also low because they kept mooning, which would make the % lower?

Like how is nvidia's dividend supposed to have caught up these past few years?; Could be multiple reasons: They might did it to increase hype and atract dividen investors, they had extra cash, they didnt have better use for it. It could have been anything. Those companies have soo much FCF it doesnt really matter if they pay such a low divi.; Yes and they have relatively low dividend rate.; The concern shouldn't be what the yield is, the concern is if they have something better to do with the money. Those companies are so profitable they end up having more money than they can effectively reinvest into the company. Returning that money to the investors becomes the only reasonable option, either through dividends or buybacks. This gives the investors the option to do what they want with this excess cash that the company can't figure out what to do with.

This may seem a little ridiculous when it ends up being 0.5%, but keep in mind that is still many, many billions of dollars they would need to figure out how to utilize to generate meaningful ROI. That isn't something easy to do without throwing a lot of that money away.; Very insightful comments on this thread.  One other issue is if these companies were to slash/eliminate the dividend to repurpose the cash spend, there stocks would tank.; There was a time Apple didn’t pay a dividend and was sitting on a huge pile of cash that kept getting larger. It would have been near immoral to keep amassing that pile of cash without paying any of it back to investors who saw the company through the tough years and kept the stock afloat.; Personally, I would prefer the money being used for buybacks, not dividends.  I'm in these stocks for price appreciation, not a small amount of taxable income.; If you only look at the dividend in terms of its current value, it does seem pointlessly low. But if you've been holding any of these stocks for longer than 5 years the returns are pretty good with just the dividend.

0.04% yield on apple's $250 is only $10, but if you've been holding the stock since the 90s when the value of the stock was less than $1, you're returns are absolutely insane without even taking into account the increase in value.

taking into account share splits

1000 shares in 95' would have costed about $400~ 

those same 1000 shares today are now yielding you $10,000 dollars in dividends every year.; Great use of cash. Much better paying dividends than Apple pissing even more money away on buybacks at ridiculous valuations or Meta pissing money away on Reality Labs.; I bought META at $19 and change and it has been sitting in my taxable account for a decade.  My gains are too high to sell it, so I was thrilled when they started paying a dividend no matter how meager.  

Two years ago I moved my AAPL holding to my taxable account because the dividend was so low.  I would much rather own the high payers in an IRA and pay the pittance of tax on AAPL's dividend.; I have no idea how investments work at the scale of aapl, or any mag7 for that matter, but if you can get 5% in short term bonds and pay out .6%, doesn't that arbitrage spread mean something positive for the company?; You are holding them for the growth ; 40$ each quarter from Nvidia is the best feeling ever...; IMO no. I’d rather money goes towards buybacks. Amazon is the last cash printing big tech company not to pay a dividend. I hope they keep it that way.; oh yes i forgot about that, it gets them listed in dividend funds. Probably the same reason NVIDIA pays a ridiculously small, like 0.03% dividend; This. And added stability; Most dividend funds don't buy stocks with such a low dividend yield.; Facebook/Meta didn't really have a choice. They spent tens of billions on the metaverse, it was a flop, and big investors were getting really impatient.

It was the only way for them to tell Wall Street, 'we've learned from our lessons, matured, and are ready to be responsible adults.'; Steve Ballmer got $1bn in dividends from just MSFT.; or they could just periodically sell the stock and end up in the same place, dividends don't magically make them more money.; Why should they buy back shares when the shares are overvalued? That's a poor use of capital.; Depends on valuation. I'd rather $AAPL pay a dividend if the stock is trading at >30x free cash flow and I'd rather a buyback if it is trading <20x free cash flow.; does being included in those index funds actually boost share price though? Amazon has outperformed Apple over the past decade by at least 100% so I don't really the tangible proof on the index fund argument; Google has no idea what they're doing, and it shows.  People love to say ""Look at all the money they're making!""  But people also said the same thing about GE back in the day.; Google in 2024 has made more money than Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and every other Fortune 500.

That suggests they are making the right moves.

Just think if they thought investing in the TPUs was a waste.; All of those 0.03-0.08% are meaningless; I didn't mention Microsoft because Microsoft has a more respectable dividend in my eyes at 0.8%; I prefer buybacks (rather than company keeping the money) since a lot can go to waste. Meta has somewhat addressed this but there was a period they were wasting shareholder money hand over fist on the metaverse. Alphabet has wasted tons on their “other bets”. Keep spending on R&D but reduce share count to increase value for shareholders. Buybacks are also more tax efficient.; yeah on an $1000 investment you'd only get around $5 back or less on these three stocks, which is painful; Buybacks are more tax efficient for the long term holder, especially those who are accumulating shares.; That was an amazing decision from you back then, well done. That's 500% return at least.; That's an achievement, seriously. When did you first buy in?; what's also interesting about Amazon is how red hot its share price growth is even with pretty minimal buybacks; Nvidia also went to the moon while not increasing dividend which meant the % got lower.; Nvidia does a 0.01% dividend to stay in dividendd funds. The more important thing they do is stock buy backs at the same time (15 bil a quarter)

Making money on nvidia is about selling covered calls which are extremely lucrative.; NVDA pays basically the lowest dividend possible, I believe it’s one penny per quarter, for inclusion in mutual funds that require dividends from their holdings. ; He certainly earned it with all the monkey dancing he did; Per year! He got a billion dollars in dividends in just one year!; That fool doesn't deserve a penny there's a reason why Ballmer era as CEO of Microsoft is often known as the dark ages for the company; Share buybacks would have been better since they're more tax efficient; Lol you're going to hurt some feelings saying that here. Most investors don't understand what you said.; Fair point.

I'm not holding any stock that I think is overvalued.; I cannot think of a reason why it wouldn't boost share price.  Amazon not paying a .01% dividend so it can get a nearly-free price boost actually irritates me.; If you’re buying $100 worth yes; Not meaningless to a patient investor.  If I put $10,000 in a 0.5% payer today, and they grow the dividend 10%/yr for 35 years, I am then getting $1,600/yr, or a 16% yield to cost.  

Giving investors a steady and increasing flow of income is attractive to long term holders, and can encourage them to hold the stock as they don't need to sell to get a tangible benefit from those shares.; Not to a CEO. That divi check pays for their lifestyle ; > All of those ~~0.03-0.08%~~ are meaningless

All dividends are irrelevant, period.  At least on the investor side.; A higher dividend doesn't make it a better choice for the business, though. It makes it a worse choice, even.; The other bets contain Waymo and Quantum Computing which could both bring major cashflows in. Calling it a waste is a bit too early to judge.

Furthermore, it doesn’t really make sense to buy back the stock if it is expensive, you may as well pay out a dividend; Meta is still burning cash; The problem with buybacks is that history has long shown that businesses are just as terrible investors as the average retail investor.

i.e. buybacks in the S&P500 are at their highest at the market peaks (when the average stock is most expensive), and buybacks are at their lowest after a recession/market crash, when the average stock is at it's cheapest.

Very few businesses are smart like Berkshire Hathaway in only doing buybacks when their own stock is cheap.; Thats what 0.5% lol.  You might as well risk it on Penny Stocks at that point. You would see a better return; The IPO crashed and burned, and I like buying on bad news, disappointments, mergers the market hates.  It's more than 3000% according to WFA.

I stand corrected with the drop in past few sessions it is down to 2956.63% up.; 2017; Buybacks and dividends go against their company philosophy. They still hold true to Bezos’ first shareholder letter “Day one”. They increase revenue and use that money to increase revenue even further. Buybacks and dividends would be a departure from that philosophy. Eventually they will shift to being more of a “mature” company but they still have the startup mentality.; Covered calls meant you lost out on a ton of upside over the past 2 years, and you also are risking downside if Nvidia stock crashes; This guy thetas.; DEVELOPERS....DEVELOPERS ...DEVELOPERS!; oh i know, i've come accross /r/dividends before.  the level of delusion is hilarious.; I trust amazon to generate higher returns on their free cash flow than to issue a dividend.; Hey, if you have 10k worth of it, you may be able to enjoy a nice evening at the movies with that dividend!; Yes. Still in order to get X from 0.08% you would be better off investing in something as stable but pays 1.5-3% using the same amount of investment money for a far higher payout; What if you take those 10K and put it into a 2.6% payer (dividend king); What an example did you pick ;-); not true, I've put my university tuition in some stable dividend-yielding stocks and I've been getting an approximate 10% annual yield from it. If I were to have put it in a high interest savings account (5-5.5%), I would have lost a lot of additionally generated capital. ; If the business passes cash to shareholders, that is not a bad thing. 

Also, as others have pointed out, if paying a nominal dividend opens up that stock to be purchased by funds and ETF’s that can only buy dividend stocks per their strategy, it increases the possible ownership base.; but if you're going to implement a dividend, you might as well make it high enough to be meaningful, but I understand what you mean; Is it?  At the end of the day a business is worth the present value of its future dividends; > Furthermore, it doesn’t really make sense to buy back the stock if it is expensive

Nobody knows for sure at the time whether a stock is “expensive”; Yes both could generate returns but other bets hasn’t delivered value in 20 years. Search, cloud, YouTube is what has been driving the company. They’ve wasted a ton of money.; I agree.; Companies are not meant to be stock pickers - they are meant to optimize their capital structure.  They have extra capital when the company does well, which will tend to correspond to periods of higher stock prices.  When the company is doing poorly and has little free cash flow, it will tend to be a at a lower price, but it doesn't have the cash to buy back stock.  

We shouldn't want companies to hold on to cash on the speculation that its stock price will dip in the future - they should manage their balance sheets based on current conditions, and let the market value them.; also the thing Meta and Google do differently than Apple is that Apple's share count has dropped substantially since a decade ago, whilst Meta and Google's share price has stagnated because the latter two do so much dilution from stock based comp.; You’re forgetting that the companies are still growing and their stock prices will appreciate over time; You're free to reinvest the money back into the same stock, or to use it to buy some other stock that you think is a better deal.

Dividends are the best use of cash when a stock is expensive and they can't effectively reinvest it to grow their business. If a stock was trading at a 100+ PE ratio, and less then a 1% free cash flow yield and yet they were spending billions of dollars on share buybacks I'd be pretty pissed at their management for wasting that money if I were an investor.; I appreciate AMZN not having a dividend. 

However, I also see Jassy as bringing the company to profitability by cutting expenses. I see the dividend as an eventuality.; [deleted]; Do you realize how small of a dividend allows a company's inclusion into ""dividend"" Etfs?

NVIDIA paid out like 200 million (.009 cents a share) ...; You could have just sold the equivalent amount worth of stock; I think unless you have a super high capital account, you’re better off with a higher return on a stock like Nvidia or google then counting on a dividend payment on something like Ford.

I’m learning all this on my own, so maybe you can convince me  otherwise.; Then you probably get 5-7% annual increase in dividends, and after 35 years, you are earning about the same in dividends, but you have less capital appreciation on the underlying shares.; It's a bad thing if the business can generate a higher return on investment by using that cash themselves. That's why I disagree with pretty much all of the Mag7's distributions except for Apple.; Tell me you think it‘s a good idea for Microsoft to liquidate and pay out the biggest dividend of its life. Or less extreme, to cut all R&D and all capex whatsoever just to juice its dividend.

Yeah, it‘d be stupid. The point of growth is for the business to reinvest and grow its cash flows, that‘s why I‘m paying 30x earnings.; >Is it? At the end of the day a business is worth the present value of its future ~~dividends~~ cash flow; Management should have a good idea, because if not they will allocate capital poorly; Yeah, they should stop working on transformative technologies to advance our species and instead focus on making better advertisements. Alphabet needs more geniuses like yourself working there because you’re clearly smarter than all of them!; Management teams getting paid millions with the job of capital allocation should absolutely be thinking about valuation when deciding whether buybacks make sense. 

“Can you imagine somebody going out and saying, we’re going to buy a business and we don’t care what the price is? You know, we’re going to spend $5 billion this year buying a business, we don’t care what the price is. But that’s what companies do when they don’t attach some kind of a metric to what they’re doing on their buybacks.”

\- Warren Buffett; Alphabet shares outstanding have been dropping since 2018 by about 13%. That’s less than the ~25% for Apple over that time, but calling it stagnant doesn’t seem appropriate: https://m.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOGL/alphabet/shares-outstanding; They’ve been profitable since Bezos; Should go back to talking to your wife about that ¯\_(ツ)_/¯; I still think the company retaining their cash flows for reinvestment would provide a greater return than issuing a dividend for the sake of being included in a dividend ETF to be bought up.; Ah not trying to convince you, it’s all personal experience. I personally rather see some returns today than pump the stock for Nvidia CEO so that he can sell at the highest high and leave the bag for me to hold hoping one day I will become rich. Only exception if you bought NVDA when it was dirt cheap then you win anyway; Fair enough, but who can be confident enough that the growth stock with the 0.5% payer will keep growing for 35 years? Especially if the stock is probably overvalued ATM; Disagree. It doesn’t need to be one or the other. These companies are swimming in cash and can do it all. Increasing the ownership base through ETF’s is in no way bad for shareholders; Like more buybacks? Look at Google who could have easily self funded Waymo but instead they took outside investment. ; Which is paid out to shareholders how?; Other Bets has lost $40b over the past decade. Luckily the geniuses there are putting their smarts to good use.; That just isn't what I stated - they are attaching a metric to it, that's what the capital allocation decision is for - if the expected return is too low on a buyback, a company will generally issue a dividend instead; what they aren't doing is trying to bottom tick the stock price.; Perhaps the situation has improved recently. It was an article I read a few months ago, it was examining the three companies share count from 2012-2022 or 2013-2023; Let's say it's only 100 million (I think the requirement is actually lower, but I'll be generous).  2-3% of the stock market is in dividend-only ETFS.

Even a .1% increase in the stock value as a result of a new slate of Etfs buying Amazon is worth over two billion dollars to shareholders.

**You don't need to believe me ... some random guy on the internet.  Multiple mega cap companies have publicly admitted that this is why they pay out an otherwise pointlessly small dividend.; Dividends are not free money and you shouldn’t count them as “return”; Well, they probably wanted to spread the risk; Share buybacks, by reinvesting it back into the business to generate higher cash flows, etc. Either way, it's reflected in the share price. Besides, the stock price is lowered by the stock exchange on the ex-dividend date anyways. Therefore, had the company not issued a dividend, you could have sold shares/a fractional share to give yourself a dividend. It's just math and logic.; And just one of those bets is now valued at $45B and will completely transform the transportation industry. It doesn’t take a genius to see it is paying off.; Holding cash because a stock is expensive isn’t bottom ticking, it’s prudent patience. Sometimes the market does a lousy job of valuation. Here’s what Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan had to say:

”Buying back stock of a financial company greatly in excess of two times tangible book is a mistake. We aren't going to do it.""

”I've been quite clear that I think things -- the future could be quite turbulent and asset prices in my view... are inflated. I don't know if they're extremely inflated or a little bit, but I prefer to wait.”

”Cash is a very valuable asset sometimes in a turbulent world. And you see my friend Warren Buffett stockpiling cash right now. I mean, people should be a little more thoughtful about how we're trying to navigate in this world and grow for the long-term for our company.”; In the earlier 2010s Alphabet and Meta really had stagnated while Apple dropped so the difference is larger if you extend further back. It just hasn’t really been as true for the past 6-7 years.; Could be the case. I don't see why it would be beneficial for a company to get unnecessarily juiced up higher than its intrinsic value though.; I think the people running Amazon know what they're doing compared to you lol; Your argument is as known and famous as the Statue of Liberty. Depending on what type of investor you are this claim is either true or false.
I will not even try to get into this; A stock being worth the present value of its future dividends is a principle taught in Accounting 101 textbooks.  It’s universally true; lol other megacaps have made the same calculus lol some companies have executives that don't want to pay income taxes on dividends and that distorts decision-making lol; No, it literally doesn’t matter what type of investor you are. All a dividend does is move a dollar from the company’s balance sheet into your pocket. There’s no new wealth being generated so the share price drops by the amount of the dividend since the company is now worth less.

In other words, if you own one share of a stock trading at $10 and it pays you a $1 dividend, you do NOT now have $11. Instead, you own one share of the stock now worth $9, and $1 in cash. Your net worth is still $10, nothing has changed. And if this stock is in a taxable account, now you have to pay taxes on the $1 so technically your net worth actually decreased.; Where are dividends paid out of?; Amazons board of directors and management team > Overlord1317

I am curious about how the returns looked for 2022.; lost 1k on options and quit. made a couple hundo k in my long stocks; $50.; Dumb post. Thought WSB is about big losses or big wins. This is neither. Oh you beat the market slightly for one year? Clap, clap, clap.; I think the keyword missing here is *""consistency""* ![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787)

It is an objective fact most day traders are not beating annual returns of SPY, so in that comparison they're losing money; ""consistently"" or ""in the long term"" is the key part of the phrase you're missing. Everybody has the years where he's a genius outperforming the market. Now do that for 20 years, and you'll find why virtually nobody beats the market trading often for many years.; Love the optimism. Link looks interesting though. Good luck to all the winners out there making bank in '24!; 2024 was great year, could have even been better with a bit more luck. If 2025 goes half that good I'm golden, so fingers fucking crossed. But I have bad feeling for my returns this year 👀; I did aight, don't really do options yet.  Been playing around in the mining sector and have found some good companies with pretty reliable seasonal earnings, I just trade the cycle in longs.  Up 30k in 2024, plan on doubling it in 2025.; It might sounds dull, but buying stocks and holding them during bull runs is a great way to make money. Too many regards here losing all their money on options.; Cool. Underperforming bitcoin so you lost money; Couldnt be me, literally.

In another month or two you could be back below the SP500 a March-July.; what's your points then?  or are you trying to say by end of 2025, i will beat the S&P again?  haha; Compare the end result until after the last crash between consistant investing and whatever you are doing... atleast 5-10 years. That is what that statement is based upon.

Than check the time invested and then decide if its an expensive or money making hobby... it's fun either way."
Bitcoin Isn’t Unique But Infinite—$100K Is Beyond Absurd,"Imagine this: air, the most abundant and freely available resource on Earth. Everyone can breathe it without restriction, it’s everywhere, and it costs nothing. Now, imagine a company decides to package this air into bottles, claiming, “Only 21 million bottles will ever exist.” They sell the bottles, marketing them as rare and special, and soon, the price of a single bottle soars to $100,000.

But here’s the catch: anyone can grab the same air, bottle it themselves, impose their own arbitrary limits, and sell it too. The air inside these bottles is identical, same purity, same ability to sustain life. Yet somehow, the original company convinces people their air is unique, while the others are dismissed as worthless. This isn’t just absurd but comically irrational. And yet, it’s a perfect analogy for Bitcoin.

Think about it: bottling air to sell is ridiculous. Why would anyone pay for something that is freely and infinitely available? Worse, imagine dedicating an entire decentralized system—one consuming massive amounts of electricity, requiring complex networks, and involving global participants—to package, transfer, and store this bottled air. This is the level of absurdity we reach with Bitcoin.

Bitcoin’s defenders often point to its decentralization, anonymity, and capped supply of 21 million coins as reasons for its value. But what is this decentralized system really securing? Digital air. The units being produced, transferred, and protected represent nothing—they are infinitely replicable tokens that anyone can create at any time. Anyone with the technical knowledge can clone Bitcoin’s code, impose their own arbitrary cap, and launch their own cryptocurrency.

This brings us to the critical difference between Bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies) and other financial assets like stocks or fiat currencies: cryptocurrencies represent nothing and are inherently limitless.

Stocks represent ownership in a company. A company cannot be copied like a piece of code. The value of a share is tied to the performance, assets, and operations of that unique entity. You cannot clone Tesla or Apple, and therefore, you cannot duplicate the value tied to their stocks. Stocks are inherently scarce because companies themselves are finite, tied to real-world assets, operations, and innovation.

Fiat currencies, on the other hand, represent units of debt. They are issued by central banks and commercial banks through loans and bonds based on the ability of borrowers—companies, governments, or individuals—to repay them. Banks cannot create money infinitely because it is tied to the real-world capacity of debtors to meet their obligations. No one can walk into a bank and request a trillion-dollar loan without collateral or a realistic ability to repay it.

Cryptocurrencies operate under no such constraints. If you wanted to create a trillion crypto tokens tomorrow, nothing stops you. Bitcoin’s 21 million coin cap is arbitrary and meaningless because anyone can copy the Bitcoin protocol, adjust the parameters, and produce trillions of coins in their own system. In this way, cryptocurrencies represent nothing—no ownership, no debt, no tangible connection to the real economy. They are the digital equivalent of bottling air, infinitely replicable with no inherent value.

Bitcoin’s defenders argue that its capped supply makes it valuable, likening it to gold. But unlike gold, Bitcoin’s scarcity is artificial and replicable. Limiting Bitcoin to 21 million units is no different than bottling air and claiming, “We’re only producing 21 million bottles.” The air is still abundant, and anyone else can create their own bottles with their own arbitrary limits.

The absurdity deepens when you consider the massive resources dedicated to securing, transferring, and storing these digital tokens. Bitcoin mining consumes more electricity than entire nations, and yet what is being protected? A digital representation of air, something freely available, infinitely replicable, and ultimately meaningless.

Bitcoin’s price doesn’t reflect the value of its features. If decentralization, anonymity, and security were truly valuable, Bitcoin’s clones, many of which improve on these features, would share its valuation. Instead, Bitcoin’s price is fueled by speculation and the collective illusion that it is unique. People aren’t paying $100,000 because Bitcoin is the best cryptocurrency; they’re paying because they believe someone else will pay more.

This speculative bubble cannot last. Once people recognize that Bitcoin’s features are infinitely replicable, and that its competitors offer the same or better functionality at a fraction of the cost, the illusion will collapse.

Bitcoin isn’t digital gold, nor is it a revolutionary asset. It’s a digital air, packaged and sold as rare and valuable despite being infinitely and freely available. Paying $100,000 for a single Bitcoin is not a testament to its worth but evidence of a collective delusion. The elaborate decentralized system supporting Bitcoin exists to secure and transfer something that anyone can recreate endlessly at no cost.

When the hype fades, and the absurdity of the system becomes clear, Bitcoin’s price will plummet, leaving behind the inescapable truth: no rational person should pay a fortune for something as abundant and meaningless as digital air.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hqy8vw/bitcoin_isnt_unique_but_infinite100k_is_beyond/,0,2025-01-01 08:36:43,"One of the better analogies I’ve come across to counter your argument is that I could copy instragram (or another social network) tomorrow, but if nobody uses it is is worthless. 

Bitcoin has value because of the massive digital networking effect. The global consensus appears to be that people value Bitcoin as the number one digital currency / asset, and therein lies a key component of the value. 

You could argue that people might decide another digital asset should be more valuable, but to change the views of hundreds of millions of people/ possibly billions of users is akin to trying to get a supertanker to turn on a dime - it’s just extremely hard to fathom and therefore your argument does not apply. You cannot just ‘bottle other air’ and it become valuable as millions / billions of people think the original air is valuable. 

I would be interested in your counter to this value through digital networking effect argument.; If what you believe is true, then anyone could create a replacement that would achieve similar value and that just isn't happening.

What makes bitcoin unique is that it has enough participants to work as advertised and every participant chose it. It's not the default.; I feel like the same thing gets posted every 3 months for the last 10 years and nothing changes; Thank you for your unoriginal thoughts 10 years after I heard them for the first time; So, do it.

1. Download the open source Bitcoin software.
2. Change the name to what you want. 
3. Start mining it. 

See what happens.

Don't you think that if it were that easy, someone would have done it? Several attempts have been made.; ""You can't use paper for money - anyone could print that; it's intrinsically worthless!""

That was also correct at one time. Financial systems evolve, it's just that the time constants are measured in decades or centuries. Fun exercise: how many currencies exist today in their rough same form as 200 years ago -- and now, how many of those have governments that exist in the same form now as 200 years ago?  It's a small list; governments and currencies are ephemeral too with long enough time scales.; Go to bed; OP needs to study the history of money, network effects, internet protocols, computer science and encryption, precious metal stock/flow valuations, Austrian vs Keynesian economics, bitcoin itself, etc etc…. So much to do. So much to do!

They seriously think some central issuer bottling and selling air is akin to bitcoin. 😂 since this is an investment post, I sincerely hope no one takes this seriously; It costs electricity to make Bitcoin.; You sound so salty OP, if you hate it so much, why do you even care 😅, sounds like Bitcoin lives in your head rent free.; Thanks or sorry that happened!; You wrote this whole story based on your opinion and no facts.  Actually trashing BTC for no good reason from what I can see.  BTC is bulletproof, you can’t hack it or clone it as you claim.; So are Pokémon cards, but that’s not stopping kids and their dumbass parents from slurping up those nearly limitless printed trading cards.

Hell, the way 25yo kids are dropping $1000’s on Pokémon cards and even travelling to Japan to buy them makes BTC look really good in comparison.; \>This speculative bubble cannot last. Once people recognize that Bitcoin’s features are infinitely replicable

  
or once we get a real bear market. bitcoin in its speculative form has never seen one that hasn't been extremely V-shaped. when broad market indexes are down 30-70% and unemployment peaks hard what do you think magic internet money is going to be sitting at?

  
there's an absolute crap load of speculation in the market and it is not specific to crypto; Lots of very uninformed takes here, OP.

You might want to fact check yourself. You have a lot to learn about bitcoin and crypto in general.; [removed]; Bitcoin at 100k is a good time to sell, not to buy, I'm fine with that. Rest of your take is just wrong. You can create millions of company if you wanna, but none of them will replicate the value of Apple or Tesla, same with Bitcoin. You can create Bitcoin-copycat but you still need to spend an absurd amount of energy which cost shitton of real-life electricity and specialised computer to get one of those 21 million Bitcoin (or pay 100k for it) while none of your copycat will replicate the value of Bitcoin.; A useful way to test your thinking is to copy paste this into chat GPT and ask it to role play as a bitcoin proponent to counter the arguments. 

You can try even sth stronger like “don’t stop our convo until you’ve convinced me of its utility” 

Would be interested in your experience and any counter arguments to its counter arguments!; The fact that everyone measure the value of bitcoin in dollars should make you think about what they want, more bitcoin or more dollars?; I think Buffett's take on Bitcoin is perfect.  Much as you say.; [deleted]; I pretty much agree that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value (well maybe except for money laundering). But it doesn’t mean you can’t have a 3% speculative position. If it goes up, nothing to lose. If it goes down, not a big deal.; Your analogy comparing Bitcoin to social networks like Instagram is flawed because it conflates functional digital platforms with empty digital tokens.

Instagram posts and pictures aren’t empty units. They are creative outputs that hold intrinsic value to their creators and audiences. Social networks like Instagram or Facebook provide tangible value through features like communication, connection, and content sharing. Users create and consume content that enhances their personal and professional lives. This isn’t comparable to Bitcoin, which doesn’t produce anything. Its tokens don’t represent assets, creative works, or tangible utilities.

Further, social networks generate revenue, and you can invest in that revenue stream. Platforms like Instagram and Facebook make money through advertising, providing a clear business model. If you own stock in Meta you get access to dividends or share price appreciation tied to the company’s performance. Bitcoin, by contrast, has no revenue, no dividends, no underlying asset, and no utility beyond speculation. It’s an empty vessel propped up by hype and collective belief, not by any productive system.

The network effect doesn’t justify Bitcoin’s value. The so-called “massive digital networking effect” of Bitcoin doesn’t produce utility the way social networks do. Instagram’s network is valuable because users are creating content, sharing ideas, and driving engagement, which in turn attracts advertisers. Bitcoin’s network, on the other hand, exists solely to secure and trade a token that represents nothing. Its network effect is built on speculation and circular reasoning: people value Bitcoin because other people value Bitcoin. This doesn’t make it inherently valuable, it just makes it a bigger bubble.

The air analogy still holds. Even if billions of people believe Bitcoin is valuable, that doesn’t change the fact that what they’re trading is infinitely replicable digital air. The illusion of scarcity doesn’t make the underlying token any more meaningful. Bottling air and convincing people it’s unique might work temporarily, but it doesn’t change the fact that air is all around us, free and infinite.

Changing mass belief is hard, but not impossible. Markets have turned against ‘indestructible’ narratives before. Tulip mania, the South Sea Bubble, and even tech bubbles all involved massive numbers of people believing in the value of something, only for the belief to collapse when reality set in. Bitcoin is no different as its value is based on collective belief, not on any intrinsic qualities. When people start to realize this, the network effect will collapse just like any other speculative bubble.; If Bitcoin’s value truly stemmed from something unique, its adoption might make sense. But the reality is that Bitcoin isn’t special; it’s just the first cryptocurrency to gain traction. The claim that ""anyone could create a replacement"" is true and they already have. Bitcoin has been cloned countless times, and the only reason these clones don’t have the same value is that Bitcoin benefits from first-mover hype, not because it’s fundamentally different.

Participants “choosing” Bitcoin doesn’t make it unique either. It just means people latched onto the first major cryptocurrency they encountered. What they’re choosing is still digital air, tokens that represent nothing, can be copied infinitely, and offer no intrinsic value. The fact that a large network secures Bitcoin doesn’t justify wasting resources on something that’s abundant and pointless. Popularity doesn’t make absurdity rational, it just makes it widespread.; Still a pyramid scheme.; And each time with a much higher number.

And then it goes into a slump on much higher level than before, and people are like “I told you so” and then goes to a new ATH 2-3 years later. And we are for sure gonna hear the same when it is gonna slump around 2026-2027.

If you can wrong for 16 years, maybe there is so something you are missing.; It will change and people will loose lots of money. People will live saying “ I’m glad I sold at $100,000” bitcoin or any crypto isn’t real money and not backed by anything. Crypto is trash; Also just wrong. You can’t create more bitcoin without getting EVERYONE running the network to agree- good luck with that 👍; You are missing the fundamental point: just because people irrationally prefer one brand of bottled air over another doesn’t change the fact that what’s being sold is still just air.

To your points:

1)Downloading the Bitcoin code, renaming it, and starting a new network isn’t difficult. Plenty of people have done it. That’s exactly how we got countless cryptocurrencies. The fact that these clones exist proves my point: Bitcoin can be and has been replicated repeatedly.

2)The reason these clones don’t reach Bitcoin’s level of popularity isn’t because they’re fundamentally different or less secure. It’s because Bitcoin had the advantage of being the first to market, and its brand is propped up by hype, speculation, and a network effect. People irrationally cling to the idea that Bitcoin is unique, but this belief doesn’t change the fact that Bitcoin’s core features like decentralization, anonymity, and scarcity or the units themselves are infinitely replicable.

3)The idea that ‘several attempts have been made’ and failed doesn’t make Bitcoin’s system or value logical. It simply shows how strong the collective delusion around Bitcoin’s brand is. If you bottle air and convince people it’s special, and they refuse to buy from anyone else despite identical alternatives, that doesn’t make your product inherently valuable, it just highlights how irrational the buyers are.

At the end of the day, whether people buy Bitcoin or not doesn’t change the fact that what’s being secured, mined, and traded is effectively digital air, units that represent nothing. They are infinite and freely replicable via clones. It's fundamentally absurd to waste resources on something like that.; [removed]; The analogy between fiat money and Bitcoin falls apart because fiat money isn’t “intrinsically worthless” in the same way Bitcoin is. Fiat represents debt, an obligation backed by collateral, creditworthiness, and the productive capacity of individuals, companies, and governments. When a bank issues fiat currency through loans, it’s tied to real-world assets and obligations, ensuring a connection to the economy. You can’t simply “print” fiat without consequences because it’s tied to the ability of debtors to repay it.

Bitcoin, however, represents nothing. It isn’t backed by debt, collateral, or any real-world asset. Anyone can create a cryptocurrency from scratch and assign an arbitrary supply cap, but that doesn’t make it valuable. Its supposed “scarcity” is artificial because the concept can be infinitely copied.

While financial systems evolve, that evolution is tied to systems of accountability and value. Fiat currency evolved as a way to efficiently represent and exchange debt obligations tied to real assets. Bitcoin lacks this foundation entirely. Suggesting Bitcoin is comparable to fiat money overlooks the critical difference: fiat is grounded in the real debt obligations, while Bitcoin is unbacked speculation on digital air.; I have heard that its price represents the total value of the electricity that has created it. Interesting take.; Sure, it costs electricity to make Bitcoin, just like it would cost electricity to bottle, store, and transfer air. But that doesn’t make the process any less absurd. Air is all around us, freely available. Using electricity to package it into bottles doesn’t give it value but just shows how wasteful the process is.

The same applies to Bitcoin. What is being ‘created,’ ‘stored,’ and ‘transferred’ via this decentralized system is nothing but digital air, units that represent nothing, can be copied infinitely via clones and are no different from countless crypto units anyone can make.; [removed]; When broad market indexes are down 30-70% I will sell my semen for ETFs; Bitcoin has never seen a real bear market?; if i had the energy to edit this, id also comment the following statement “sorry for your loss”

it’s clear this was written out of spite. 

happy new year, loser.; The comparison between Bitcoin and companies like Apple or Tesla is flawed because it ignores the fundamental difference: companies produce goods and services, while Bitcoin is just an empty digital token.

Companies like Apple and Tesla create value through innovation, tangible products, and real-world economic impact. Their stocks represent ownership in a business that generates revenue and profit. This value can’t be easily replicated because the companies are backed by patents, infrastructure, and a workforce that can’t be copy-pasted.

Bitcoin, on the other hand, produces nothing. Its value isn’t tied to any utility or economic output. It’s purely speculative. Yes, it costs electricity to mine Bitcoin, but burning energy to create something doesn’t automatically make it valuable. If you spend a fortune mining digital air, all you have is expensive digital air. Bitcoin’s value doesn’t come from its energy consumption; it comes from people speculating that others will pay more for it later.

As for your point about copycats, Bitcoin clones already exist but their lack of adoption only highlights how irrational the market is, not Bitcoin’s uniqueness. Just because people irrationally value one brand of bottled air over others doesn’t change the fact that what’s being bought and sold is still just air. Bitcoin isn’t a productive asset, it’s a bubble, and the fact that it costs a lot to mine doesn’t make it any less absurd.; Gold used to be sold in salt, until everyone learned that it was a better store of value. We measure it in usd because it is what everyone else still believes is the best store of value. Might I recommend ""Shelling Out"" by Nick Szabo?; I actually track my networth in dollar and in btc . The sad reality is while I double it in 3 years in dollars, I got poorer in bitcoin.; [Naval in 2017](https://x.com/naval/status/939316447318122496?t=IXQApdb8Y2m4_RJeXDv89g&s=19); Beauty.; We build rockets to go into space while people in north America don't have drinking water or a roof over their head and billionaires who don't pay taxes.

But adding ""real"" allows for the poster to move the goalposts if they're pressed about it.; correct. 2018 2020 and 2022 were all extremely v shaped recoveries, nothing remotely long if you look at similar poor market conditions historically; Not really no. QE kicked the can on the 2020 crash; Bitcoin blockchain produce expensive block where place to write data that are protected against any change is sold. What's priced is its security amd integrity. You cannot overwrite on the Bitcoin blockchain without spending a tons in material and energy. Other Bitcoin copycat weren't able to produce that level of security and integrity, which is part of its uniqueness. 

The data being written is mostly financial data (transaction). The aim of Bitcoin is to be a decentralized ledger, which is working as intended for the past 15 years. A whole ecosystem is being born from that piece of code: some merchants allow payment in crypto, it's used as legal tender in some 3rd world country, etc.

The only other cryptocurrency that are able to compete against Bitcoin, like Ethereum, have another aim than being a decentralized ledger, its to be a decentralized computer. 

It's absurdily priced up, especially in a bullmarket, and extremly unregulated (some token acts as shares of a company), but thinking it's completly worthless is also absurd too.; It can be said about anything. Even the S&P500, even though it has +100 years to back it up. Could enter WW3, very unlikely, but not impossible. Everything will come to at end at some point, even the S&P500.; The claim that Bitcoin’s value is tied to its security and liquidity is true on the surface, but it ignores the underlying absurdity: what is being secured and transacted is fundamentally meaningless. Let’s address your points systematically.

The argument that clones are worthless because they’re not decentralized or secure misses the bigger picture. Bitcoin’s decentralization and security protect nothing more than an entry in a ledger that tracks ownership of digital tokens. These tokens represent no real-world asset, no debt, no claim on productivity. It's just speculative value. Spending billions annually to secure something inherently worthless doesn’t make it valuable; it makes the system an extravagant waste of resources.

As for the comparison to payment networks like PayPal, Amex, or MasterCard, the distinction is clear: those systems facilitate transactions of fiat money, which is tied to real-world economies and debt. Bitcoin’s blockspace is used to transfer Bitcoin, a token that represents nothing. Settling billions of dollars in speculative value doesn’t create inherent worth. It's just a reflection of speculative trading volume, not economic utility.

The idea that no one uses clones because Bitcoin has all the liquidity and trading volume highlights a self-reinforcing bubble, not intrinsic value. Liquidity and trading volume exist because people speculate on Bitcoin, not because it provides superior utility or represents something valuable. The argument essentially boils down to popularity, which is not the same as legitimacy.

Finally, comparing Bitcoin’s market dominance to traditional businesses failing is flawed. In traditional finance, businesses fail because they can’t compete on innovation, efficiency, or value creation. In the crypto space, clones fail not because they’re less innovative or useful but because Bitcoin benefits from first-mover advantage and irrational speculation. The fact that people irrationally cling to the first brand of “digital air” doesn’t make Bitcoin more valid, but just makes the market collectively deluded.

Bitcoin’s supposed security and decentralization don’t justify its price because what’s being secured and decentralized is no more valuable than an infinite supply of digital air. The billions paid for blockspace reflect hype, not utility.; You are correct.; Your argument rests on the premise that Bitcoin’s security and integrity justify its price, but this misses the point: what’s being secured and stored on the blockchain is fundamentally worthless.

The Bitcoin blockchain is indeed secure and decentralized, but its main purpose is to protect data about transactions involving Bitcoin itself. Essentially, an elaborate system for keeping track of who owns a digital token that represents nothing. The blockchain’s immutability is impressive from a technical perspective, but it doesn’t add inherent value to the thing being tracked. It’s like spending a fortune on an unbreakable safe to protect an empty box.

The claim that Bitcoin’s uniqueness lies in its security also doesn’t hold up. Other cryptocurrencies have built blockchains with comparable or even superior levels of functionality and adoption, depending on the use case. Bitcoin’s so-called “uniqueness” is more a function of being first to market than offering unparalleled features.

As for its use as a decentralized ledger, the fact that Bitcoin has been working as intended for 15 years doesn’t mean it’s inherently valuable. A system can function perfectly while still solving a problem that doesn’t need solving. The idea of a decentralized ledger sounds appealing until you consider the inefficiency and absurdity of expending massive amounts of energy to protect a system that tracks digital tokens with no intrinsic worth.

Yes, Bitcoin has spawned an ecosystem, but much of it is speculative or based on the illusion of utility. Its use as legal tender in some countries is more about political posturing than practicality, as adoption rates remain low and most people still rely on fiat currencies.

Ultimately, Bitcoin’s price doesn’t stem from its security, utility, or decentralization. It’s driven by speculation and belief in its value. While it’s not ""completely worthless"" as a technology, its current valuation is detached from any meaningful economic utility. Bitcoin secures digital air, and no amount of energy consumption or technical brilliance changes that fact.; And the S&P500 consisted of completely different companies back then; They are speculating on the ""potential"" of the next big thing. If it wasn't crypto it would  be something else.; Yup, the whole US economy has to sink and never recover. Very very unlikely, but nothing is impossible.; That's not true for bitcoin, though.

Best AI stocks to invest in 2025,"Hello

I am new to stock market and was wondering what AI stocks are a better investment?NVDA and AMAZON is something I have invested a bit.But was wondering if it makes sense to put more into it or are there any other stocks out there which makes more sense to invest in. Was also thinking MS and Apple but I am not sure if they have already reached their limits and not really sure what 2025 has for these. NVDA exploded in 2024 and not sure how that can contribute for 2025. Never really been a favorite of Alphabet and Meta is very expensive. I am asking for advice keeping the next 3 years in mind for now. Any expert insights is much appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1hqo2oy/best_ai_stocks_to_invest_in_2025/,46,2024-12-31 22:07:58,"I would look at NVDA, AMD, GOOG, META, AMZN, and MSFT. 

My thesis is that when AI starts to explode, it’s going to be the mega caps that end up stealing the spotlight.; This is an easy one.   The company that will most likely win the AI wars and benefit is Google.


Search will go to agents and there is nobody better positioned than Google to win the agent space.

There is no company that has anywhere near the reach that Google enjoys.

Take cars. Google now has the largest car maker in the world, VW, GM, Ford, Honda a bunch of others ones now using Android Automotive as their vehicle OS. Do not confuse this with Android Auto. Google will just put Astra in all these cars. Compare this to OpenAI that has zero access to automobiles.

Same story with TVs. Google has Hisense, TCL, Samsung and a bunch of other TV manufactures using Google TV as their TV OS. Google will have all these TVs get Astra. Compare this to OpenAI that has zero on TVs.

Then there is phones. The most popular OS in the world is Android. Google has over 3 billion active devices running Android and they will offer Astra on all of these phones. Compare this to OpenAI that does not even have a phone operating system.

Then there is Chrome. The most popular browser. Compare this to OpenAI that does not have a browser. Google will be offering Astra built into Chrome.

But that is really only half the story. The other is Google has the most popular applications people use and those will be fully integrated into Astra.

So you are driving and Astra will realize you are close to being out of gas and will tap into Google Maps to give you the gas station ad right at the moment you most need it. Google will also integrate all their other popular apps like Photos, YouTube, Gmail, etc.

Even new things like the new Samsung Glasses are coming with Google Gemini/Astra built in.

There just was never really a chance for OpenAI. Google has basically built the company for all of this and done the investment to win the space.

The big question is what Apple will ultimately do? They are just not built to provide this technology themselves.

I believe that Apple at some point will just do a deal with Google where they share in the revenue generated by Astra/Gemini from iOS devices. Same thing they are doing with the car makers and TV makers.

They will need to because of how many popular applications Google has.

Astra will also be insanely profitable for Google. There is so many more revenue generation opportunities with an Agent than there is with just search.

BTW, it will also be incredibly sticky. Once your agent knows you there is little chance you are going to switch to a different one. This is why first mover is so important with the agent and why Google is making sure they are out in front with this technology.

Plus the agent is going to know you far better than anything there is today so the ads will also be a lot more valuable for Google.

The other thing that Google did that helps assure the win is spending the billions on the TPUs starting over a decade ago. Google is not stuck paying the massive Nvidia tax that OpenAI is stuck paying. Plus Google does not have to wait in the Nvidia line.

That is how Google can offer things like Veo2 for free versus OpenAI Sora

https://www.reddit.com/link/1hg6868/video/sopmwriocd7e1/player?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=OpenAI&utm_content=t3_1hg6868

Or how Google is able to offer Gemini Flash 2.0 for free. But this is a very common MO for Google. They offer this stuff for free and suck out all the money and hurt investment into competitors. Then once the competition is gone Google will bump up the ads and/or subscription price. Plus the fact that people are not going to want to switch Agents it will also allow Google to bump up the ads without losing material customers.

The other place Google just blows OpenAI away is in terms of research. Last NeurIPS Google had twice the papers accepted as next best.

Plus next best was NOT OpenAI. Google has led in papers accepted every single year over the last 10+ years.

Most years Google has been #1 and #2 as they use to breakout Deepmind from Google Brain.

OpenAI has NOT even registered and not been in the top 5 a single year.; It would be foolish to overlook Google.; NBIS - Nebius group; Less risky
- AMD
- NVDA
- MFST
- GOOG
- AMZN

These companies already have some things going, so they arent as risky. If you want lower risk, these could fit.

More risky
- SOUN
- AISP

SOUN and AISP are pretty good for short term trading, but they are still longterm candidates. If you want higher risk and more volatility, these stocks could work for you. These stocks are high risk high reward.; Might unironically be shorting them next year, though I am bullish long term; BBAI - I see them somewhat of a little brother of PLTR. BigBear AI have similar offerings to Palantir but are more specialised towards Cybersecurity, Border Control and Supply Chain logistics.

Recently, they've had a bit of a run up so I'm expecting them to drop before purchasing more.; Two of my favorites honestly in Amazon and NVidia.  Nvidia grows faster and will through the end of 2026 for sure.  Amazon is steady but solid growth.  Both dominate their spaces.  NVDA is a very solid investment or trade until next earnings; APLD is a hidden gem I found that builds datacenter and infrastructure for AI development. They are the contractor that get hired to design and construct data centers. I work for a top 10 ENR contractor and we collaborate a lot. Expecting them to get big once the demand for AI and data center rise even more.; NASDAQ? 😁; AVGO; INOD; INTC IS NOT AI 🤖???; AMD and Sound; Small caps.  I’m worried the overall SP500 is overvalued.  But fuck there’s no good small cap ai stock…; Sound hound daddy; BBAI and AISP; Qualcomm; AI takes extreme amounts of energy to operate. Theres not enough infrastructure to power all these new AI platforms coming online.So make sure if you invest in an AI company’s that have partnered with energy companys.   Ex:Stocks . Built data centers next to and made agreement with energy producers. They are not going to shut down the grid for any AI company who does not have the infrastructure built.  Thats my opinion.; I think price is not matter in this industry.
Relly important thing is what it really make money and growth.

so, NVDA TSLA GOOG MSFT AMZN are good chice for next 3 years. Because you really need considering about downside risk as much as upside potential.; BBAI, the Palantir baby.
Still cheap and at the right time ; ASML anyone? Monopoly semiconductor equipment play; AMD, Meta, Google, Clov, Odd are undervalued; NVIDIA is a great company and will continue to make excellent profits ..but at the size it is, it would take a looong time for it to make another 100% from current price.

AI companies make a so good year, it's difficult for me to believe they can make a 3rd year with the same performance, that would be crazy. When i watch cybersecurity stock, Chipset stock, data center stock, theyu did all betwen +40% and +150% in 2024. But the earning were not so high ...Just look the earning of Apple.; Sound hound is huge!! I’ve already doubled my money; My honest opinion is that AI stocks are the same as car companies in the last decade in the 20’s and 30’s and .com companies in 2000, they already did explode, i am waiting for them to implode and then i will get in.

Most reputable companies are overvalued.; It’s simple, AI is powered by GPUs, whoever has the biggest clusters wins. These GPUs are very expensive and hard to obtain. Only the institutes with the most capital to burn will lead the AI race. The companies that will lead are the companies that have a lot of data at hand for training and is actively investing a lot into AI research now. 

Some companies I can think of that meets this category includes: Tesla, Meta, Google, Microsoft, Amazon 

If you want to tackle AI through the supply route some companies are: Nvidia, AMD, TSMC, ASML

Personally, I think the company with the biggest unrealised potential in AI is Tesla since their focus is automation. If there’s one company that can achieve that it’s probably Tesla with its abundance in visual training data and largest GPU cluster (Colossus). If you believe in a future with humanoid robots and driverless cars then it will be a great company to own for the long term.; Look at PLTR, too.; Personally, I would avoid AI stocks since it is today's hot stocks in a very competitive industry; Poet overlooked hardware company; $RZLV, $BBAI, $AISP, $LTRX; Grrr gorilla tech; I seriously don’t understand AI.

Perfectly positioned and resourced. Will probably just stick with the Nasdaq 100 though, in case someone unexpected does a Nvidia.; Are all these too expensive to buy into right now?; Not really; they make good hardware, but have historically moved glacially when it comes to implementing new features. 

Don’t get me wrong, I like them, and (happily!) own many of their products—but I don’t think they are an AI play in the same way the other companies are moving.; Not sure the percent.  There will be so much running through Google I suspect 15% will be too much.

I was thinking a very, very little percent.  Something less than 5%.; There are some that think OpenAI is a big competitor to Google.  I do not really see it but it is why I used OpenAI in comparison.

IMO, it really breaks down to consumer and enterprise.  Google will own consumer and Microsoft will continue to own enterprise.

In the end it is all about reach.  Nobody has anywhere near the reach Google enjoys with consumers.   #2 behind Google would be Apple.

With enterprise there is nobody with the reach Microsoft enjoys.; Anything below 200 is a good price, can easily go 300+ in the near future imo. Once AI gets more fully implemented and monetized it can lead to substantial profitability and justify a valuation of 500+; INTC is a comeback.

I see it's long term chart it's starting to come off the rail; Exactly, business as usual; Nvidia is very volatile i can easily drop too 100$ its deffo a buy at that price. Also you can look into asml; Personally i wouldnt invest into nvidia right now, amazon isnt cheap either but i think they could profit big from AI.

Money Market Fund verses High Yield Savings Account,"As the title suggests, I am looking at the differences between HYSA and a money market for storing my savings. I recently acquired $5,500 from selling one of my cars and want to put that in savings but logistically what is the most practical option in case I need to pull out the money in the event of emergencies or whatever the case maybe if I need access to the funds quick. I do have a Schwab account and the ability to get a HYSA via my Apple Card. Or if there are other alternatives, I am open to them. Thanks! ",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hqimmw/money_market_fund_verses_high_yield_savings/,6,2024-12-31 17:46:30,"The downside to Schwab is there will be a slight delay in getting your money.  Unlike Fidelity and Schwab, your cash is going to be held in a sweep account that gets practically no interest.  If you want to put your savings in a money market account then the timing is exactly the same as any other mutual fund - you can only deposit and withdraw at the end of a business day.; If the situation you are planning for is the possibility of needing the funds same day, stick with a savings account.  If you are comfortable with a part of it being available in a day, put that part in a money market fund.; If you pay everything with a credit card for rewards, then pay it off at the end of the month.

Most “emergencies” can be paid for with credit and that gives you time to make the transfers. Even HYSA’s have a 2-5 day transfer window; Vanguard’s VMFXX or VMRXX; Think about how fast you might need the money. HYSAs usually sit around 3.50-5%% APY with no minimums or fees, which makes them easy to manage. Check out [sites that list savings account rates](https://banktruth.org/savings/?ttcid=online-savings-by-apy) to keep tabs on current HYSA rates. They stay updated, and it's quicker than digging through individual bank websites. Money market funds might give you a little more, but the catch is you can only access the money at the end of the business day. If you need the cash right away, an HYSA is probably the safer bet. Transfers can still take a few days, so having a credit card for emergencies can help cover things while the money moves.; If I decide to switch to a money market, which one should I go with?; If I go with a money market, which one would be best? I reside in Texas with no state income tax; What’s the difference between them; Depends on your state income tax situation.  If it's on the high side then SNSXX is the best for that - it's pretty much all treasuries, so the interest will be exempt from state and local taxes.  

That being said, if 5500 is all you're putting in then you're looking at 200-250 dollars in interest, so it's not that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things.; Vanguard’s “sweep”  account (like an in/out buffer) stores funds in VMFXX, which is paying 4.4% (7 day yield).  I’ve moved a chunk to VMRXX since it’s paying 4.42%, but it takes an extra day to access that money.  I can have any of the money into my linked bank account in 2-3 work days; I reside in Texas"
DCA into SPY by selling puts? 250k never traded options before.,"Hi guys, I will try to give context to my whole situation while also keeping it brief.

After all income minus expenses (mortgage, other) I have a surplus of about 2-3k a month that I just collect in my bank. For the past few years it was just rotting in my BOA account, but recently I moved it to Robinhood so it atleast gets 4% now.

A few years ago I put 50k in GTE, sold it when it hit 65k. Had to pay taxes on the 15k. Then put the 65k into SDC. DCA’d when stock fell in half and put in another 50k. SDC went bankrupt so I lost 115k. Would be nice if I could tax harvest it some how.

Also this whole time I was not putting any money into 401k or Roth. A month ago filled up my Roth for the Robinhood bonus, and will deposit another 7k in a few days. And a few days ago I finally went to my HR portal and enabled max 401k. Why it took me this long, I don’t know.

Anyways, I already made every possible financial mistake, so I was just trying to make the final biggest one of all. Timing the market. That is why I let my savings balloon to 250k (even after the SDC loss) .

But I just read somewhere that selling puts of SPY is like DCA’ing plus you also get paid a premium.

As you can see, I am very financially illiterate, I’ve never traded options before, although I do have a Robinhood account, and I’m smart enough to know how to have a good job that pay wells. Can someone help me walk through this?

I understand that when I enter a contract to sell puts, I buy 100 shares of that stock at the current price. If the shares go up I am mandated to sell these shares at that price I bought them, and the buyer can take those shares and instantly sell them for the higher price. 

If the stock goes down however, than my option expires worthless, but I don’t care because I was hoping for that to happen if my goal was to DCA into SPY. I already bought the 100 shares. I just got paid the premium for giving someone an option to speculate on them.

I have a couple of questions, first when doing this option, is there a particularly security to choose? Like SPY or VOO or SPLG or just the stocks I want to invest in like, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google.

For example, I noticed SPY has a ton of dates for selling puts, whereas SPLG only has 5 possible dates, roughly 2-3 months apart.

My goal is to maximize bid price right? The lower you try to sell the put for, usually the lower the bid price. 
Also if I try to sell a put that expires in a few days, usually the bid price is a few dollars. A month away, it goes up to $10. But two months away, it doesn’t double to $20, it goes to around $12-$14. So that is why the most optimal puts are to buy the ones that are a month away. Because you collect the premium and can choose to invest into selling more puts again more quickly (if stock went up).

Should I try to care about limit order or market order?

Right now I’m looking at SPY, the current price is $588.70, and there is a put for $588 on Feb 21st with a bid price of $10.21

So irregardless, I make $1,021. If stock goes down, I was planning to DCA into SPY, so now I own 100 shares. If stock goes up, someone else makes more money. Since I have 250k, I can do this trade 4 times, and at the end of February, I either have 250k plus 4k, or I have 400 shares of SPY

I guess now the question becomes how do I maximize the bid price while not doing something crazy? What is the best strategy for this?

Plus I kinda do still believe in timing the market a little. I feel like there might be a sharp drop around end of Jan (Trump) and then we will probably trend downwards or sideways for a year or so. I’m curious if you guys agree or disagree or what are your market predictions. I feel like recession sentiment is growing, but I don't know how that correlates to an actual recession.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hqiahm/dca_into_spy_by_selling_puts_250k_never_traded/,0,2024-12-31 17:30:46,"Stop. you’re doing it again.

Here is one study that compares put write indices to just the indices. Performance is comparable but lower standard deviation so supposedly lower risk. However, since performance is similar that means you're doing all that work to make no additional money. In addition, the premium you make will be taxed as short term capital gains, which means higher tax payment. I assume this also assumed optimal put writing with no mistakes, but because you're a beginner, mistakes are bound to happen so your return will be less.

  
Since it doesn't outperform most of the time, just invest in the index and call it a day.; Please just buy SPY or VTI and don’t play with options. Your description seems like you’re confusing what to do when you sell cash secured puts vs covered calls. Just buy shares and let it grow over time.; You are overcomplicating this, my man.

If the shares go up I am mandated to sell these shares at that price I bought them, and the buyer can take those shares and instantly sell them for the higher price.

You're getting things mixed up a bit. By your title, you're talking about selling cash-secured puts. You agree to buy the stock at a certain price a certain time in the future. If the stock goes *down*, the person who bought the put will exercise it and sell the stock to you for more than it's currently worth.

This quote of yours is describing a covered *call*. You own the stock (or buy it for this purpose) and agree to sell it at a certain price/date. If the stock goes up, then the person who bought the call gets to buy the stock from you for less than it's worth.

Selling options is much less risky than buying them, as long as they're covered options (you have the cash to buy the underlying if you're selling puts and already own the stock you'd be selling if you're selling calls).

The primary risk with CSPs in the way you describe is if the stock rises in price above what you would've been happy to pay for it. You've likely made a small premium selling the put but don't own the stock and have then missed the more considerable price appreciation you would've enjoyed from simply buying it originally.; I don't think you fully understand the damage you are doing (and have already done) to your financial future. 

You say you invested $165K in 2 stocks, for a net loss of of $100K (not including taxes obviously). But do you know the *true* cost of that decision?

Let's say you had invested that $165K in the S&P 500 for 30 years and left it alone. Do you know how much money you'd have? Approximately $1.25 million (assuming an average annual return of 7%). 

Your gambling cost future you $1.25 MILLION. 

\---

Now, let's say you don't learn your lesson and end up blowing this $250K as well. Let's play out that scenario. 

  
$250K  invested in the S&P 500 + a monthly contribution of the $2K you say you have leftover each month = about $4.1 million after 30 years. 

  
YOU'D HAVE OVER $4 MILLION IN 30 YEARS IF YOU JUST BOUGHT SPY/VOO AND LEFT IT ALONE FOR DECADES.

"Looking for Advice on investing USD $12,500","
Hi all,
I’m kind of new to stock market investing and need some advice.
I got $12,500 after tax bonus from work last week and am researching how & where to invest. 
Some details on my thinking are:
- Investment period 15 years
- US only investment, I know foreign markets have high growth potential but they have a lot of unpredictability which I’m not comfortable with.
- I would prefer more stable stocks like Amazon, Apple etc. but I am afraid I’m not looking at higher growth prospects. 
- My objective is to build a retirement portfolio, hence the 14 year period so value growth and dividend are both important.

The way they work is as a stock grows in value it rebalances to buy more of that stock - in effect buying high. 

When the stock drops in value it rebalances to sell that stock - in effect selling low. This is why I don't like indexes personally.

Then a pretty big gap until you get to #2.

The reason is because Google has been basically been built since day 1 for what is possible today.

With much of what is possible today thanks to Google.

Just think of Google compared to OpenAI for example.

Search will go to agents and there is nobody better positioned than Google to win the agent space.

There is no company that has anywhere near the reach that Google enjoys.

Take cars. Google now has the largest car maker in the world, VW, GM, Ford, Honda a bunch of others ones now using Android Automotive as their vehicle OS. Do not confuse this with Android Auto. Google will just put Astra in all these cars. Compare this to OpenAI that has zero access to automobiles.

Same story with TVs. Google has Hisense, TCL, Samsung and a bunch of other TV manufactures using Google TV as their TV OS. Google will have all these TVs get Astra. Compare this to OpenAI that has zero on TVs.

Then there is phones. The most popular OS in the world is Android. Google has over 3 billion active devices running Android and they will offer Astra on all of these phones. Compare this to OpenAI that does not even have a phone operating system.

Then there is Chrome. The most popular browser. Compare this to OpenAI that does not have a browser. Google will be offering Astra built into Chrome.

But that is really only half the story. The other is Google has the most popular applications people use and those will be fully integrated into Astra.

So you are driving and Astra will realize you are close to being out of gas and will tap into Google Maps to give you the gas station ad right at the moment you most need it. Google will also integrate all their other popular apps like Photos, YouTube, Gmail, etc.

Even new things like the new Samsung Glasses are coming with Google Gemini/Astra built in.

There just was never really a chance for OpenAI. Google has basically built the company for all of this and done the investment to win the space.

The big question is what Apple will ultimately do? They are just not built to provide this technology themselves.

I believe that Apple at some point will just do a deal with Google where they share in the revenue generated by Astra/Gemini from iOS devices. Same thing they are doing with the car makers and TV makers.

They will need to because of how many popular applications Google has.

Astra will also be insanely profitable for Google. There is so many more revenue generation opportunities with an Agent than there is with just search.

BTW, it will also be incredibly sticky. Once your agent knows you there is little chance you are going to switch to a different one. This is why first mover is so important with the agent and why Google is making sure they are out in front with this technology.

Plus the agent is going to know you far better than anything there is today so the ads will also be a lot more valuable for Google.

The other thing that Google did that helps assure the win is spending the billions on the TPUs starting over a decade ago. Google is not stuck paying the massive Nvidia tax that OpenAI is stuck paying. Plus Google does not have to wait in the Nvidia line.

That is how Google can offer things like Veo2 for free versus OpenAI Sora

Or how Google is able to offer Gemini Flash 2.0 for free. But this is a very common MO for Google. They offer this stuff for free and suck out all the money and hurt investment into competitors. Then once the competition is gone Google will bump up the ads and/or subscription price. Plus the fact that people are not going to want to switch Agents it will also allow Google to bump up the ads without losing material customers.; Wedbush should probably consider gardening and touching grass.

I’m a bit worried; Odd take.  MSFT is a AI pure play?   Do not think so.

The #1 on the list, easily, is Alphabet.   They have basically built the company from the ground up for today.

They are the only one with the entire stack.   Google was just brilliant to have built the TPUs over a decade ago.  The head scratcher is how Microsoft could have missed it so badly.  It was not like Google did the TPUs in secret.

Google just has had far better vision than Microsoft.   But what sets Google apart is not just being the leader in AI.   But that with their unmatched reach.

Google has far more reach than any other company on the planet.  They are in cars with Android Automotive.  They have the largest car maker in the world, VW.  Then Ford, GM, Honda and a bunch of other ones.

They have TVs.  Google TV now comes installed in TCL, HiSense, Sony and a bunch of other ones.  Literally millions and millions of TVs ship with Google inside.

Android is the most popular mobile OS by far.   With over 3 billion active devices.  Then Google has Chrome the most popular browser by far.

But it is not just the devices.  But then Google has the most popular applications which will all be integrated into Astra.

Google is going to put their agent, Astra, on everything.  TVs, Cars, Phones, Browsers, etc.   They will integrate it with YouTube, Maps, Photos, Gmail, etc.

So you will be driving down the road and Astra will know you are close to being out of gas and you will right at the perfect moment get an ad for a gas station by taping into Google Maps.

Plus the agent will be incredibly sticky.  Once it gets to know you there is zero chance you will switch to another.   Plus it will be insanely profitable.  There is so many more revenue opportunities with an Agent versus just search.

Switching to Long Term Investing,"Hello Everyone - (33m) looking for some financial input. I recently bought a house and am looking to now dive deeper into the stock market and long term investing. Over the past few years I’ve kept a lot of money in a money market account and the interest has done quite well, though I know the stock market would have yielded better results. I’ve always had low risk tolerance and I believe it’s because I’ve worked hard to get to where I am and would have to see me lose that. Here’s where I’m at today:

Outside of retirement investment accounts I will be moving $200,000 into the stock market. My initial thought was to go into a mix of the following:

75% - Vanguard Funds (VOO, VTI, VFIAX, VIG)
20% - Apple, Google, Amazon
5% - TSM and other stocks that may not have the most “safety” to them but has a good upside for the future

Is there any advice you could give me in the position I am in?

Thank you ",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hqe7m4/switching_to_long_term_investing/,3,2024-12-31 14:00:04,"Reading some of your conversations here, it seems to me that you might really enjoy reading about the Boglehead investing philosophy (named after the Vanguard founder, John Bogle).   There is a Boglehead subreddit that is worth checking out.

Investing in this style is pretty simple and it has a great track record.   It is very well suited for people who have lower/moderate risk tolerance and who want to invest with a long term buy and hold strategy (ie, it's not a get rich quick strategy).   

Basically such a portfolio would consist of a US stock component, an optional international stock component, and a bond component (this is the part that mitigates volatility/risk at the expense of the highest possible returns).    

First you would consider your stock allocation (US/foreign).   A good reasonable starting point is 80/20.   US market funds to consider (pick 1!):  VOO, VTI, FXAIX, FSKAX.    

Foreign stock market funds (funds containing the world's stocks, minus the US): VXUS, or FTIHX.   

Then consider what kind of bond fund you might want (or you could just buy individual bonds).   Typical bond funds people would recommend are BND, or FXNAX.   

So you would have your 80/20 stock portion, and then you would want to consider your stock/bond allocation.   At your age, and given a long time horizon, it's perfectly reasonable to also do 80/20 stocks/bonds.   You would increase your bond allocation over time as you get closer to retirement (you might end up at the commonly recommended 60/40 stock/bond setup... or if you are truly risk averse, you may go even higher on the bonds).

The beauty of this portfolio is that it can consist of 2 or 3 funds.   That is elegance and simplicity.   

A sample portfolio for your age might be:  Stocks: 80% of portfolio, bonds 20% of portfolio.

Stock portion: 80% VOO, 20% VXUS.   (80% US stock, 20% international)

Bond portion: BND.

That is 3 funds.   Easy Pleasy!   As you get nearer to retirement, gradually kick up the bond portion to closer to 40% of your total portfolio.    



Things you want to research to do something like this (make sure you can make a reasonable argument for whatever answer you settle on):

S&P500 or US total market fund? (this one is actually pretty easy: it doesn't matter, but read about it anyway).   

Do I need international stocks or should I go US only?   (This one sparks serious debate; make sure you understand the arguments).

Do I need bonds, and if so, how much, % wise?; >Is there any advice you could give me in the position I am in?

You're going to see red days.  And you're going to have to become comfortable with it.  No one always sees green days.  It's one thing to say you are ok with red days, and it's quite another to live them, especially when you are aware you have a low risk tolerance.  If you truly are in it for the long term (10+ years), then you need to become comfortable going to a stock chart for VOO or VTI or VT or whatever, and zooming it out to its max duration and looking at that trend up.  That is your backbone.  That is your rationale for the red days, and you stick with your plan.; > 75% - Vanguard Funds (VOO, VTI, VFIAX, VIG)

Why both VOO and VFIAX? They're effectively the same thing.

> 20% - Apple, Google, Amazon

Why? Especially if they'll be part of a fund.

> 5% - TSM and other stocks that may not have the most “safety” to them but has a good upside for the future

Is it that you think TSM specifically has a good upside for the future? Or semiconductors in general? If the latter, why not invest in a semiconductor-focused fund?; The phrase in your post that catches my attention is ""I've always had a low risk tolerance..."". Dalbar has found that in general investors tend to underperform their chosen mutual funds, mostly due to bailing out when times get tough. Is this you? I have no way of knowing. Unless you've actually held stocks through a raging bear market you have no way of knowing either. If you're not 100% certain that you can sit through a protracted period of 50% losses (or worse) and feel somewhat ambivalent about it then you should consider a healthy allocation to bonds and cash.; Stock market will be higher volatility due higher expected return. Me personally, I had to read and understand Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises by ray dalio and read stress test to be comfortable to be ready for corrections and bear markets.; All the single stocks you pointed out, you already have in VOO.  Id move that 20% you want to invest to total international market. Such as FIVA or VXUS; Beware of false diversification. VOO, VTI, VFIAX, maybe VIG, Apple, Google, Amazon - all have a ton of overlap. Even without buying Apple, Google, Amazon you'll still be at like 4%-7% of your portfolio being each of those.

It's also not correct to assume your picks will have a better upside. They might, but expectations of future growth are already priced into these stocks - they'd have to surprise the market to have a better-than-market growth. Picking individual stocks ~5% of portfolio is fun and cool, just know that it's further concentrating your portfolio with those picks.

Consider going 15%-30% international equities - both developed and emerging markets. You can grab an ETF for each and maybe pick a few for some specific countries if you want. This is so you have some assets in your portfolio that are not 100% correlated to the US market which means if one of them dips and the other didn't, you can sell some of the better-performing asset to buy more of the dipped asset which should then experience better-than-average returns during the recovery. There are options other than international / equities for this type of diversification / portfolio balancing.

But I think you got a general handle on it, you'll be good if you go with your plan I just think there's room for a little risk optimization per the above.; Just go with a 500 fund or a growth fund. It includes heavily the big 7.

Advice...never sell or panic. If you look at the 500 historically we have a loss year every 2-5 years. It has always come back, and just DCA into the funds to buy the dip.; A lot of overlapping stocks ....; Call Fidelity. Have them invest it for you. You will mess up. Your emotions need to be managed. Contribute weekly to their managed account. Good luck!; I really appreciate you taking the time to share this knowledge as it provides me good insight into a simple understanding of long term investment strategy. Thank you again. This seems like the option best suited for me. I will research the portions you recommended.; Thank you! I definitely know that I must be ok with the downfalls and for me the way I feel more comfortable with that is by going heavily into the vanguard funds knowing that it essentially mirrors the S&P 500 and long term that should be a safe route.; Hey thanks for the feedback! I was trying to understand the correlation between VFIAX and VOO a bit better. Seems VFIAX has some sort of small fee associated with it as well as a minimum investment amount? 

My reasoning for also choosing apple, Google and Amazon outside of the mutual funds was because I feel they’re very strong companies that have some higher upside individually than the full fund.

In terms of TSM it was a company that I see come up a lot when listening to some financial podcasts. I’m not necessarily well versed in the semi conductor world.; Some exposure I’ve had here is the middle of the last presidency. I had gone into more individual stock companies that took a pretty big hit. I held until my portfolio came back to its original number and then pulled everything out to rebalance. Mind you this was only a small sample size of $25,000 but they were companies like Uber, Alibaba, Delta, Carnival Cruise Line, AT&T.; Thank you!; All makes a ton of sense, thanks for clarifying the piece of glass diversification and the idea around diversifying into international markets.; What do their fees look like? My concern is they don’t have a real connection to my money like I do. I know they’re obviously a strong financial institution but still at the end of the day if they lose my money they’ll still sleep at night.; Happy to help!   Lots of far more knowledgeable folks than I on the Bogleheads forum.   Best of luck to ya!; > I was trying to understand the correlation between VFIAX and VOO a bit better. Seems VFIAX has some sort of small fee associated with it as well as a minimum investment amount?

One is mutual fund, one is an ETF. You'll have to do your own reading on the differences there.

Funds have ""expense ratios"" which is the relative cost, to the shareholder, of managing the fund. Index-based funds tend to be low. VOO is 0.03%, VFIAX is 0.04%. By comparison, there are funds out there with expense ratios well above 1.00%. 

So in this case, I'd consider the difference to be negligable. 

> In terms of TSM it was a company that I see come up a lot when listening to some financial podcasts. I’m not necessarily well versed in the semi conductor world.

There's a saying out there, ""invest in what you know."" Whether that's the industry you work in, or if it's a product or company you're familiar with in everyday life, etc. And if nothing else, to do the homework on a company's financials before investing in it.

To put your money into some individual company, in a sector you're not all that familiar with, without having done the fundamental financial research, because it comes up on podcasts... 😬 that just is too much of a gamble to me. But you do you.; If you want to be overweight in Tech, then you may want to just buy QQQM instead of individual stocks.

Maybe think about an allocation like:

75% VOO
20% QQQM
5% TSM; Yeah that's one of the primary purposes of portfolio balance.

If you set a target of 50% Asset1 and 50% Asset2, if Asset1 dips (or Asset2 grows) more than the other, Asset1 will now be less than 50% of your portfolio - so when you rebalance you will either put all of your new money into Asset1 or maybe even sell-to-buy Asset2 (considering tax costs) to get it back to 50/50.

That gives you the effect I described earlier, but operating off a target % removes emotions and whims from the equation (and it can be automated if preferred).; Fidelity and vanguard are the lowest fees in the game. Them not having a connection to the money is the key brother. Connection to the money is your weakness. That is what concerns me about your comments. For people just getting started, I normally just tell them VOO on a weekly basis, set it and forget it. But when the money is large, that is when pro management is worth it. I think of it like a car: if you had a 200k car, would you pop the hood and start tinkering with the engine? Still do stuff on your own, for sure. Fidelity is great platform for that. But for that amount of money I’m scared for you. You will get buyers remorse and make common rookie mistakes. A pro will remind you to remove emotion. Zoom out. Stick to the plan. The problem with Fidelity and vanguard is that the advisors aren’t paid well, so they just happy with what you give them, they don’t push you to do more (which I personally believe is an advisor’s TRUE job). Good luck my man!; I appreciate the honest feedback! It’s why I posted here because I know that I’m not as well versed in investing as I’d like to be. Thanks again.; Thank you!; Thank you sir! I appreciate all your feedback and know removing my emotions will be the key here."
Vanguard Funds: VTSAX and VHYAX,"VTSAX is admiral shares of VTI. Total Market.

But I also hold VHYAX. A fund that is supposed to provide dividend efficiency.

For the new year I am thinking of consolidating everything into VISAX.

Dividends are kind of pointless for the little amount of capital you have allocated.  You'd be better off consolidating some of those into SPYD (S&P etf that pays a higher dividend) if you are really committed to dividends. (Apple, Google are in the SPY ETF--all the Mag7's are in SPY and QQQ) 

Again, assuming you are young, I think you should be more allocated to growth. You'll make more with growth stocks than divvy stocks.

Analysis of XPEL,"**The Business:**

XPEL sells, distributes, and installs protective paint film (PPF) along with other protective coatings and care products aftermarket in the automotive, marine, and architectural window markets.  Founded in 1997, listed on the NASDAQ since 2019, XPEL began as a software company designing vehicle patterns used to produce cut-to-fit protective film for the painted surfaces of automobiles. In 2007, they expanded in selling automotive surface and paint protection film products to complement their proprietary software.  They currently boast the best self-repairing PPF on the market with their ULTIMATE product line and operates in 12 countries globally.  

In their 2023 Annual Report, revenues were generated in the following segments:

* Surface and Paint Protection film sales represented approximately 58.0% of consolidated revenue
* Installation, Dealership and OEM Services were roughly 18%
* Automotive Window film made up 14.8%
* Architectural window film sales represented approximately 2.3%
*  SaaS subscription accounted for >2%.
* The remaining revenues came from ceramic coatings, aftercare products, and other misc. items.

Automotive products make up the vast bulk of their revenue with PPF wraps being the major revenue generator.  To that end, XPEL has a certified installer program that is coupled with their Design Access Platform (“DAP”), which is a SAAS platform and database consisting of over 80,000 vehicle applications.  The benefits of using software for installation include increased installation efficiency and reduction of waste.  They primarily operate by selling directly to independent installers and new car dealerships, which includes XPEL protection films, installation training, access to the DAP software, marketing support and lead generation. Approximately 63.2% of consolidated revenue was through this channel in 2023.  Sales are global, with North American representing 67.7% of total sales and China representing 10.5%.

**The Industry:**

I'm focusing on the the global automotive wrap films market because of the bulk of XPEL's revenue coming from this segment.   The size of this market was valued at USD 6.21 Billion in 2022,  Estimates range from 11% up to 22% out to 2032, which includes both the selling of and installation of PPFs.  Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) is the most popular material, which accounted for 82.74% of the market in 2023.  Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is another common material used in PPF.  TPU boasts self-healing properties, which helps explain its dominance in the market.

**XPEL by the Numbers:**

* 23.6% CAGR on Revenue from 2021 to 2023.
   * 2021 revenue growth was 63% over 2020, which skews the numbers a bit, but since 2019 revenue growth has been 18% or greater.
* EPS grew from $0.51 to $1.91 from 2019 to 2023, with the lowest YoY growth being 27%.
* Gross Margin percent has climbed into the low 40% range and has been increasing each year since 2019.
* Unlevered Free Cash Flow has climbed from $4.98m to $18.37m, 2019 to 2023.
* Long term debt, as of Q3 2024, sits under $1m.  They have a Current Ratio of 4.35.
* Fiscal Year 2023 ended with ROE of 34.66%, ROA at 18.80%, and ROIC of 21.87%.
   * Company boasts double digits in all three ratios since 2019.
* SG&A has grown significantly, up 4x from 2019 to Q3 2024 TTM.
   * Growth in marketing strategy is management's explanation for the increase.
   * They expect Q4 to be flat QoQ. 

**Competitive Advantages:** 

* Brand Name - Xpel has a very strong brand name in the North American PPF market.  They protect their brand name through their certified installer program.  Their ULTIMATE line is recognized as one of the top 2 products lines on the market; STEK being recognized as the other.  XPEL's 10 year warranty shows they stand behind their product and adds another strength to the brand. 
* Switching Moat (weak) - their DAP software is comprehensive.  It ties in with the certified installer program.  Installers complete the program, use the software, and buy the product.  While not like switching from an Apple, Microsoft, or Enterprise software environment, it still represents some protection.
* Patents, Trademarks, and Copyrights - while manufacturing is done third party, XPEL holds patents on their products.  With the best self repairing wrap on the market, they have some pricing power on a premium product.  

**The Risks**

* XPEL competes with big names, such as 3M, Eastman Chemical Company, Saint-Gobain, STEK, SunTek, LLumar, and others.  XPEL is not a direct manufacturer of their products and rely on 3rd Part Manufacturers.  They could lose their competitive advantage if someone brings a better product to market.  
* Their business in China is localized through one distributor.  Alteration to or loss of that relationship would seriously impact their revenue and bottom line.  
* If the incoming Administration starts a trade war with China, it could seriously impair XPEL's business.  Both from a sales standpoint and raw material costs.  
* Failure to stand by their products or an excess of warranty claims could damage their brand, top line revenue, or costs that would impact the bottom line.
* A decline in the automotive industry as a whole would materially impact XPEL in their aftermarket industry.

**The Thesis:**

XPEL is a leader in their market and will continue to be.  They are well positioned to take advantage of industry growth with their low asset model, nearly no long-term debt, and brand awareness to grow market share through acquisition and organic growth. 

**Valuation:**

This company is still young and in a growth phase, so I feel a DCF Model is not the best way to go.\^1  Instead I'm using a Discounted Future Earnings model.  Earnings growth over the last 5 years has grown at a CAGR of 30%.  I'm using 20% over the next 5 years to be more conservative.  I used a discounted rate of 12.7% which is a WACC value pulled online.  Ending PE Ratio of 25.  Fair market value would be **$59.00/share**.  Using a 30% MoS because I'm still researching gives us a Buy Price of **$41.30**.

Based on my current analysis, I have opened a small, starter position in the company.


&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
^(1 - a simple DCF using TTM Free Cash Flow with a 20% growth rate that is halved at 5 years then halved again for a terminal rate at 10 years, with a 30% MoS, yields a buy price of $16.41.)  
^(§ - reposting my thoughts from another sub)",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hq5im5/analysis_of_xpel/,17,2024-12-31 04:22:18,"$XPEL is highly cyclical and there’s ALOT of competitors in the space.

They have been able to grow because they basically buy out distributors/outlets and place thier products within that channel.

I haven’t kept up with how their car dealer business is doing..

I made some money with them in the boom boom years but imo, due to the high competition, low player entrance cost, and current saturation of their products to-date… there’s better plays out there 🤷 imo; I appreciate your feedback.  I do believe they've built some competitive advantages into their model through their complete turn-key solution by offering certified training, their proprietary DAP software, and complementary product lines.  
  
They still distribute to independent dealerships.  They also have cooperative arrangements with Rivian and Tesla, though the Tesla business should/will decline due to Tesla introducing some PPF options at a couple of their facilities.  
  
Their global expansion and growth leads me to believe the market isn't saturated.  There's runway there still.  It's going to be tied closely to the new car market, so a sharp decline there will cause short-term pain.  However, as long as new cars are being sold, high-end cars especially, they'll have a market for their product.  
  
I'll grant you, this isn't a grand slam, 100 bagger.  But, I'll take base hits in the current market.  😆"
"Robinhood rugpulled me, what do I do?","
On december 20th I deposited around $5k into RH in order to buy some crypto. I bought said crypto and tried to withdraw a small amount, and then the rest of the crypto into a hardware wallet. The small transaction (<$1) went through, but when I tried doing the larger one it said that my account is restricted from withdrawing crypto. This was like my second time ever buying crypto on robinhood, I only did it on RH because my main exchange wasn’t working. 

The next day, I tried withdrawing again, to no avail. I tried liquidating the position and withdrawing cash, also no luck. At this point I had no response from live chat at all (up to now have still not received ANY non bot response). I get a request through the app to upload documents (id, bank statement, and selfie), which I do promptly. FYI I have passed kyc on robinhood already. 

Now, every single nth day of december I log on, I check the status of my verification and see the message “We’ll review your documents and notify you about your account restrictions by December n+1”. Basically, every time I log on, I am assured that I will get some update the next day. But when the next day comes, I’m assured an update the day after that. 

What do I do in this case? I have tried communicating with RH through any way I could find but have not received any response. No responses from live chat, email, or phone. Already filed SEC complaint. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hppyje/robinhood_rugpulled_me_what_do_i_do/,0,2024-12-30 16:44:04,"This is some red flag behavior. You deposited money, then immediately converted it to crypto and then tried to transfer that to another account? This 100% looks like a scam where you're trying to get the money out via crypto before the deposit fully clears and is possibly rejected or someone else claims the money was fraudulently taken from their account.; You're trying to trade with uncollected funds.  Then you're trying to pull crypto on uncollected funds.  It's only been 4 bank settlement days since you made the deposit.

Of course you got restricted.; This post is so confusing.


Did your deposited funds clear (become available funds to trade) when you bought the crypto?

What is the status of the deposited funds now?

What is your current position?

 That is do you own crypto now? Or have you sold it and made a profit or loss? 

Do you have cash in your account ready to make trades? 

Do you have deposited cash that doesn't show?

The normal process is

You deposit money-money clears-you buy crypto-you either withdraw the crypto to a wallet or you sell it - cash available in account changes reflects precious steps

Where has robinhood exactly failed?; I think you need to contact them. I guess this sucks but in the future use a legit broker.; If you aren't money laundering then this looks like money laundering activity.

You did a deposit.  
bought crypto.  
sold crypto.  
Tried to withdraw/transfer the money before the original deposit even fully cleared. To a DIFFERENT account then where the deposit came from!?

Of course you got restricted and triggered every anti money laundering system on the way.

I would never put my money on that platform;

no issues so far

Why?

> and then the rest of the crypto into a hardware wallet. 

Why?

> The small transaction (<$1) went through, but when I tried doing the larger one it said that my account is restricted from withdrawing crypto. 

Probably because they saw you try to withdraw money you had *just* invested in crypto, which screams money laundering. Are you aware the PATRIOT Act requires brokerages to monitor for money laundering and other similar suspicious behavior?

> The next day, I tried withdrawing again, to no avail. I tried liquidating the position and withdrawing cash, also no luck. 

Of course not, they flagged your account for suspicious behavior 

> What do I do in this case? 

1. Wait. Your account has been flagged for fraud/money laundering. It’s going to take some time for their investigation to be completed. Normal CSRs probably can’t even see into your account since the fraud department should have shut access to your account down (if RH knows what they’re doing as a brokerage)
2. In the future, avoid behaviors that look like money laundering to their fraud department.
3. Probably avoid Robinhood; Agreed, you fucked yourself OP.  Any self-respecting (aka not “rug pulling”) institution would protect their (and by extension, your) assets here.  

You, in the hypothetical situation of being a person who possibly didn’t know about the bank deposit and subsequent crypto withdrawal to a random address making it effectively “cash”.  albeit a terrible form of cash that is very volatile and can be sketchily traded for actual cash.

They’re trying to protect everyone involved, you, your bank account.  Just not your gambling interests.; My account is basically in limbo. I’m restricted from buying anything with what’s sitting in my account. It’s just cash. They are not letting me withdraw anything and not telling me why.; This is a good point. Been hearing a lot about the difference in business models between traditional brokerages and RH. It's crazy how much these new brokerage apps mimic gaming/casinos.; > I think you need to contact them. I guess this sucks but in the future use a legit broker.  

It's very common now for all crypto exchanges to have hold times for any deposits, often up to a full week. You can thank all the dummies who did chargebacks or told their banks that someone else deposited the cash to the exchange so that they could withdraw free crypto.; Contacting them has proven to be impossible; Just be forewarned that the outcome might be the same. The first time I made a large deposit to Fidelity they held it for 15 business days. I could invest it but not withdraw it. If they told me I didn’t notice, I just happened to find it mentioned on an out-of-the-way tab: “$10,000 of this balance isn’t available until January.”; What do you mean by legit brokers? Do you have any examples (especially ones that are also available in Europe?); There are much better ways to purchase than fuckin robinhood. Crypto is fine just don’t be dumb; Yeah that's the lesson here. 


Don't let your hate blind you. ; You mean don't money launder; Almost every brokerage didn’t allow you to buy GME during that time. Which ones did?; [deleted]; I understand that firms have risk management and compliance rules that they have to follow, which warrants them putting holds on accounts. That’s fine and I get that. They are rugpulling me because they are making the hold indefinite and not taking any steps to look into it. They are ignoring all of my communication requests.; You probably triggered AML controls. You simply have to try to contact your broker. 

Also - complaining to the SEC is probably not going to help since you said it was crypto. Crypto transactions are not regulated by the SEC.; Yeah. I guess I'm not clear. No one will let you withdrawal cash or equivalent until the deposit has cleared.; I don't know anything about Europe. For usa use fidelity, Schwab or vanguard are big ones; I disagree, crypto is not investing. It’s pure speculation; Nope - that's not really true. I traded GME just fine at several brokers. The reason why RH shut down buying of meme stocks was because RH didn't have the same maturity and sophistication to handle the net cap risks as other brokers.

RH generally caters to less sophisticated and inexperienced investors and wanna-be traders so I think a lot of people simply misunderstand what happened at RH during the GME event.; Correct. Etrade screwed me on some gains because they shut down buying and selling during various stages when it was going down.; I didn’t say it was money laundering, I said it can appear to their fraud department as though it’s money laundering. This clearly tripped AML flags at RH; Robinhood the $34 billion dollar corporation isn't engaging in a half dozen felonies to steal your $5,000.

It will get sorted out eventually.; They are legally not allowed to talk to you about a suspicious activity investigation until it’s complete.  This is standard procedure at any financial institution.; The thing is, there is no way for me to get into contact with them. They ignore all avenues of communication I try. Phone call, email, live chat all don’t work.; I never said it was investing. Just better ways to buy. I know lots of people making crazy money with crypto. They are all very smart though. You can play the trends; Please name the brokers. TD Ameritrade didn’t work 

Please name the brokers; [deleted]; That's kinda why most people don't recommend using RH. Their support is generally considered sub-par and inferior to other brokers. Try sending a written letter. And continue to call them.

What you described does sound like an AML restriction. It probably just takes a while to get through whatever AML reviews are required.; I traded on Merrill Edge, Fidelity, Schwab, and TDA. This was in both IRA's and margin accounts. I carry PM at Fidelity and TDA. And I was trading option short strangles at the time.  Obvious in the IRA's I traded different strategies other than strangles and naked calls.

Not sure why it wouldn't have worked for your at TDA. Maybe you didn't have the BP,

All the brokers that I used raised margin requirements to 100% but I had sufficient BP and cash to trade.; OP literally tried to do all 3 steps of the money laundering process within 2 days right around a global holiday. Just because it's a small amount doesn't mean it won't trip the AML algorithms. 


Now he just has to give it time for a shitty broker to sort it all out.; Basically every US-centric exchange requires photo ID for selling crypto but not buying. OP's photo ID is stuck in limbo because of RH dragging its feet. It's not a rugpull, just a combination of cheat customer service (probably not helped by the holiday season) and standard regulations.; Thanks. For me TDA was down for several hours; I only use ToS and I login usually before market open. Could have been capacity related. I know that Schwab recently had some capacity authentication issues after the final TDA account migration earlier this year."
What is the level and valuation when it becomes impossible for Apple's share price to grow?,"In the past decade Apple's share price has gone up 900%, and it now sits at a valuation of $3.8 trillion, already worth more than the GDP of all countries. If the same growth rate occurs for the next decade, Apple will be worth $34 trillion, or the US economy plus $10 trillion. How can Apple keep growing over the nest few years and decades? Surely it some point the law of large numbers will trip it up?",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hpp74o/what_is_the_level_and_valuation_when_it_becomes/,106,2024-12-30 16:08:58,"Why would you compare GDP to market cap?

GDP would be comparable to revenue or something recurring; It simply won't (can't) grow as much as it did in the last decade, but GDP isn't a limitation to a company's valuation; It can grow infinitely, but that doesn’t mean it will.

The GDP comparison never makes sense and the growth of Apple has already been slowing down. It won’t keep the same growth rates of the past.

That being said as long as Apple sells more devices as they did before or find new services or products to sell they will grow.; It will always grow due to inflation. And whatever new products they come out with; The Mag7 will eventually become the government. There’ll only be pseudo elections, if at all, in the future. The big giants will continue to grow beyond $30T, $50T, $100T with inflation.; It’s basically a bank at this point. I’d trust Tim with my money more than Bank of America.; I remember earlier in the decade when apple had a $300 billion market cap and a lot of comments were calling apple overvalued.

It's 10x since then; Because it is not gonna go up 900% again over the next decade. It can continue to outperform, but 900% Is completely unrealistic.; I’ll give you the real answer: 
Majority of people working finance claim they know how to properly value a stock. But the actual good investors will never make such a ridiculous claim. 

It’s worth what others are willing to pay. That’s it

* and the reasons are many. R&D expenditures, crowd cultures, hype etc.; One of the interesting aspects of stock investing is that market leaders usually change.  The largest company by market cap were different in 2010, 2000, 1990 and 1980 than today  At some point apple will also not be the largest company by market cap. 

1980:

Can Apple outperform? Yes there are markets they can grow sales in but it’s going to be harder and slower. 

Do I personally think Apple is going to continue to outperform? No. I think its valuation has disconnected from its actual earnings and projections. I believe their stock buyback is so large and their decision to stop reporting unit sales for many products paint a picture of the company seeing slowing growth. 

Do I think Apple is safe stock to buy? Yes. It’s a cash cow that’s created a borderline self sustaining customer base for its products. On top of that they buy back a disgusting amount of stock and will continually get more inflows from passive funds.; To learn about how companies are valued in the market (or theoretically should be), you can read ""The Intelligent Investor"" by Benjamin Graham.  It goes through the details about how to read balance sheets and understand the financial drivers of the stock price.  That said, the valuation of the M7 stocks is historically relatively high in terms of P/E and the book was written long before any of these tech companies existed.  However, it is a good starting point.; AAPL can continue to go up just due to inflation and stock buybacks, although I would be concerned about current valuation; They can grow forever. Inflation rises 2-3% per year which will continually boost revenue, earnings, and share price. They’ll continue to use their FCF to buy back shares which will boost EPS and share price. And developing countries will continue to expand and buy their products. India alone has 700M people buying cell phones, but only 12M of them are iPhones. There’s no reason Apple couldn’t sell 100M+ to them. Same in China. Same in Brazil. Same in a lot of countries.; Third worlder here. iPhones used to be largely unaffordable for the masses. Now with 24 to 48 month installment plans coupled with bnpl and trade-in schemes, even minimum wage earners and broke college kids in the third world can and do splurge on the latest Pro Max, Watches, MacBook every two to three years. 

And before you know it, there'll be a new Apple product for the masses. Never bet against Apple.; 

 > In the past decade Apple's share price has gone up 900%, and it now sits at a valuation of $3.8 trillion, already worth more than the GDP of all countries.

You, and many others, must get acquainted with the difference between a stock quantity (the market valuation of a company"") and a flow quantity (the GDP of a country). The GDP of a country, which is a flow quantity, is the annual output of a system (the economy). The market valuation of a company, which  is a stock quantity (stock not intended as share), is a value at one point in time, it's not a periodic outcome, and it only varies due to variation in two other variables, price and number of shares. You're not comparing apples with apples.; [https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/price-sales](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/price-sales)

While it was growing sales 4 to 10 years ago, the P/S was in the 2 to 4 range. Now that it is no longer growing sales, the multiple has expanded to 10. Flat sales for 3 or 4 years now. They have reached a point where they can't ask people to pay more for iPhones, and you can only nickel and dime customers with service fees so much. IOW, it is expensive now.; Investors will eventually see what you saw. That the entire globe will need to dump everything they've ever made over a lifetime, in order to get the stock to go up just by 1%. 



Eventually people are going to get over the brand name of owning the stock. 


It's more important to me personally to have a high ROI percent. I'm not willing to sit here and hold Apple for a measly 3% gain a week. When I can dump it into quantums and get 40% gains a week


Eventually there will be a critical mass of investors who are tired of watching their Apple holdings collect dust, never growing more than a single percent because of how large the company is. 



I cannot tell you when that's going to happen, But I personally have written off Apple. Because I can make 10 times higher ROI on smaller companies that have a lot of room to grow. 



The time to buy Apple was 10 years ago. It is a boomer stock.; [deleted]; That market cap is so prodigious. I have shipped my apple, I just don't like it as much as Amazon. Amazon just feels so much more innovative and seems like it has room. Same for goog...; There is no top to dollar-denominated assets because there is no top to the amount of money printing by government; You are just looking at one number. You are not looking at the reason, the justification for that number.; It's not even the stock price valuation but with Apple the entire company valuation.; Three things have contributed to AAPL’s share price rising over the last decade:

* Earnings doubled
* PE quadrupled
* AAPL deployed hundreds of billions to buyback shares at relatively cheap prices

Of those three, I only think the first could happen again over the next decade. I dont think it’s reasonable to assume that the PE will 4x to 160. If anything, it’s safe to assume it will fall over the next 10 years.

And while they may deploy hundreds of billions in buy backs over the next 10 years, there will be two key differences. One, the prices probably wont be as deflated as they were. And two, hundreds of billions is less significant at its current valuation than when it was a sub-trillion dollar company (for example). Those two things mean that future buybacks should have less of an effect than previous attempts.

Tl;dr Yes it can grow, but dont expect a repeat.; *most countries. US, China, Japan and Germany have a GDP in excess of AAPL's cap. Though that's an irrelevant comparison.; I can tell Apple you will eventually pull out of the Asian largest market. Overpriced product for countries that make similar but sell for less.  It is cheaper to buy new Apple products in China than USA. If Apple has another local contender at home it will then reduce price of its products.; I don’t think there’s is a limit on how high numbers go; They will continue to grow but not as fast as we have seen in the past. Compared to Google and Tesla I feel like they are behind in AI. I feel like Robotics and AI assistants are going to be huge in the next 10 years. But this could change at any point because again apple likes to try an innovate and I could see them doing more to get involved. This is only based on my knowledge so correct me if I'm wrong.; Growing profits for a company like Apple is easier than growing revenue. They are insourcing chips and reducing third-party suppliers, which lowers their costs and improves their profits. So yes if they become more profitable their valuation will also increase; It’ll keep growing until everyone in the world owns it; I'll be the contrarian. This has seen it's high for the next couple years.; I sorta theorise that unless they up their game with better/cheaper products they will begin to lose market share. I just recently bought a cheap $350AUD Motorola, probably could have got it for 300 during all these recent sales. Point is though the Motorola is extremely fast and has almost all the new features most phones do with facial unlock to input passwords etc.. 8gb ram, snapdragon chip, 128gb storage forget the camera specs but it's quite good. Yeah brand name apple still has people by the throat for some reason but with everything becoming expensive is it really worth it to spend 4-5x that for a new iPhone with a couple extra features lol. iPhones at first were quite innovative no doubt, they sort of just held onto that original claim to fame and kept people with their brand but they are not really innovating anymore. Eventually if you do not innovate you will be left behind but apples so big I do not see it failing anytime in the remotely near future.; Why do people on Reddit not understand the difference between GDP and valuation or net worth?; Not a direct answer but if you’re worried about lower % ROI cuz apple too big then options is the solution. Options prices are cheaper when the stock is expected to move less so you can still get 50% yoy returns if apple only goes up a little bit per year; About three fiddy; That depends.  As long as they continue to have the money for MASSIVE buybacks, AAPL share price will continue to increase.  Outstanding shares peaked at 25B 10-12 years ago.  Today the float is 15B.  Not complicated.  Add to this all the money automatically flowing into index funds.  For every dollar, 7 cents goes to buying more AAPL.  There is a tremendous amount of tailwind for AAPL share price.; AAPL is overvalued right now if that’s what your asking; It can grow forever; Well not all companies can keep 10xing. 

What would realistically happen, is if they quit coming out with new ways to make more and more money, they would now start paying down debts, trying to cut costs over time, and keep supplying a good product. And turn into a dividend stock.; Um not when people are crazy enough to buy their products every year to have the newest edition iPhone or tablet.  How do you expect it to just level out?  People will just magically become satisfied and not want to compete?  As long as there is a demand, Apple will fulfill it.; I don't know and at this point I don't care, their product launches have failed miserably and the last 150% gains in the stock have been purely empty hype for ai and multiple expansion, who is to say the same idiots don't slap a 50 or 60 pe on it next, I'm just staying away from apple; If they come out with like an apple toilet or apple shoe. Infinity and beyond.; Never?; As many of you are saying, it is not that Apple cannot grow but its growth currently relative to its earnings and sales is way way overpriced and overvalued relative to its historical norms and price.
It is very richly priced in the Mag7 and I would go as far as saying it is the most overpriced in the 7/8 relative to its projected growth.  

Yes it has and will always have innovation but I hold to the thesis we are overbought on this company currently.

It is a hard sell until the earnings “catch up” and sales to justify a reasonable even if stretched a little valuation.; Apple marketcap is 3.812 billion USD vs 123 billion USD profit in the last 12 months.

Tesla's marketcap is 1.356 billion USD vs 8.73 billion USD profit in the last 12 months.

You could find similar numbers for NVDA, MSFT or Google.
All of them are valued 1 or 2 or 3 billion USD and make between 1% and 3% profit of their marketcap every year.
These companies could still grow in marketcap if they solidy a monopoly, kill competitors and stay innovative.

If people are still using iPhone 26 and AirPods 9 in a decade or 2 or whatever replaces the iPhone, they could grow.

If not, well idk; Hard to match the explosive growth over the last 15 years because they rolled out smartphones and app store...which took the world by storm. If the rest of the developing world can gain access to their products or services we can still see very high growth. ""The next billion users"" still don't have resources for flagship phones...but older ones that Americans don't want anymore can still turn profit in marginalized countries. Plus 30% app store revenue will continue to grow as the user base does.

The brand overall has failed to ""wow"" users since Jobs died. Tablets/watches/goggles...all meh. Their ai and the concept/execution of a personal ai assistant/companion may be a bigger driver than their hardware itself in the next decade.; You have to understand that Apple and most of the other big stocks that are overvalued are trading on sentiment. 

They are not trading on value, fundamentals, future earnings. So don't look at them that way. That's not the current trade.

They'll continue like this until investing money runs out, or until the economy tanks or when there is a wake up call like bad earnings where people realize they've paid for a stock with a forward P/E of 42 and that's dumb.

Look, I don't care if you want to blow the ghost of Steve Jobs because you love Apple so much and believe in the company's future blah blah blah - paying a $42 premium for $1 of **expected** future earnings is some dumb shit. 

Until one of the above happens, the price can go to the moon. 

Most of the entire stock market has completely diverged when it comes to price vs. value.

It will have to normalize and if you think it will notmalize by earnings coming up to meet price then you could be right. You'll just have to wait a decade holding a stock you paid too much for.

The more plausible scenario is price drops.

It's the same with commercial real estate, housing, Bitcoin, gold.

Almost all asset classes are overvalued because they sucked up all the money in the economy.; With all the share buybacks Apple does, I believe the share price could grow at a rate that outpaces the market cap growth.; and why would you compare american GDP to an global behemoth like apple?; [deleted]; I hear this argument a lot. But if you want to buy a country I guess you would look at the revenue aka gdp; Yes exactly it can't and won't grow like in the last decade yet it is valued 2.5 times higher than a decade ago, and people still think it is a good investment right here I can't even with some people; That’s not it, as long as ETFs continue to grow they will pour in money into the biggest company in the market l, there’s no fundamental reason to justify the valuation, they barely grow and are up 34% YTD. It’s all about flows now; Or the same number of devices but at a higher price point.

Or the same number and price point but with higher margins  

> growth of Apple has already been slowing down 

Up 34% YTD 🤷 ; And the fact that the world economy grows too, at at least 1% a year ; >And whatever new products they come out with

""with titanium""; This.  Asset prices will continue to grow so long as the current system is in place and more and more currency is issued.  

Money gets paid out to the lowest tier who spend it on goods and services so that it all eventually collects in the hands of the wealthiest 10%.  This class of people have very little need for more money so just keep buying assets to hedge against inflation and try to at least keep pace with it.; Not how it works; ""It will always grow"" This is literally impossible. At some point, Apple will stop growing.; Good one.; Weyland-Yutani has entered the chat.; We saw a pseudo president in office for the last 4 years; I still can't wrap my head around trillion $ valuations. For a long time when I was growing up, Aramco was the only company that had a valuation that high but even then you could kind of scoff at it since they were basically an extension of a large government. Then Apply hit $1 trillion...since then it seems like $1 trillion is the new $100 billion, even though $1 trillion is much, much, much larger than going from, say, $1 billion to $100 billion.; This. There's a thing called the law of large numbers, which is why mega cap stocks can't grow as fast as small and mid cap stocks. Almost none of the stocks that went up 1,000% or more over the last decade were already large cap stocks, I believe the only one that was is UHC.; If you had to estimate, what would you say its rough growth rate % per year for the next decade will be?; Buffett and Munger would disagree with you. Companies have intrinsic values, because the market is auction driven it will mean the market is not always correct.; Some days I wish they had stuck with that.; Yes I agree it is a flawed comparison, as market cap also takes into account future value creation. 


I was mainly using it as symbolic of how vast (and arguably vastly inflated) Apple's valuation is ; Imagine a world where apples are made by Apple.; It's vertical integration and yeah, Apple can optimize a lot of their supply chain to increase net profits will still maintaining the same revenue. 

Another thing to note is that if Apple increases the price of the iphones by just $50, they would make an easy additional  10 billion + profit per year.; Everything made by Apple ? You have to be joking; Honestly outside of inflation being a significant part of a doubling in earnings I think even that isn't that likely over the next decade. Apple's earnings have barely moved for a couple of years now, and what new market can they realistically get into that will be as transformative as the original iPhone was? The Vision Pro was a massive flop despite all the hype. And the government's anti-trust actions against Google could cause the $20+ billion that Apple rakes in via Google paying to be the default search engine each year to disappear, not to mention other anti-trust action could potentially hurt Apple's earnings in other areas to over the next 10 years. The only realistic avenue I see for Apple to keep growing their earnings is via service revenue (a high margin business that has been steadily growing).; That doesn’t make sense lol do you know what those words mean; Actually, they said the “GDP of all countries.”; Lol is your reply really bc ChatGPT said so?; US GDP is like $30Tn. If you consider this as the revenue and stick a c. 1.5x revenue multiple on that (more or less average EV/Revenue of the S&P of 3x with a 50% discount for lower growth of c2-3% vs 5-6% average *revenue* growth rate for S&P companies), the US would be valued at $45Tn.; The U.S. isn’t for sale so it invalidates market cap; > Yes exactly it can't and won't grow like in the last decade

Someone like you would have said the same thing 10 years ago but the truth is you have no idea what AAPL will do over the next decade. I think they’re getting more into the medical software and hardware space which would be a big new revenue stream for them.

You don’t know what’s going to happen with quantum computing either. After all these telecom hacks in the US, iMessages to iMessages were the only texts that weren’t exposed. Apple will continue to focus on creating secure hardware and software and I think they will continue to be successful; ETFs have been around for a fair a bit of time now still Nvidia was able run up the ranks to almost the top. While ETF do contribute a fair bit of money they are not the only ones and they do not do dictate the direction; A company like apple produces a massive amount of cash which they use to aggressively buy back shares. They bought back almost half of their shares in the past decade which means even at 0 net income growth the EPS doubles.; > Up 34% YTD 🤷 

He's talking about its financials, not its stock price...; Yes, but you don't have to buy AAPL to benefit from that growth. Just buy something like (UL) Unilever at a much cheaper valuation. It has plenty of exposure to emerging markets like India, is recession-resistant, and doesn't need to keep coming up with new ""innovations"" like Apple Intelligence and Vision Pro.; And that more and more people in underdeveloped countries will have more expendable income.

Hell, Apple could make a ""cheapo"" phone for those markets right now to offset Android's market share, but they've been fine _so far_ keeping it a ""premium"" product.; I like Titanium. Too bad it’s a poor conductor of heat so Apple can’t use it in more places.; There is a difference between growing in value vs growing in USD. Because of inflation everything even with same value will be higher USD price endless, until inflation stops.; When equity matures it generally shifts towards profit sharing and dividend payouts over reinvestment for growth.


But this has fallen out of favor and Apple would undoubtedly seek new areas to expand into before reaching such a transformational point.; That’s the beauty of inflation and businesses. Eventually most companies will be trillion $ companies.; It’s impossible to say. I strongly believe in Apple, so I think it’s going continue to outperform the sp500. But it’s probably only going to outperform by 1-5% per year the next decade.; It used to trade at a PE ratio of 9-16 times earnings. Now it's at about 40. That's a trick for price growth that can't really repeat unless it gets serious earnings growth.


https://m.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/pe-ratio; Well, not exactly what I’m talking about. Butd finitely related. if you’re interested you should look up R&D expenditures in innovative companies. You’ll see a strong historic correlation, in what Buffett and many others considered pure expenses (R&D) 2 decades ago, with market value.  Especially so in innovative industries. It is still the most interesting and difficult subject when it comes to the valuation of a company. - Which is why anyone who claims they can do it properly - is vastly misinformed or straight up naive; [deleted]; AAPL is cyclical. Sales are largely flat until a super cycle hits. But yea, inflation will play a significant role in helping AAPL grow its earnings at 7% over the next 10 years; Market cap is share price times number of shares outstanding. If the number of shares drops, then the market cap could drop despite the other number (share price) rising. Which could easily happen if investors decide it deserves a lower P/E. 

100 shares at $10 a share = $1,000 market cap
80 shares at $12 a share = $960 market cap.; Yeah. It’s a joke.. loosen your anus.; Ah yeah. Was drinking when I plugged in the GDP number. Duh.; Dude the US is totally for sale. Already been bought actually. Elon is one of your masters.; Did you look up equity ETFs in 2008 vs now ?look at the explosive growth it’s growing by an average of 25% yearly. Not saying it’s only ETFs but for top companies ETF inflow helps a lot; Yeah because as investors we get paid based on the P&L, not the stock price 🤦‍♂️ ; You don't think millions of people in emerging Indian middle classes are going to buy Apple products?; Decades ago I remember when the talk was the growing global economy will launch emerging markets out of poverty and into the middle class. Since 1995 UL turned a $10,000 investment into $12,232. (Backtested).; At some point in the next century, or perhaps even the next decade, Apple’s market value will likely hit a peak it won’t surpass again. Selling phones and laptops can only take the company so far—it needs bold moves into new markets to sustain its dominance. Its foray into chip-making has been interesting, but it’s unclear how much further that can drive growth. Meanwhile, its efforts in AI and autonomous vehicles haven’t gained meaningful traction, and time may not be on its side.; The current share price implies it’s going to grow a lot faster than that; [deleted]; ... when your mind is uploaded to the Apple afterlife.; Your tears taste salty; Sounds a lot like the Nifty 50. It’ll sort itself out; You kind of do though? 

The stock price is based on the financials. If Apple's income isn't growing fast enough, then it's a lot harder to justify its current stock price at a valuation of over 40x earnings, which is pricing in a lot of growth. Likewise, it's harder to justify its stock price going up further.; They will, eventually. But they’ll also be spending money on fast food (DPZ, YUM) and consumer staples like toothpaste (CL), and these are more affordable than premium smartphones.; UL is up over 450% since 1995. Your numbers are wrong.; There's a big difference between it ""being literally Impossible"" and ""will likely hit a peak"".

Why exactly _can't_ it keep growing, in theory? What makes it impossible, considering it keeps growing relative to the economy and the economy keeps growing too.; Why are people upvoting you? So much ignorance about how stock prices work.; Can you give you’re calculation on that? And growing faster than what?; I am saying I believe it will outperform the SP500 by 1-5% per year.; You should just put your money in an index fund man; Thanks. Don’t know how or where, but I screwed up majorly.  However, 450% is not something I would have been happy about. Maybe the next decades will  be better.; I’m too lazy to create a DCF so got Chat GpT to calculate it for me. Based on current share price, ~8% WACC, and latest free cash flows they would need a terminal growth rate of just over 10% to justify their current price 

As a comparison Walmart’s FCF growth over the past decade has been 1.9%

I don’t think anyone sane expects the S&P to return 10% annually despite the recent run up 

It’s not an exact science but it’s fun to play around with these hypothetical since you don’t even need to boot up excel anymore to get rough estimates; Apples 5 yr EPS growth rate is expected to be roughly 12%.; That’s apples to oranges but once again I don’t think anyone expects the S&P to return 12% for the next 5 years so either way it’s far outpacing the index"
What do you think the main event is in terms of AI sector in 2025? Probably the software part prevails...,"Over the weekend, there was a lot of buzz surrounding the DeepSeek-V3 model, with reports claiming that it completed training using only a minimal number of GPUs. In fact, Chinese power concept stocks in the stock market saw a sharp drop last Friday due to this news, but AI-related stocks in the U.S. market remained unaffected.

Just think about it: ByteDance, the Chinese tech giant, is investing 80 billion RMB in computational power in 2024, with an estimated 160 billion RMB next year. It’s unlikely that they will reduce their investment just because of the changes in the training costs of this single model!

Moreover, after conducting some weekend research, it turns out that DeepSeek is a model that took shortcuts—it’s like walking through a maze with a map, skipping the trial-and-error process of exploring each path.

**Here’s a quick breakdown of the research results:**

DeepSeek V3 671B used 2048 H800 units for two months of training, while Llama 3.1 405B used 16,000 H100 units for 80 days. It’s important to note that not all of the 2048 H800 units were used for training power.

1. The computational power consumption of high-quality data generated by the DeepSeek R1 model (which is comparable to OpenAI's o1) is not included.
2. The computational power consumed during the model architecture exploration and debugging stage is not included.

**What does this mean?**

* Point 1: It’s like having a map while navigating a maze directly.
* Point 2: It’s like ignoring the time spent building the program before entering the maze.

This essentially represents a targeted and efficient training approach under objective conditions.

Exploring this method is very meaningful and can inspire many companies on how to better compress hardware requirements under limited computational power. In this regard, it will be very beneficial for future application development. For instance, consider two AI projects: Company A spends 1 million in costs, while Company B only spends 100,000. While the results generated by AI may not be perfect, in certain fields where the demands aren’t too high, it may be sufficient! Lower costs and meeting specific sector standards could open doors for many small and medium-sized AI companies, helping them overcome the barrier to entry and seize opportunities in AI development.

While it’s hard to admit, China has the most experience in this area—be it from Huawei’s mobile phones to ByteDance’s AI (Doubao). This could be a valuable lesson for small and medium-sized companies in the U.S. For example, China’s $AIFU, a small-cap stock combining AI and insurance, is rapidly growing by using AI to develop insurance broker apps. In the U.S., companies like Applovin, a mobile advertising and analytics platform, provide tools to help mobile app developers grow their user base and increase revenue.

**I’m still more inclined to believe that the biggest opportunities for small-cap AI companies will be in AI + software applications in 2025—such as Opendoor Technologies ($OPEN) for AI-powered second-hand homes, $AIFU for AI + insurance, and Carvana ($CVNA) for AI-powered used cars.**

Once hardware innovation stabilizes, development costs will drop rapidly, and the focus will then shift to software. Therefore, in 2025, the main opportunity for AI will definitely be in software!",https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1hpdqsr/what_do_you_think_the_main_event_is_in_terms_of/,13,2024-12-30 04:20:23,"All software products will have “AI” as a feature in 2025, and it’ll be useful but not gamechanging.

A oot if the truly impactful AI software applications will be in the startup space and I expect as large software businesses hone in on their strategy, they’ll buy their innovation and there will be a lot of M&A action over the next several years.  We’re still a bit away from IPO’s of AI led product companies; In 2025, AI will likely focus more on software applications, especially as hardware costs stabilize. The DeepSeek-V3 model's efficient training suggests AI companies can achieve great results with less computational power, lowering entry barriers for small and medium-sized firms. Industries like AI in insurance, real estate, and used cars (e.g., $AIFU, $OPEN, $CVNA) will benefit as software-driven solutions take center stage.; One stock to keep an eye on, or if you have funds to own some, is SNOW"
How to invest in broad market minus a few stocks?,"Most of my money's in index funds, but there are a few stocks that I don't believe are worth paying for.

I pretty much want an index fund like VOO minus a few stocks such as APPL, TSLA, MSTR (especially TSLA and MSTR). Idealy a financial institution would provide a bunch (500+) check boxes for each compaany (sorted by market cap) where by default it buys the same fraction of each stock.

Essentially I want to create a custom index fund where my custom fund has almost every notable company in the USA or the world. I like being lazy and do not want to buy 500+ stocks ever time I get a paycheck.

From googling around there are services that offer something called ""direct indexing"" but I don't see why buying / selling a market proportional ammount should cost 0.4% / year. I also do not understand why there would need to be ""rebalancing"" since ETFs such as VOO own (throwing out a number) 5% of everything and buy / sell as people buy / sell the ETF.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hodyic/how_to_invest_in_broad_market_minus_a_few_stocks/,3,2024-12-28 21:03:52,"It's actually pretty straight-forward and there are a few ways to do this.

1. Short the equal amount of shares of the ETF.
2. Use an SMA where the manager supports restrictions and add your restrictions
3. Use direct index products where you create your own index.

yes - you have to rebalance because market cap indices change when the value of the underlying changes. Also  - there may be index changes. If you want to follow an index - that index will reconstitute and rebalance. 

Not sure what you mean about the fee - these are not free services.

I assume you realize that adding restrictions to an index means that you are introducing a tracking error and changing the beta.; I like this idea of a “create your own adventure” (c) S&P500. Perhaps one of the platforms will make this a (nearly) free feature with all the competition and desire to differentiate themselves.

I’d probably try it to see if I could beat the S&P. But I wouldn’t want to pay extra because I probably can’t.; Here is an alternative to direct indexing, might work out cheaper:

Initial Investment Advice ,"Alright, I'm thinking about putting $200 away for some initial savings. I'm 19 so all the time to let It grow, but I want a good return on my investment.

I have 3 options:

1. Open a Share Term Account: Higher Interest, but slower growth at 4.4% APY



2. Invest In KO and hold It: Bacardi and Coke are doing a collab In '25, maybe when that drops shares should see some good return. I'd own about 3.3 Shares. 




3. Invest In SPY ETF: Really eyeing this one, think for longterm growth this Is my best option. 

For context I'm on disability, In Job Corps for Welding, I.e get an additional pay of $41 every other week (yes not the most, but everything else Is covered, and I mean everything. It's a sweet deal honestly). That means I get a sum of $407 a month, once I pay my phone and credit card. 

I'm thinking halfing that monthly to $200, most likely $150, In additional investments. Out of the 3 options, which would lead me to see some good growth? Any other ETF'S I should know of?",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hobj5f/initial_investment_advice/,7,2024-12-28 19:14:44,"Forget about option #2. Every other investor already has that info and it's priced in. 

SPY is your best bet, but instead buy something comparable with lower expense such as VOO.; Robinhood or Cashapp lets you buy $50/week automatically of VOO. Just set that up. As your income increases, increase your weekly amount to what you can. Do that all your life. You won’t have money issues. You will start to understand how it works. Just keep increasing your automatic. Never get rid of your automatic. You don’t have to buy whole shares, it will just buy what the $50 corresponds to.; Damn, what does priced In mean? Like everyone knows It's worth now or something?

I'll look Into VOO, as It stands SPY Is $595.01, which means $200 Is jack, unless .33 shares grow. Not like Vanguards significantly cheaper, but I'll look Into both. SPY was the plan; hard liquor sales are in the dump as well; Sweet, think that's the plan, another comment recommended I read up, so I'll get wise before doing anything. What does ""automatic"" refer to?; Yes basically. Anytime you read about news that could affect the price of a stock - 99% of the time, others learned this info way before you did, and already bought/sold accordingly. [Here's an article](https://lifetimefinancial.com/the-lifetime-blog/the-most-important-investing-concept-you-wont-find-explained-on-the-internet) on the concept.

And the price per share of SPY vs VOO is meaningless. Whether you own 1 share or 0.33 share, both would have gained the same percentage growth over the course of a year. Just like half a dollar is the same as 50 cents. The benefit of VOO is that you are charged less in fees. Focus on the $ value of your current holdings and not the # of shares owned. 

I recommend Fidelity as a brokerage so you can buy fractional shares of anything. That way the price per share is never a deterrent from buying what you want.; SCHX is basically VOO but Schwab does splits every now and then, so the share price is cheaper. I buy that instead of VOO because I can't do fractional shares in my brokerage. It's \~23 bucks now.; Automatic means you buy VOO on a recurring basis for a dollar amount. $100 every Friday for example. If it can’t buy a whole share it will buy a fractional of the share. This automates. This means you don’t have to log in every week to do it. Never rely on your own discipline. Automate. Increase that weekly if you can. Lower the weekly if you MUST. Always have a weekly. And soon you will see money is easy. Just that habit will force you to prioritize your future. If you notice little growth, you are likely putting in little effort. Compare your weekly to your bills. If your bills are way more than your weekly, then you are not living below your means. Your bills have more importance than your future. Good luck!; That's what I was hoping to hear, on share price of SPY, VOO, or any other ETF/MF. Will most likely Invest In both, but for now eyeing one. Either seems like a good choice honestly.

 Preciate' the article, totally let down the current price Is whats projected considering It's lower than the yearly peak of $73 bucks. You'd think an official collab would've boosted It more handsomely, but I digress.

Currently use Webull, all the same It allows fractional shares too right?; Looks like It's down, but the 6 month chart shows so good growth. Sounds good, but hope this trend of going down doesn't persist. Suppose that's the risk factor, could get about 8.6 shares with an initial $200 investment. 

What broker you use? I'm using Webull, may look Into Fidelity.; Thought so, just confirming. Exactly like auto-pay on bills. Lucky for me I only have one real bill, phone, my credit card Is a given. 

Def will be forgetting to log In, busy with trade school and junk. Better every week? Was thinking more monthly, or fractional weekly, whole on the first of each month.

Really appreciate this, what brokerage you use? I use Webull, but eyeing Fidelity. Does It really matter all the same If they both can do fractionals?; I gotta be honest. And I mean this in the nicest way, since we all had to start from scratch: You really should read a good book or two to get the fundamentals of investing. The fact that you want to buy both SPY and VOO tells me you really aren't sure how any of this stuff works. And that's ok!

Reddit is not the place to learn the basics. It's great for fine-tuning a plan, but you need a comprehensive step-by-step guide on what to do (and why it makes sense) to really internalize this stuff. The idea of a book may sound boring compared to just googling/redditing random questions, but I promise you the education is priceless (and actually much faster than trying to piecemeal it together with 500 google searches). A few that helped me get started:

Should be pretty darn close to VOO though. The holdings are about 99% the same.; Weekly is better in my experience. Monday or Friday. Doesn’t matter. The broker doesn’t matter either. Robinhood is easy to setup on the phone. Cashapp lets you do it too. Fidelity allows weekly auto with fractional buys. The main thing is to automate and have some mechanism to remind you to increase that weekly. The more you can do, the better. VOO or QQQM is fine. Auto, weekly, increase weekly when possible. Don’t rely on self discipline. Keep it simple. There is more to learn. But if you truly do a strong weekly, the answers work themselves out. Anything worth investing in has an option for auto weekly somewhere. Good luck!!; This Is the comment I was looking for, rather read some books on this. I have rough plan, but wasn't going to execute In both anyways without further knowledge. Will be saving this, see If the local library has these.

The New Normal in Asset Valuation,"With a “slight” delay, I finally watched *The Big Short*. Highly recommend it—excellent movie.

It got me thinking about how much the world has changed in the past 15 years. The 2007-2008 crisis was all about financiers selling bad products as good ones—until reality broke through the glitter, and the bubble burst. The protagonist of the film bet against the system as soon as he realized the product was fundamentally flawed. And he relatively easily waited for the explosion to occur. Truth prevailed quickly.

Now, things are completely different. We’ve been living in a well-known, yet unpopped bubble for years. Take Apple, for instance. It’s objectively a very good company. I like their products, I buy the new iPhone and AirPods, and I even own some of their shares. I’m by no means saying it’s a bad investment. But let’s examine it the way Burry and his colleagues looked at bonds—asking, “What’s really behind that AAA rating?”

It’s much easier for us now than it was for them. For our “investigation,” there’s no need to talk to exotic dancers or drive through dusty backwaters. Everything is right there in the public reports. The most basic figures, clear as day, show that today’s Apple is not a stock of future growth. It’s a classic cash cow: stable, profitable, but not growing. Adjusted for inflation, it’s actually a shrinking business. Net profit? $100 billion a year. Nearly all of it, with some extra, is distributed as dividends and buybacks. The company hasn’t released a genuinely successful new product in 10 years. Antitrust regulators aren’t fond of it. There’s no sign of explosive growth ahead, but the risk of a sharp decline exists.

What’s such a business objectively worth? Strictly less than a “risk-free” U.S. Treasury bond yielding $100 billion in coupons annually. How much less? You could write two volumes debating how to assess business risks. But it’s less—risk compared to no risk at the same yield. (Yes, U.S. Treasuries have risk too, but if “the dollar collapses,” the government would likely tax Apple into oblivion first.)

The 30-year bond we need costs $2.2 trillion today. Apple? $3.4 trillion. That’s an extra trillion right there. A trillion, Carl! The hole in 2007 was larger, but even then, a trillion would’ve been noticeable in the context of the entire crisis. And here I picked just one company, almost at random, and it’s a good company.

Everyone sees this; all the numbers are public. I haven’t discovered America here. Tons of independent analysts and experts predict a global crash based on similar logic—exactly like Burry once did. Many people believe them year after year, short the market, and lose money doing it. Meanwhile, the market keeps climbing, and whether it will actually collapse someday, nobody knows. For now, everything’s steadily growing; the pandemic records have long been surpassed. This isn’t 2007. Reality no longer breaks through the glitter.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ho8md2/the_new_normal_in_asset_valuation/,41,2024-12-28 17:02:12,"2008 was a credit crunch , like in simple terms banks borrow money at 4% and loan it out and get 4.1%

that 0.1% return is not much unless you leverage up, borrow a trillion dollars at 4% loan it out at 4.1% now that .1% of a trillion is a lot of money (overly simplified terms)

This is why a credit crunch is so bad, if your loans go bad well now you owe a lot of money , if your loans now only return 3.9% well now you are losing a lot of money 

The 2000 dot com bubble didn't affect the economy as bad as it wasn't a credit crunch , sure stock prices bubbled then popped but the underlying economy was still growing, there was not credit crunch

So even if there is an AI bubble and it burst and stocks go down 40% because investors realize AI is not going to pay off and revalue those companies , it might not cause a huge amount of real economic pain (unemployment , negative GDP growth); This seems like a flawed analysis. As I understand it, your argument is:

1. Apple pays out $100 billion in dividends and buybacks annually
2. You would need $2.2 trillion of US treasuries to collect $100 billion in interest annually 
3. Apple stock is riskier than US treasuries and also Apple has zero prospects for growth so Apple stock should be worth less than $2.2 trillion
4. Apple stock is worth $3.4 trillion
5. Therefore Apple is overvalued and the market is in a bubble 

I think the problem with your argument is #3 — it’s an extremely tenuous assumption.; If you liked the movie, read the book, Michael Lewis has a fantastic ability to explain complex ideas through interesting characters. The movie did a good job on the book though.; Not really sure where i read it, i'm lacking i'm that regard, but if you adjust the values of stock today by the M2 (money supply) the stock market is lower than in '00.; How much in TIPS is required to get $100B annually in coupon payments, which will adjust upward with inflation?

I’m guessing more than $3.4T…; > Strictly less than a “risk-free” U.S. Treasury bond yielding $100 billion in coupons annually. How much less?... The 30-year bond we need costs $2.2 trillion today. Apple? $3.4 trillion. 

You are forgetting that Apple (like almost all stocks) is an inflation-adjusted bond, using earnings yield. Prices for goods sold and bought both go up at approximately the rate of inflation so margin goes up with inflation.  That puts the yield at 2.276% (i.e. the TIPs yield).  Which gets you $3.623t using your math. 

BTW as someone who was investing back in 2005-8, lots of normal people knew the quality of housing bonds were really bad.  The argument was that:

1. Housing was a local market and there couldn't be a national decline in housing prices.  A diversified portfolio of mortgages was much safer than the underlying individual mortgages.  

2. A belief the underlying quality of the mortgages were better than what anecdotally people were seeing. 

Those scenes with the exotic dancer were about (2).  The Jenga blocks scene was about (1) (though really the movie didn't address it). 

I'm not saying Apple isn't overpriced.  There should be a risk premium.  Part of the problem with comparing to bonds is the bond market is screwed up, though perhaps starting to normalize.; >We’ve been living in a well-known, yet unpopped bubble for years


Did you miss the entirety of 2022 and 2023? June 2022 SPY closed 20% lower than it started the year at, popping the covid market bubble. It then took SPY another year to get back to previous levels. Valuations are insane right now but hard to call it a bubble.; Just look up the equity ETF AuM from 2000 until today, we went up from 102 billions to 7,87 trilions, that alone should tell you a lot about the stock markets growth; Warren isn't wrong.; >Everyone sees this; all the numbers are public

The difference isn't between then and now, it's in the nature of the securities. In 2008, all the numbers were NOT public. No one knew what was inside these complex bundled bond instruments. The public depended on the ratings agencies' valuations, and the rating agencies either didn't understand how to rate these instruments or were colluding with the banks in how risky they assessed them to be. 

There have been periods of irrational exuberance about the valuations of equities and it could be that we are in one now, but these values are not opaque and hidden from view the way the credit valuations were leading up to the Great Financial Crisis. We have Apple's financial statements. If we're so inclined, we can each make our own educated guess about what the stock is worth. This was never the case with the mortgage-backed securities and CDOs that crashed in 2008.; In regards to Apple, you're missing **services** as the breakout success over the last decade. It accounts for over a quarter of Apple's revenue, second only to iPhone. 

If you take iPhone revenue out of the equation, services makes more for Apple than all other operating segments combined.  
  
Also Apple keeps a lot of its cash offshore, mainly to avoid taxes it doesn't have to pay until it needs to, right now Apple can borrow any cash it needs at very attractive rates.   

Lastly, I think many don't realize that Apple's next big blockbuster product will be financial services, within its Apple Pay ecosystem, it captures a 0.15% fee on all transactions regardless the card issuer; scale that across a multi-trillion dollar frictionless ecosystem it positions Apple as a growth company for the next decade.

I think Apple is fairly priced.; Apple bashing thread. lol; Yup, the investment banks were leveraged up to their tits. Nobody was being responsible when it came to leverage ratios - neither the lenders, nor the borrowers. Everybody was borrowing and lending massive amounts of money that would bankrupt them if *anything* went wrong - but would allow them to make massive amounts of money if anything went right. The Big Short focused on the CDOs, but they were incidental - anything could have lit the match. 

If John lends *all* of his money to Jake, who lends all of that money to Alex, who lends all of it that money to Chris, and Chris blows the money at Las Vegas, then one stupid choice just made *four* people bankrupt. Like a chain reaction.; Even financially literate people still struggle to disconnect stock market valuations from the real economy.

A modern economy cannot function for more than a couple of hours, maybe even seconds, without credit. In 2008 the credit system froze completely - banks refused to lend to each other, let alone the public. GE couldn’t turn over their commercial paper, so they couldn’t pay wage bills or order parts.

This had a connection to asset prices - in this case housing - but a popping of a bubble doesn’t necessarily cause a recession. If the banks didn’t panic and credit didn’t freeze like it did, then you could make the argument 2008 wouldn’t have been that bad. Yes the banks would’ve booked massive losses, and you would still probably have had a recession, but without a credit crunch an economy can limp its way through until lending picks back up.

2008 is absolutely fascinating to me, one of my favourite topics to read about. We came as close as we will probably ever come to a complete collapse of the financial system. Yet, especially here in Australia, no one really cared that much. 

This is what the Big Short doesn’t go into, and fair enough, because it’s pretty boring to the average punter. Too Big Too Fail does a much better job showing the credit crisis unfolding imo.; That, and a bond pays a nominal, fixed amount. Apple is a company, with real capital, that produces real goods/services that is not fixed in price or value. Even if Apple never grows again its nominal profit will simply increase from inflation. Even if I think Apple is overvalued I may rather hold it than a 30 year treasury which has a significant chance of losing substantial value if inflation is higher than expected.; He didn't say anything about $100 b in dividends??

He said  net profit; Its true, spx/m2 is lower than '99-00. But that is basically the only time in history it is lol; Thats like saying the world is more peaceful today than 1944.; 4T, Apple is a 17% discount to that; You would need a 4 trillion dollar TIPS 30 year bond to yield 100 billion - current rate is 2.5%. Apple is trading at a 17% risk discount if we take that view."
Is PYPL a buy for 2025?,"Stock is heavily beaten down, and been on an uphill trajectory last 5 months. Currently trading at $86 with ATH \~$308.

I own Paypal. I took a risk in the low $60s because when every article in the financial press (and the journalists in the financial press are morons who only parrot what someone else is telling them) hated the stock.  Every time I asked someone about it, I got the canned answer from the negative headlines. This is when you should be interested.

Depends on your mid term market outlook and how you want to bet on it in 2025; Help me to understand their business. I personally don't use Paypal much, only for some random purchases from unfamiliar websites that don't offer Apple Pay. In 5 years, will more transactions be done with Paypal, or fewer?; I saw people asking the same thing going into 2024; SQ is better; I'll use some AI to pull data and illustrate why it trades the way it does:

Here are PayPal's annual revenues over the last five years, along with their corresponding growth rates:

- *2024*: $31.457 billion, an 8% increase from 2023 ¹
- *2023*: $29.771 billion, an 8.19% increase from 2022 ¹
- *2022*: $27.518 billion, an 8.46% increase from 2021 ¹
- *2021*: $25.371 billion, an 18.26% increase from 2020 ¹
- *2020*: $21.454 billion ¹

These growth rates indicate a steady increase in PayPal's annual revenue over the past five years, with a notable surge in 2021.

PayPal's free cash flow has seen significant fluctuations over the years. Here's a breakdown of their annual free cash flow:

- *2023*: $4.265 billion, a 16.57% decline from 2022 ¹
- *2022*: $5.112 billion, a 4.45% increase from 2021 ¹
- *2021*: $4.894 billion, a 10.58% decline from 2020 ¹
- *2020*: $5.473 billion ¹
- *2019*: $3.384 billion ¹

You will see higher prices like $300 in a very long time if the growth rates are stagnant, if they decline is will take even longer (well over a decade, you can do the math if you wish). It can happen quickly if the growth rates resume to the levels they were at when it was trading at $300. $300 it was growing at 20-25% annually now it's not even half of that. 

I've had a PayPal for over 20 years (not the stock), you could have done well buying it this year but you could have done well also buying complete garbage companies that had no business going up 50-70% or whatever it did. Personally I don't see the growth rates increasing like they did in the past at this point, Braintree is doing well but it would take ages before it makes up for a meaningful proportion of business. This is the reason I haven't bought it personally.

You could pick worse, it's at least growing modestly and profitable like a more mature company, it's fairly priced at the moment unless you think it will accelerate. If it decelerates further it is highly likely you will lose money.; I was bullish at $55-60, but at current prices I'd say no, they paid $4 Billion for honey which turned out to be a huge scam and will probably face lawsuits, and their core business faces a lot of competition.; I've owned it for a quite a while, not really sure what to do with it. My pops ran a scan on it using his software and he thinks it's going to $75, which would have me worried.; I think there are a lot more better opportunities but PYPL is not terrible compared to the other stocks on Reddit.; Google pay and Apple pay killed Paypal and Venmo. IRS also passed a new rule. If you receive more than $600 in paypal or Venno then 1099-k form will be issued. You need to pay taxes. To avoid this, everyone is now using Zelle transfers.; Paypal Mafia; Nah, this is like betting on WordPerfect against Word while Microsoft owns the entire ecosystem they run on; This has been my go to tax loss harvesting stock since 2021. That says something. I’m still harvesting my loses since 2021.; No. Paypal owns Honey, the browser extension, which will be sued, given the very strong argument from Megalag. check it out on YouTube, it’s crazy; nah, but a great tax loss harvester for 2024; Way too much competition in the fintech space, which has definitely played a big role in their steadily declining Gross Margin over the years.

Plus IMO as a non-Paypal user I would never dare touch them with a ten foot pole. I've heard WAY too many people say bad things about them on both ends of the transaction for me to ever trust them with my money. And if I'd never use their products as a user, then there's no way that I'm ever touching their stock. Maybe I'm wrong about them, but if I don't trust them enough to use their products then I can't possibly be impartial when evaluating the stock.; Past performance does not guarantee future results. Notsure how the ceo will turn this company around.; Nah they banned me. Buy Puts; Dinausore company with a dividend yield of 0%. Too expensive.; I or have heard of anyone else using paypal for years. Its done. For a fork in it.; I sold pypl last week lol. this ain't coming back up to 300 in a lifetime. Lol. Too many players in this space. Apple, Google, Square, Stripe, RazorPay might eventually win over PayPal.; I wouldn't. You be you; Paypal is no longer anything unique or leading. There are tons of alternatives and they are loosing popularity. With rise of other cash apps they are loosing their place under sun; Run; Avoid; Their moat is gone and they have too many rivals...  That being said I have used them since 1999 when I first started an eBay business.. I think there are better ideas out there; It is trap!; I cant think of a reason for paypal and ebay to exist; Hell no. Ever used them as a business theyre a nightmare also they push extreme leftist ideology.; Genuinely don’t know anyone that uses it . My homies and I all use Zelle; They lost their mojo, it's the IBM of fintechs; Pypl is dogshit and they’re kind of a piece of shit company too; dont bother 

these halfway through tech/ finance companies, are pointless

they operate at way too low margins for either or, and they have an awful reputation for withholding peoples money and such 

they dont have anything proprietary, and if any growth at all, is linear and predictable; Honey lawsuit could be an absolute disaster; Here's what I know about PayPal. I used to be good at World of Warcraft back in the day. Could throw a Fireball over them there mountains. Like ""fuck you"" good, do you hear me? I had bitches that would dance on the Ironforge mailbox when I'd walk by with my ""Gladiator"" title. 


People wanted to be me. You understand? They were willing to *pay me money* to pretend to be the internet Ass Slayer that I was. So I'd sell some high school incel in Alabama that stole his mama's credit card my account for $300 or $400 there was even an entire website dedicated to it called Markeedragon. 


So we'd use PayPal and I'd tell the pathetic loser trying to be as godlike as me that they needed to open a dispute on the transaction once I gave them my account info and then cancel the dispute. For reasons. PayPal was such a shit company that once you had opened a dispute and closed it, even if it was 3 seconds later, you could not reopen a dispute for the same transaction. Period. Even if you called and asked for a supervisor.


So once they did that my not pathetic and actually awesome self would just do the routine account recovery at Blizzard's website because back then Blizzard was actually a company sent from heaven and get my account back. Whole process would take like an hour from making an advertisement post on the forum to ruining some kid's life and having the money in my bank account. 


All thanks to PayPal. Made me the man I am today.; Kinda similar, i ended up cutting my losses with PYPL this year and put the money into an S&P 500 ETF and SOXQ. Only upside is tax harvesting for this year ; Could you explain your reasoning? All I understand so far from your comment is that you were buying the stock at crazy high prices but once it became actually cheap you don't buy; a ridiculous line of thinking in my opinion. So it must be something else.; How much you lost? Dollar amount; No one truly cares about this crap other than the Internet.; How much do you think this will affect paypal as a whole?; I wouldn't stop using Honey just because some influencers might not get their commission from affiliate links. Sounds to me like an influencer problem not a consumer problem.

I'd rather have $10 knocked off the price using a coupon I didn't know about vs some YouTuber getting their commission.; He’s got a great professional reputation.; I bought a lot at the bottom cause my dcf said it was undervalued. Now it says is close to fair value. I'm selling week by week. But also buying until I find a better stock; We have the exact same outlook.; How much do you think it will affect papyal as a whole; Snap $58.086, to be exact.; New way better ceo, beating expectations, pivoting to more profitable businesses.; Yep, I cannot make an account there for the life of me and I can't get support to help me either.

Even if I wanted to invest, I personally won't.

Paypal has likely screwed tons and tons of people as well.  I have read lots of horror stories about people losing their money and Paypal just does not care. 

Death to Paypal.; You don't even understand the issue. Honey is deceiving consumers.; Its called fraud; What motivates you to own HSY?  From what I see with a quick google check they are stagnant and trading at a 25 PE.  If you can give me a quick rundown because I love beaten down value.; Why?; The average older person in the street knows what PayPal is and what it's for and have used them it for decades. They don't know who the other guys are, and they are the ones with all the money right now and spend billions. They aren't suddenly all going to change to new brands they aren't  familiar with or trust yet overnight. It's a brand. Maybe further down the rd, it will happen. Do you trust the other brands more? Why on what footing?

Some statistics for you:

PayPal generated $29.2 billion revenue in 2023, an 7.9% increase year-on-year

PayPal net profit increased by 75% in 2023 to $4.2 billion

25 billion transactions were completed on PayPal in 2023, accounting for $1.52 trillion in transaction volume

431 million users and merchants use PayPal

It might take a while for the others to catch up.; Do you think they realized they were banning investors?

Everyone they fucked over...

Couldn't happen to a shittier company; Dividends suck.; If you’re a collector, eBay is the only legit game in town. I’m buying basketball cards off eBay damn near everyday and pay with PayPal.; I use PayPal as a proxy to pay for online purchases with a credit card. I don’t want every website to have my CC info.; You don't need to think of a reason, go read about what it does, you don't need to have an imagination to understand it lol; huh? it's literally a marketplace for anything. other services have stolen marketshare but it's legacy and will never die; Sometimes Ebay has decent deals but don’t understand Paypal existing; Etf goes down too during market crash ; ... PayPal is an Internet facing business though, it simply isn't possible to use it's products and services without it.

Your response to me sounds like someone saying ""no one cares that the owner of the local grocery store went to jail except for the locals"".; It will not affect paypal. No one can prove they lost money because only the last click will be saved as a datapoint. At best it will be an “im sorry” from honey and promises they will be more transparent in the future. They will rewrite the terms making it clear they will take your money.; Not sure but I dont like Paypal as a company in general. From scamming creators of their money, to withholding certain creator money accounts, to this Honey stuff, deceptive practises could lead to some big lawsuits. Just my two cents , DYOR; Honey controls coupon you get. So even if there is better deal you won’t get it. I rather do quick search perplexity to find one.; Yikes, you really dont know. 

It does not just hurt influencers. It also hurts consumers.

They can and do intentionally hide better discounts so you pay more money and they get more commission. 

They also sometimes intentionally dont show a coupon is available at all, when one actually is available. Meaning in many cases someone can be better off googling coupons for a few minutes instead of using Honey.; You clearly havent done your research lmao.

Honey is not only scamming the influencers but also consumers. They literally provide you with codes that do not work. Simple google searches provide you with better codes, theyre intercepting browsers with unwanted cookies and profiting off your data.

watch MegaLag’s video for more info; So you're selling it and buying it back at the same time? How's that work?; 50/50 either it goes up or it goes down; 25 PE is quite normal for HSY. The company reliably generates a 25% return on capital. My motivation is that earnings are suppressed by the short term spike in cocoa prices. That will reverse. The company will earn $12/ share in a few years. 25X12=$300 stock.; Well played; Dividends will prevent the stock price to go down and will add upside potential with annual dividend growth.

This is not a fast growing tech company, this a a payment processing company in a mature industry full of competitors.; Also good for discontinued stuff. Fragrances and other collectible shit.; Why are you saving your credit card info to websites?; At least from a consumer perspective in Germany it’s the easiest way to easily transfer money between friends to split a dinner after paying etc. as we don’t have access to apps like Venmo, that are available in for example the US. 

For every other use case there are better substitutes imo.; If spy goes down 80% were all fucked; Literally nobody cares.  Its like Albertsons buying a local grocer somewhere and them raising prices a little bit and the town griping a little bit.  Thats it.; No one cares about the honey debacle except terminally online, parasocial internet users. Which is a very few amount of people; I think there won’t even be a “we’re sorry” as that’s an admission of guilt; No surprise Peter Theil would be behind these practices.  The guy is obviously spending a boat load on PR right now to fix his image, but the fact is, he's just an incredibly self-centered person with a ruthless approach to business.; Woosh bro; One of those two things will definitely happen; Both calls and puts moment lmao; But why is a 25PE normal for a mature company paying dividends with stagnant growth?  

And why should I pay for 12/share in a few years today?; There could be some benefit though I'd rather them buy back shares instead of increasing my tax liability.; I never mentioned saving. I meant transmitting my CC info to online shops. Who the fuck knows what they do with it after.; Which other use cases and which substitutes?; You don't think people who are investing in a company care that said company is involved in a scam of likely 100s of millions of dollars? 🤡 Take; lol. The softest critique of Theil that’s humanly possible.; How did you come to that conclusion; Paying for stuff on websites mostly and substitutes for that are basically all credit and debit cards.; Taking hundreds of millions of dollars is why it’s a good buy. That’s how I know management is doing good!😂; I am investing in pypl and don´t really care honostly. Too many bullish things going on with the main businesses; Scam? For doing what all cashback sites do?; The same way you decided to ask this question; Yeah. The Honey thing is annoying but for Wall Street it’s nothing to write home about. It’s not a ball busting scandal on national news. It’s annoying but it *really doesn’t matter all that much*."
$GSAT: The Overlooked Satellite Company With Extraterrestrial Potential,"**TLDR: Globalstar’s outsized role in Low-Earth Orbit communications and recent equity partnership with Apple will provide substantial future cash flows and support rapid growth. Price target is $5, but will very likely extend far above this valuation.**  


Globalstar ($GSAT) provides Mobile Satellite Services through its satellite constellations worldwide. More specifically, they provide cellular data and enable cellular communication, satellite monitoring of ground assets by governments, emergency service to remote areas, and utilization of their frequency spectrums authorized by the FCC and ITU (most importantly). 

[Globalstar recognizes revenue from its Spectrums under the “Wholesale capacity services” segment, and its respective 51&#37; and 31&#37; increases for the 3\/9 month periods ending in 2024 compared to 2023 illustrates its importance as a driver of operating profits.](https://preview.redd.it/7aitpeu2ug9e1.png?width=1099&format=png&auto=webp&s=79a85edf5fb76472b8c076573edd6d8861479b5c)

[Revenue has been steadily increasing, even through rocky macroeconomics](https://preview.redd.it/o1b7g5ecug9e1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=be6fa6c5d32200883db22aff0379bde53bbb2e96)

Authorizations for ownership of terrestrial spectrums are often lengthy endeavors and require a demonstration of competence by any company seeking them. The fact that Globalstar has secured L-band and S-band spectrum authorizations gives it a massive competitive advantage and access to a wider variety of international populations and markets than competitors.



In addition to this competitive advantage, Apple recently initiated a 20% stake in the company and provided them with $1.1 billion in funding (paid in quarterly installments) to pay down debts and for use of their services. This 20% equity stake emphasizes that Apple views Globalstar as a company with significant growth potential rather than a simple operating partner. 



And it’s not just Apple buying in either…

Institutional ownership of Globalstar is up across the board, with names like JPMorgan and Fidelity rebalancing their investments and taking stakes outright.

I believe that Globalstar’s current undervaluation is due to its historic balance sheet weakness and continued share dilution. However, the $1.1B in funding from Apple provides it with a solid runway and cushion from debt. 

More recently, they filed to effect a reverse stock split. This split would address their ongoing share dilution issues, provide additional liquidity for lot trading (blocks of 100 shares that benefit from lower commissions and fees), and a path to NASDAQ listing.

I believe that this company’s valuation currently reflects outdated historic data, and is not priced appropriately given these most recent developments. The consensus price target is currently set at $5, but having been beaten down for nearly 2 decades, I would expect any spark to ignite a rally that extends far above this target.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hnqndn/gsat_the_overlooked_satellite_company_with/,172,2024-12-27 23:21:44,"# **TLDR**

**Ticker:** GSAT

**Direction:** Up

**Prognosis:** Strong Buy

**Price Target:** $5 (but potentially much higher)

**Reasoning:**  Globalstar ($GSAT) is undervalued due to past balance sheet issues, but a recent $1.1B investment from Apple (20% equity stake) and increasing institutional ownership signals significant future growth potential.  A planned reverse stock split should improve liquidity and pave the way for a NASDAQ listing.  Revenue is also significantly increasing.; Is Globalstar the website where all the black kids yell ""GlobalStar Hip-Hop!"" Before they fight each other?; Position:

Jeez how underutilized was their network lol; Wasn't there insider buying of $2m shares this week. It's either a bold move or something could be brewing; JM has been buying stock post investor day consistently. Only the earnings blackout date (starts Monday) will prevent him from continuing to buy more.

Value investors are often early to the game - case in point!; how do their satellites compare to Starlink? If it's like 20yr old tech, seems pretty useless for any future needs. If you told me they've been launching state of the art satellites and this was Apple's ""in"" to bypass cellular network providers, I'd yolo my rent right now.; Honest question… has a reverse split EVER been a good thing and worked out?; Lmao..it will remain overlooked because it has nothing new to offer; After rs worth watching.

The stock price is giving the illusion that it's cheap but at a $4B market cap, the risk reward ratio just isn't there.; Will this technology help with the Apple Watches that are on their own private line?

GSAT doesn't seem like much growth capabilities based on the below.

how does $GSAT satellites compare to Starlink's constellation of satellites

Comparing Globalstar ($GSAT) satellites to Starlink's constellation involves looking at several key aspects such as satellite numbers, technology, service capabilities, and operational strategies:  
Number and Scale of Satellites:

* Starlink: As of recent updates, Starlink boasts a constellation of over 6,000 satellites, with plans to expand to significantly more. This large number of satellites allows for extensive coverage and redundancy, aiming to provide global broadband internet service from low Earth orbit (LEO).
* Globalstar: Globalstar operates with a much smaller constellation, currently around 48 satellites, focusing on satellite phone and low-speed data services rather than high-speed broadband.

Orbit and Technology:

* Starlink: Utilizes LEO satellites at approximately 550 km altitude, which results in lower latency and higher data transfer rates compared to traditional geostationary orbit (GEO) satellites. Starlink satellites are equipped with advanced technology like space lasers for inter-satellite communication, enhancing the network's efficiency.
* Globalstar: Its satellites are in LEO but at a higher altitude than Starlink's, around 1,414 km. They primarily use S-band for communication, which is more suited for voice and basic data services rather than high-speed internet.

Service and Coverage:

* Starlink: Aims for global coverage, offering high-speed internet with speeds up to 220 Mbps, though actual speeds can vary. It's targeting both residential and mobile users, including those in remote areas where traditional internet infrastructure is lacking.
* Globalstar: Focuses on providing reliable satellite phone services, IoT solutions, and asset tracking. While it does offer data services, these are not as comprehensive or fast as Starlink's offerings, being more geared towards niche markets like emergency communications, maritime, and rural areas where even basic connectivity is needed.

Business Model and Market Position:

* Starlink: Operates on a subscription model, with a significant upfront cost for the user terminal (dish) and monthly fees. It has rapidly expanded its user base, targeting millions of subscribers globally.
* Globalstar: Has a different market focus, with services aimed at specific sectors rather than mass consumer broadband. Its business model includes contracts with government and industrial users for communications solutions.

In summary, while both companies operate LEO satellite systems, Starlink focuses on high-speed internet with a massive satellite constellation for global coverage, whereas Globalstar emphasizes reliability and specialized communication services with a smaller satellite network. Their technologies, market focuses, and scale of operations differ significantly.; 1/10 r/s are done by companies on their way UP, this is one

If GSAT takes a hit due to the split I am buying as many shares as I can get my hands on; Appreciate your honesty DJ, that is a good question.; The future I’m seeing is quantum satellite communication. 

China’s already done it, and Globalstar is already positioned to make the pivot.; Thats X4 leverage only, not that cheap; See my post.; As of 2025 it will offer voice memos but realtime two-way talk is further out; Yes, that's the whole aim to make text messaging easier.  I think that's the reason why Apple bought 20% of GStar; ASTS has had too many convenient delays, private placement warrants outstanding, and fair value of warrant liability miscalculations that make me extremely nervous to be an investor; 👍🙌Also…New Globalstar CEO Paul Jacob’s (former CEO of Qualcomm) and many of his people followed him to Globalstar!; You lack patience brother; ...and might also have been priced in.; No I wrote the last one in 2022, this one is more up to date; Completely different business model, not in competition with starlink; january what, 17th?; They have the option to split, but if natural demand drives the price higher then they won’t necessarily need to. Either way, I expect the price appreciation pre or post-split to be the same.; SpaceX doesn’t have the authorization for 1.6/2.4 GHz frequency bands, which allows for military channels and undisrupted access due to hardly any congestion. 

SpaceX petitioned the FCC for authorization but was denied, so they use a common channel and adjust their tech to work as well as it can in that congested band.

Currently, only GSAT and Iridium have access.; Care to back that up brother or are we just saying stuff; Hahaha.  I couldn't find Worldstar on Hargreaves.; So it is going to reverse?; It’s Valhalla or government assistance for us now brother; I took a long-term equity position - I don’t have any calls. I would go for the Jan 17th 1.5 though if you plan on trading options and see if you can get it for $60-65. Otherwise, you can buy 100 shares for $200ish and sell covered puts if the liquidity is there

I don't know man, who TF can tell the future, all quantum/nuclear stocks traded at penny level just last month ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271).  ASTS traded mid-30s couple months ago.

To me the chance this stock goes back to pre-Apple's deal (which was officially announced last month) is small, so why not?; lol being able to send a text message to anyone, even in the most remote of places is very helpful.

If you buy the same option but for Jan 2026, then you have a whole year for the share price to go ballistic. In this case the premium is not even that much more. Options that are ITM have intrinsic value and a delta relatively close to 1, so even if its far out, should the share price goes ballistic, your options are worth a lot more too because they’re exercisable right away.; Thanks; So true. These regards think that companies like fucking Apple and Microsoft just toss billions into guesses.; I'm pretty sure Apple considered all of this very carefully, and we don't yet know what they have planned but they seem to be in a pretty good spot right now. But hey, you guys are certainly geniuses so maybe they, one of the GOAT companies in the world, should just listen to a couple of random jamokes instead. Just kidding. They shouldn't.; It doesn't mean it's a good investment? They just want to bring the technology in-house.

They spent a few hundred mill on a stake in the company when they are worth $3T 

This lets them have a say in what the company does and how they operate.; The bot knows fuck all; Reverse splits understandably get a bad wrap because of how often they’re used to regain compliance with the $1 per share minimum. However, GSAT is already compliant without the reverse split and is most likely using it to reduce the number of shares outstanding - which would address its dilution problem, give it marketability to funds whose investments are limited to stocks over a certain dollar amount, and provide relief if it is being “shadow boxed” by algorithmic trading; Exactly. RS is a huge red flag even in this case. They are purposely holding the share price down to justify the reverse split. It wouldn’t be necessary if they simply stopped manipulating the share price and allowed it to go up after the Apple news like it should have. This would mean they would have to pay their shareholders which they do not intend to do. It’s shady as hell. They should, at a minimum, provide some details about the RS such as exactly when it’s going to occur and what the split rate will be. They have been very vague about this and it’s because they want people to think they may not reverse split. They are going to reverse split. It’s their way to screw shareholders. No I don’t need a lesson in how reverse splits work. They are a red flag all around in every situation. At a minimum it means the stock has been grossly mismanaged.; Recently Blacksky; Chesapeake Energy Corporation... now EXE; Roflmao you’re joking right? How about Tesla?; Most exchanges offer liquidity rebates to High frequency trading firms like Citadel, Two Sigma, Flow Traders, etc. for adding liquidity/market depth to order books (I.e. buying and selling shares). These rebates are typically based on the quantity of shares traded, so these firms will often target low value stocks and keep them range-bound by placing limits on both sides of the spread and farming the rebates.

You can see this in most stocks under $2-3 -  the candles are usually precise and robotic like the image

So, great title, DontHitTurtles however you got there.; Interesting rebuttal; I read [here](https://investors.globalstar.com/news-releases/news-release-details/globalstar-achieves-first-5g-data-call-xcom-ran-band-n53) they did a 5G test with the new CEO's startup tech. I have no tech background to know if it's legit.

Anyone knows ASTS tech can chime in? I missed ASTS and consider to jump in this stock. Apple is not a random company, the fact they bought stake in this company is good news. But they can also be wrong ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); If they make the move into quantum communication, they could effectively become a cybersecurity company; Well it can, you'll be -85 per contract tho. You need it to reach it 3.85 and only then you have x4 leverage over just buying share. Not worth the risk imo, i would rather buy shares likes op if i like the stock; lol what? “Communication” is not a business model; I think that Elon tends to overstep, and that Trump doesn’t like to be overshadowed. If at any point he feels that Elon is being credited more than him for anything, he may get him out of the spotlight ASAP.

However if the two powerhouses can coexist without bruised egos, then there is a chance that Musk and his companies do receive preferential treatment for sure. That’s a risk I’m willing to take at GSAT’s current valuation though; Not guaranteed though; They literally do. Look at Cisco; They spent a few hundred mill *in addition to* the $1.1B in cash they gave them. The fact that Apple even sees enough in their operations to want to have a say in what this company does is significant.; GSAT does texting only over satellite's where as ASTS does full 5G data speed over 20Mbpa and up to 120Mbps. Their not even comparable. 

GSATs 5G is not for their satellite business it's a different product.

ASTS makes GSAT obsolete in 18 months. The stocks down 40% of the recent run up. A great time to buy. $12B mktcap for a company analysts project to be doing $4.5B annual revenue this decade (and that's a very low estimate); I read that also. Theoretical quantum communication pivot aside, the business is already fundamentally sound and growing as is.; Good luck if you invest based on if they make the move.; Yeah ok there’s no communication companies - thanks

They haven’t done shit in 35 years and todays not the day that changes; Starlink is a different business model, we aren’t in competition, and Elon won’t get anywhere trying to step on regulators just because he’s  buddies with DJT (for now); It's not guaranteed? No fucking shit; Cisco is huge though; You’re forgetting how much cash Apple has; It's just a footnote that they can use to sell iPhones and make commercials about and keeping it from Androids

""Look how cool the new iPhone is, it has this worthless feature you'll never use""

That's literally the purpose. It's garbage; Why do you keep just using the word quantum in relation to this company? ; *This “pivot.” Is it in the room with us now?*

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*; I’m not. I’m investing based on everything I wrote above.; I’m not forgetting, it’s a supporting factor in my investment decision; Apple has been GSAT’s largest customer since September of 2022 - we’ve already been using the features they provide. Their original agreement allotted 85% of their network capacity to Apple exclusively.

If Apple thinks the service they provide is worth taking a reportable stake to protect, then the service provided must be valuable. Apple not only took a large enough stake to become a minority interest, but handed them $1.1B unrelated to the equity transaction so they can scale. 

This most recent agreement guarantees revenue while allowing them to pay down debt and focus on growth.; Because the original question was about what new service I see them offering in the future.; Well part of your argument hinges on the fact that them investing in 20 percent is significant. But to Apple that 20 percent is largely insignificant when compared to their cash pile. Honestly the 20 percent investment is lends more credence to the idea that they bought the stake to make sure the technology stays in house not that the stock is going to rocket up; Nah it's a relatively cheap marketing ploy for apple 

They don't offer a useful service and no one cares about it, sorry to burst your bubble

But put your money in this trash and let me know how it works out for ya champ; The Apple stake is significant to me because GSAT is a 4b market cap company that is now backed by the reputation and credit of the single largest Tech company on the planet. I’m not interested in the percentage invested relative to Apple’s cash balance. I only care that GSAT will now have $1.1B more than it did before, and that it will be used to provide a service that Apple deemed so necessary that they took a minority interest in the company itself to protect it. 

It also tells me that Apple’s interests are now (financially and operationally) aligned with GSAT’s, and that they are willing to finance GSAT to protect those interests. Not buying the company outright indicates that Apple *needs* GSAT to continue operating as its own company, because they don’t know how to manage or run a satellite telecommunications company themselves. 

Apple now relies on this service that is important to its own operations, but can’t provide for itself. It’s not the exact $ amount of the stake that matters, but the implication that this 4b market cap company holds leverage over Apple’s operations in some way.; A cheap marketing ploy relative to the amount of funding they provided in this agreement would have been buying out every 30 second Super-bowl ad slot for the next 2 years ($840m). 

Your logic isn’t tracking; Haters dont see the whole picture here

Apple has long hated the ugly black mark on their otherwise glistening customer experience of having to depend on MNOs/carriers

If I was Apple, I’d have thought long and hard about what it would take to bypass carriers without needing to build cell towers, and if I had a decent idea, I’d be slowly implementing it on a global scale in a quiet way 

Find My network recruits operationalizes strangers’ Apple devices as nodes in a mesh network

N53/XCOM RAN/Sat connectivity and probably some patents and tech that Apple owns could probably enable a basic connectivity, sans ATT/verizon etc, that comes baked in to hardware for people who are mostly on WiFi anyway and sometimes need to text someone or access maps while driving

If such connectivity sells just 5% more iPhones, you’ve now expanded market share, made some billions and locked up a new crop of Apple hardware/software/services customers 

People don’t want to pay for satellite/mobile service on its own, but they definitely want to get it for “FREE” with purchased of a new iPad mini; I won’t say it’s impossible but I don’t think you’ll see drastic upward price movement. I could be wrong so we’ll have to wait and see. Good luck

Also the market doesn’t always respond in the way you think. I prefer companies like RKLB and PL with good foundation and management. And both have  strong paths towards profitability and are slightly pushed forward by some hype and products that are targeted and competitive. 

The docu wild wild space is pretty interesting and covers topics relevant to GSAT as well; GSAT makes a product that's worthless to everyone

We can agree on that, yes? Cool 

Apple buys it up and uses it for exclusivity in their phones cause their customers are morons

""iPhone means safety and security and peace of mind no matter where you are in the world"" - some bullshit like that.

That's how apple has to differentiate their overpriced trash from android now. 

Luckily their customers are idiots and lap it up. 

Glad I could explain it to you. GSAT is a worthless company with a product no one wants or cares about.

Go dump your money into it though, enjoy the 'gains'"
Riding the AI Wave for all of 2025,"Disclaimer: Novice investor here.



65/M a couple years from retirement. Besides some investment accounts that are diversified appropriately for my age and situation, I've got an IRA with $150K that I want to roll the dice with. I was going to configure this IRA with a 100% S&P 500 index fund, but now I'm thinking of doing something different.



Instead I want to take the entire $150K IRA and split it up evenly between these 7 stocks:

Alphabet

Amazon

Apple

Microsoft

NVIDIA

Broadcom

Palantir



My plan is to keep this portfolio for all of 2025. Then in January 2026 I'll diversify it appropriately.



This AI Wave is riding high right now, and I think it has the potential to go even higher before it starts to crest, which presents an opportunity to take advantage of that really doesn't come around too often.



If this 7-stock portfolio can beat the S&P 500 for 2025, I'll be happy. I think it has a good chance of doing so.



Critique this 7-stock portfolio please.

",https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1hno9pv/riding_the_ai_wave_for_all_of_2025/,29,2024-12-27 21:36:09,"Whats the point? These are pretty much the top holdings in any 401k or etf.; BBAI; Your portfolio is already an index fund ; That troll was an AI 🤖; You might see the most profits with PLTR. 

Im all in PLTR, sold the rest of my mag 7 

Good idea maybe not, no risk no reward.; I got Apple from stock-split at 119.5 for 100 shares in Oct, 2020. Google from stock-split at 138 for 220 shares after Aug. 2022. I should have got in when their price drop below my buy price. I did have TSM at 118 for 400 shares.

I am collecting NVDA shares one by one bw 130-150 for 10. I am not sure if I can get more before it hits 200. I wonder whether I should have saved my money in lump sum to buy NVDA just like I did with AAPL, GOOG, TSM instead of one by one. I missed last two stock split with NVDA without cash in hand.

I am not sure how these performance compared with SP 500 from 2020 to now.

This is my result from these stocks. It should run the same or better in coming years.; Replace NVDA with RKLB.  NVDA is dead money for 2 years.; As I said in another post, I would do 75-80% in MAGS, 10-12.5% in PLTR, 10-12.5% in AVGO.. I would also DCA into these positions. If you purchase all of your shares at once then you’re at risk of buying right before the price drops. I would spend like 25% of the money every 2 weeks so that you’re fully invested after 2 months. If the price drops from the current levels you will benefit from it. If the price goes up then you’re not missing out on the gains waiting for the price to drop; As others have pointed out, most of the stocks are going to be in the funds that you already hold. Palantir is a good one but has been on an insane tear

if you like AI, think about a quantum Stock like IONQ.

if you want to roll dice, look into a mag 7 dividend fund like YMAG

if you want to play individual stocks for fun, look into wheeling or covered calls on those stocks

this is not advice because I’m not a professional. I’m just a stranger on the Internet.

Good luck and have fun!; Smart money has been exiting these names. I like the strategy but not the companies.; SOUN 

quantum computing is taking off too check that sector out; I would swap out NVIDIA with TSM.

Why?  Market share.  TSM produces most of the world’s microchips and by a large margin.

For geopolitical reasons I feel it is undervalued and with the necessity of high end microchips in AI development I think it has a lot of potential for growth.

It’s up almost 100% over the past year and it has a good chance of going up another.

Anyways, give it a look, I’ve had it for two years with no plans on selling anytime soon.; You prolly want to diversify amongst micro-caps vs. major caps- and one ☝️ very effective element of seeking alpha is size (volume) and price- per share.
50% move on a  $6000 worth of stock will be dependent on QTY of shares, if you have 12 NFLX, its not getting the sparks you would for investing the same $6 k on  $3 stock that does 50% (2000  x 1.50) , additionally a stock that takes off from 1-3$ will double and triple more quickly if it catches momentum. I like to put 30% into small stocks that have the potential of being bought, breakthrough, or undiscovered.  See MYO for last 18 months.
See CELH for 5 year chart. 
I especially love Biotechs that have a 5 or 10 year chart from $100 to under $5 , because with any good news they will retrace to 25-50% quickly. 
See MGNX.; We’re in the second inning of the 9 inning AI takeover. We’ve only just begun; also some penny stocks like IonQ and RGTI; Why not simply buy $VOO?; Don't double down on what everyone has already doubled down on 7 times.

Eventually, the price has to come back down to meet value.

You have recency bias because of how stocks have been behaving. This is not the norm. Expecting it to be the new norm is foolish.; It sounds like an exciting plan! Investing in these seven tech stocks could be promising given the current AI wave. However, be mindful of concentration risk and market volatility. Diversifying and regular rebalancing can help manage risk.

Best of luck with your portfolio in 2025!; If you must do one of these & want maximum returns, go balls put on PLTR. This is the way. That $150k has the potential to double or triple next year alone. But you may not have the balls for going “maximum returns”…respectfully of course; Why does OP write this like an LLM prompt; Anybody have insights into IONQ RGTI POET; Why does this reddit written like an llm prompt

Also where is GOOG; Boring.; True. But I want to focus on these 7 individual AI stocks for maximum returns.; Thanks, just read that BBAI has a positive forecast for 2025.; Sure, BBAI have good time in 2025; Right, I realized that after I posted. There are a few MAG7 Index funds out there. But they don't include Broadcom and Palantir.

So maybe what I should do is go with the following:
33% MAG7 Index fund
33% Broadcom
34% Palantir; What would your AI centered portfolio for 2025 look like?; IonQ Is $45.  It should also fall because they don't make money yet.  Also because I sold after it tripled and I thought it was already at an absurd price($25); He’s 65 years old and trying to retire.. the high potential of those companies also comes with high risk; I want to focus on just these 7 individual stocks for maximum returns.; Understood. Good points.



That said, even though the CAPE ratio for the MAG 7 is much too high, I've still heard a good many positive 2025 forecasts for the MAG 7 (valuations be damned), as well as for AVGO and PLTR. 



Maybe I should scale back and try something else. Being that this IRA already has the $150K at 100% in an S&P 500 index fund, and at a minimum I was going to leave it that way, I could do a variation on that:



$100K - S&P 500 index fund

$25K - AVGO

$25K - PLTR



That way I'll still get the MAG 7, as well as AVGO and PLTR.



Or, I could be even more aggressive and do this:



$50K - S&P 500 index fund

$50K - AVGO

$50K - PLTR





Would this be a little more realistic?; I bought both Ionq and POET a few months ago. I am VERY VERY happy with both stocks. Watch Soundhound as well!!; GOOG is there. First one on the list:
Alphabet; I would check out not yet expanded AI plays. RaaS is going to be the next step, plus tailored AI solutions.  SaaS is also going to connect the cloud and data to AI, so check out what will be the infrastructure to current AI plays that went hot the past few years.

The speculation on these is what is driving the quantum names through the roof right now, you got to be a step ahead of it if you want to see some numbers, especially for a sit and hold for a year play.

I just think those names are good, but worn out at this point. Also check out the ipo market. For 150k you can get into cerebras (or onlyfans if they go public) cerebras might be able to compete with Nvidia, it would be a score if it works, but it's also a gamble...; No. MAG7 should have a bigger weight. If those are the companies you want then I would invest 75-80% in MAGS, 10-12.5% in PLTR, 10-12.5% AVGO… this would give you a near equal weighting in every company; Ignore AI providers and look at software companies that quickly pick up clients while showcasing AI use cases in their company blog posts. Avoid anyone talking about genAI.

Look at existing mid cap software companies that are pivoting into AI offerings.

AI will be similar to the dotcom boom and there will be long term winners. The question is figuring out who’s actually implementing it, selling it well, and staying efficient as a business. Pick hardware or cloud AI providers for value stocks or software providers for growth stocks.

Additionally, watch for efficient mid/large cap companies that are acquiring AI companies in similar sectors, as these guys will squeeze extra cash out of these novel offerings.

Avoid AI ETFs and index funds or anything that will get on the general industry and instead bet on specific winners.

There will be some exceptions to these guidelines, but imo this is the way to capitalize on this new technology. Treat it like a potential way to make software and business more efficient, not a new industry. Whoever does that the best will be the big winners. It could be any company from healthcare to trucking/logisitics, but it’s all about improvements to business efficiency.; yea you are right ☹️; PLTR has a forward P/E of 172 

Good is 20 or less.

Bad is 30 or more

I don't care if you like the company or think it's the most amazing thing on the planet. Let's say that's true

You're buying $1 of **expected** future earnings for $172.

There are just better places to put your money. It's silly.

If you're new, you have zero context for normal or a downturn or a crash.

These things happen. These things aren't rare.

The best places for $ right now are TLT, KMLM, soft commodities like CORN, SOYB.

Or in your bank waiting to be used when the market corrects or completely shits its pants.; Thanks for the info.; You have any in particular u like?; Thanks for breaking it down; that gives me a clearer picture of what an ABSURDLY high forward P/E really means.



Do you know where online I can check a stock's forward P/E? I'd like to take a look at some of the MAG 7 and \*maybe\* go with one or two of those instead of PLTR.



So you're recommending a Bond ETF like TLT, a Futures ETF like KMLM, or Commodities like CORN and SOYB? For what purpose? To preserve capital for when the inevitable market correction comes, and then buy the dip in the S&P 500?; For your situation, I would not invest in quantum.. they have seen insane run ups over the last couple weeks and at these companies are nowhere near profitability.

With your situation, you want to maximize the upside but limit the downside and the quantum plays aren’t going to do that.

The focus should be on high market cap companies that are well established. If I were you, I would only invest in companies with 100b+ market cap; Have you considered modular nuclear energy powering AI and quantum? 

That will be another part of this whole revolution I believe.; Tem, rxrx, cour and path for raw AI plays. Intc and cerebras when they ipo for chips. Optt, ktos drs onds for drone and robotics.  Heavy spec plays on mbot and ekso, serious casino on these. 

There are a few more but that's what I can rattle off, baba to get some Chinese AI too.

Also, did you hear OF might IPO!? Tell me that won't make money!; You can literally usually just Google forward p/e for most stocks. It'll give you sources.

You should also look at the Buffet Indicator.

Stocks are in a *massive* overvalued state. 2 standard deviations off normal.

Can it continue? Sure.

Is that the best bet to make? Absolutely not. That's trading based on sentiment, not value. Sentiment turns on a dime. Price cannot deviate from value forever.

TLT: Bonds are at massive low prices. Like hugely oversold. They are safe haven asset. If the economy goes to shit or the market dumps, they spike. Bonds also move non-correlative to stocks a lot, so this is a way to diversify and hedge instead of putting more chips on a stock market bet.

That said, if the Fed raises or stops cutting rates, TLT will continue to fall.

Scenario 1 is more likely than scenario 2. 

Buying a stable asset at huge lows, hoping for a move up, is less risky than buying things that are overbought at all-time highs, hoping they'll go higher.

KMLM is non correlated to the stock market, so it's a useful hedge. If you already have a bunch of money in the general stock market, you don't want to just keep putting money into the general stock market. 

Soft commodities do well in recessions compared to a lot of other things. It's the same idea as a JNJ PG, consumer staples type trade. Broke people still buy toilet paper, toothpaste and bread. 

Bear in mind, soft commodities are subject to a lot of price volatility because of crop yields, oil prices, etc.

Commodities are, again, a way for you to stop dumping all your money into one kind of asset in 10 different ways.

There a lot of ETFs and funds that are way overweighted in overvalued tech. I'm sure you have a lot of them in your portfolio. You're loaded for bear with risk.

Don't dump more money into the same stocks, the same sector, etc.

You're 65. You need to hedge and take fewer risks. I know things look good now but, and this is just a thought experiment - how would things look if all your stocks dumped 40%?

If you're still totally comfortable with how that looks, then invest all you want in a sentiment, market euphoria trade. 

It's just not the best play, in my opinion.

And yes, the idea is that TLT KMLM go up as stocks decline, and then you use those profits to buy stock or VOO when prices aren't comically high.; >Is that the best bet to make? Absolutely not. That's trading based on sentiment, not value. Sentiment turns on a dime. Price cannot deviate from value forever.

Excellent way to put it. Great advice.

>

I've got another IRA that's diversified appropriately, which I don't have to touch right now. And I have two years of expenses in T-Bills. And I'll start taking SS at FRA, two years from now. So the way I look at it, if I went through with this now, and my stocks dumped 40%, I've got at least two years to ride it out and wait for a recovery.



Like I said as a novice investor the purpose of my post was to hear back from experienced investors. I totally appreciate your feedback, you definitely know what you're talking about, and it will factor on whether I go through with this or not. At the very least you've clearly shown me that this would be even more of a long shot and riskier than I initially thought.; All good. I'm glad I'm being of some use.

Two years **is not** a long period of time for a recovery.

Again, recency bias makes you believe that. You don't have broader context.

We've had this insane bull run. In 5 years, the S&P has gone up 151.8%. The average return for 5 years should be 35%-50%

1 year shows a 28% gain. Average should be 7%-10%.

We've had 3x the regular amount of growth we should, and people think that's normal because why wouldn't they? They've only seen this window of the market

But all that growth came from literal free money being given out all over the world and banking rates dropping to zero around the world. Corporate buybacks artificially bloating stock prices. Everyone in the world suddenly becoming a stock experts, trading millions on their phones while they're on the toilet.

What got us here doesn't exist in the economy any more. A correction is **long** overdue. If price to earnings is 40x or 172x earnings have to come up or price has to go down. Earnings aren't going to come up fast enough.

But the general advice you'll get from uneducated investors will be ""buy and hold"" ""dollar cost average down"" ""stocks always go up"".

These things are thoughtless clichés parotted over and over. They were introduced by investment companies and banks as strategies to keep people invested.

As a friend who works for Fidelity says, ""The stock market goes up because it has to go up. If it doesn't, the whole economy blows up.""

They need people invested, or they don't make their commissions, expense ratios, consulting fees, etc.

The truth is that stocks do go up. And if you had always invested the same amount every week for the whole time the stock market has been around, you would be massively wealthy. 

But you'd be dead.

The other truth is, there have been frequent, long periods of time where stocks dropped and didn't recover for decades. Of went flat after a drop.

We're talking periods of 10, 15, 30+ years.

I've gone through the S&P in other posts to cite these specific times. There are lots.

I'm not saying that **will** happen, but it **can** and **does** happen.

I'm helping my parents navigate their retirement now, so the dollars and cents of it are all very real when you sit down and plan it out. You have to be realistic.

Your money is locked up in stocks/T-bills (you'd have to look up each fund to see what stocks it has), and you're looking at retiring.

Your goal shouldn't be taking on more risk. It should be security and a good, stable return.

It's not sexy, fun stuff but neither is trying to pay hospital bills when you have no money when you're 80.

So: 

If you put that $150K into a 4% savings account, then by the time you're 75, it'll be $225K. Zero risk.

If you put it into the stock market and you get a normal return of 7%-10%, you'll have $290K - $395K

If you put it into the market and the market drops 20% and then doesn't go up, you have $120K in 10 years (and your other stocks will drop too, obviously)

If you invest in stocks that are overvalued and the market drops, your $150K becomes $75K pretty quick.

I can't tell you what is right for you. Just make sure that you're fully aware of all the scenarios, including the absolute worst."
Advice,"Advice needed. I'm an inexperienced stock trader. During the COVID-19 crash in 2020, I bought $15,000 worth of random stocks: Boeing, Delta, Spirit Airlines, Spirit AeroSystems, MGM, Disney, Apple, and JetBlue, as recommended by my coworkers at the firehouse dinner table. Spirit Airlines has filed for bankruptcy, so I hold worthless shares.
 
I also sold some stocks this year with an $8,000 profit:
Delta - 160 shares at $50 for a +97% return & Apple - 4 shares at $228 for a +72% return.
 
What should I do with the remaining stocks, hold or sell?
 
Disney - 2 shares @ $86.45: Currently +29% 
JetBlue - 55 shares @ $5.40: Currently +44% 
Spirit Airlines - 949 shares @ $6.06: Currently -94% 
MGM - 35 shares @ $12.24: Currently +185% 
Spirit AeroSystems - 100 shares @ $20: Currently +69% 
Boeing - 35 shares @ $142: Currently +26% 
 
 
The remaining stocks are currently showing -12%. I know Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems have some potential. I'm considering selling my Spirit stocks this year to offset my long-term capital gains. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you!

Lol; **Contact a financial advisor to get some real help**. General advice is to buy VOO and watch it tick up over decades. Short-term you can still lose badly in VOO.

How do you assess if you’ve missed a stocks run?,"Amateur investor here, seeking to learn.

Much to my regret I’ve stayed away from Apple, Nvidia, Tesla etc over the past few years thinking they must be at the end of their run and future growth has been priced in to the stock price based on the p/e. In that time I’ve still done well enough on more conservative stock choices but I’m left with FOMO for the crazy gains I could have had.

Even now when I look at Nvidia I wonder if there’s still room to go up. I look at Apple and think they’ve not released much innovation of note lately (I use a lot of their products) and Tesla seems to be way overpriced compared to other car manufacturers (and Elon looks to be playing with fire)

Am I thinking about this all wrong?",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hncoei/how_do_you_assess_if_youve_missed_a_stocks_run/,116,2024-12-27 12:08:08,"In this case, it's more about your emotion than the valuation. I would argue that if you thought they were at the end of their runs few years, you would probably sell quickly before. The difficult part is to manage your emotions. 

You decided it was too risky and too overvalued at that time, stick to it and find other opportunites. They are not the only companies in the world.; For me, a very important thing is having a strong thesis and one where I can sort of build out a realistic ""story arc"" in my mind.  I really do try to actively look for things early - both individual names but also broader themes. It's easier to be long-term about something and let it play out when you were early and your cost basis is low. I do think that the people late to an investment party are often the first ones out the moment things get a little volatile. The people who have a cost basis 50% lower and who have been holding for a year are not thrilled but less easily shaken out than the person who FOMO'd in and now is seeing the position in the red every time they look. As someone else noted in the comments, emotions are a big part of investing and it's important to do whatever you can to manage them (low cost basis, understanding your risk tolerance, appropriate allocation, etc)

I also do focus on things that I think that are likely more ""built to last."" An example of this was buying nuclear power plant stocks late last year/early this year on AI power demand, which played out better than I'd expected for what I thought was a relatively low-key way to play AI demand. 

 If I'm buying something that's done well there has to be some thought as to what can still play out (are there aspects to the story that can branch out?), what's underappreciated, etc. I think today ""sheer demand""/flows is an element that can take a popular story higher than expected but that isn't ultimately sustainable and eventually things become overcrowded - you get that long ""(fill in the blank popular stock) only goes up"" escalator up, people get complacent, FOMO and then when something gets wildly overcrowded you get the eventual elevator down. 

For a bigger theme, optimally I'd like to have a satisfying allocation to it, do well then eventually lessen. If after I lessen it's very clear that there's some more to go, I may re-up a little bit on dips but not likely take it back up to the allocation it was. There are times when I'll just remove a theme entirely that's a sizable allocation because I feel it's largely played out and something is more interesting. 

I have to be interested in the business, as well or else it just gets eventually bumped for more 
of something else where I am interested. There are times when there's a good story but one that gets wildly ahead of itself. I thought CAVA was kind of interesting and traded it early on - did not expect to see it do what it did. I look at that and go, ""I'm not *that* interested"" in the core story. CAVA is CAVA and people like the restaurants but it's a singular restaurant chain (unless they buy something else) it's not a larger/broader theme or something where you can realistically see multiple use cases branching off. The ""story arc"" is not a bad story but it's also not very expansive.

At what point does the valuation per restaurant get absurd? It can get a lot more absurd than one would think but I look at that and worry that it's an escalator up/eventual elevator down and the people who bought at some ludicrous valuation (I think it was around $50M per restaurant at one point recently; Chipotle is around half that - CAVA's per restaurant valuation is ""unprecedented"" - https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZoh5asXIA8UPTu?format=png&name=medium) might have a long wait as bagholders if that isn't sustainable and people eventually pile out. Talking about a ""story arc"" - that feels like it skipped ahead several chapters and will eventually have to go back and read them over again. 

And there are things that I miss that were ultimately more sustainable stories than I thought. Sometimes I was simply wrong and what's the takeaway? 

Sometimes people over-extrapolate potential negatives to a story. I think that's perhaps going on to some degree with UBER currently. I do have some concerns with the longer-term and I don't think the company has presented an entirely clear vision of its place in transportation 5-10 years from now but Google announces a new city for Waymo and people sell Uber as if what *may* be 5 years from now is 5 months from now. The AV cloud will probably continue to sit over Uber until they convince investors otherwise but the selling from that will (and probably has) get overdone, at least in the short-term.

I do think that this is a market now more than ever where people pile into winners to a degree not seen before and anything that stops winning is dumped and dumped some more. Eventually, the level of pile on for some things and dumping others becomes a bit extreme and imo feels like we're getting there with some things if not there already. 

It does feel as if people need to expand their investment universe. Seems like if people don't want to invest in the popular things they act like there's nothing to invest in. Sooooo many people all with the same playbook - it works until it doesn't, you have to be flexible and have other ideas in mind beyond the same couple of dozen things that have been the most discussed for a while now. 

""the end of their run and future growth has been priced in to the stock price based on the p/e.""

Don't look at things entirely through the lens of p/e. I'm not saying that valuation is not important - I think it is ultimately important where you buy something and we get into these growth stock periods where people go ""valuation doesn't matter"" - it doesn't matter until it does all the sudden (see 2022) but if you over time view things with the singular focus of ""I don't want to buy something below some randomly chosen low p/e"" you're going to miss out on a lot of growth. There were a lot of people on here who wanted to short Nvidia at $200 in 2023 and then it went on to have one extraordinary quarter after another.; Some wise man once said - it's better to buy a great company at a fair price than to buy a piece of shit company at a cheap price, (or something like that); I’m going to continue to buy the Mag 7 whenever I get a chance. 

The way I do it is in smaller amounts trying to accumulate as many shares as I can throughout the year.  

If you dump a large sum into one of them at one time , I can see the worry about what price you got it at etc.  even though this is sometimes the best move , if your still on the sidelines waiting for valuation , just buy smaller amounts and keep adding to it; Teslas valuation is not tied to the business. It is because Elon bought a president.; I do think it is key to recognize future growth potential & upcoming catalysts, which play a fundamental role in whether you've 'missed the boat' or you can still make big gains.; If u lose money, FOMO will be fixed naturally. Missing stocks out is no problem. Losing principal is big problem.; Nvda is still good buy; I missed tons of it I  find good stock on cheap hold it for long they don’t move up for 2-3 years I sell they go up like crazy; Life is always about moving forward. what has happened doesn’t change and you just need to learn from your own mistakes. 

2 tips. 

1. calculate the value of the FOMO. how much do you actually miss? most people don’t even realize they are talking about $1k, $10k, or $50k. few poeple is taking about $100k FOMO. 

in my take, neither of those numbers change any one’s life, so FOMO is generally unecessary. not every one can pick nvda pltr at the right moment. so forget about it.

2. what is your judgement going forward? is market going 10% up for the next year? if so, invest today. near term 2% drop is less than 10%. 

JUST DO IT is the best way in the market. 80% chance you are getting an up year..; Stop looking at what you missed and look at whats coming.; Things Tesla has that other car makers don't. Energy storage, ev charging stations, AI division, robot division, self driving ""robo taxis"", the best engineers, they hire less than 1% of the applicants that apply, they build cars 1/3 the time of the closest competition, they don't just assemble cars, they build most the components in house(glass,seats,chips),lithium refining opening up in Corpus Christi Texas, over the air software updates, 20+ billion in cash, very little debt.....; Let me know when you figure it out; Your assessment is pretty good, and your concerns justified.  You should expand your list of stocks to look at to include ones with higher upside potential, like 20x rather than the very top of the market.  I agree with one of the commenters about needing a story arc.  Munger would call these mental models.  I really like RDDT itself as an example.  Social media, just shifting into profit with great growth, it could be a $1200 stock in a few years for a 12x gain.  Look for those, the biggest ones will either grow slowly or correct.; When you make an investment decision, you should have a thesis. That thesis should be - I think stock X is undervalued because \*reasons\* (alternatively, stock X is overvalued because \*reasons\*). 

When your thesis no longer makes sense you should enact your exit strategy. I was very familiar with PLTR, and felt that it was undervalued at $16, so bought in. By the time it hit $65 I decided to exit. My thesis was no longer defendable. I have since missed out on an additional 25% gain. But as they say, no one ever went broke from taking profits. 

The inverse is that I continue to hold NVDA as my thesis is still viable. I'm still up as I've been holding for some time, but the recent depression in price has eaten into those gains. Same goes for MSTF - bought in in 2019 - with a thesis predicated on Azure growth. I still feel that there is value to be had, although, expectedly growth has slowed. 

TL;DR - you shouldnt be chasing the 'run', sure you can hit big, but you can also lose your shirt. Focus on fundamentals.; There is no reliable way to tell. In the 2000s Nasdaq PE ratio peaked above 200. Before the late nineties for the S&P PE of 20 was a practically impenetrable resistance. Post 2000s the median PE of the S&P permanently increased and now PE of 20 is closer to a support and rarely dips below it. Probably due to the first great democratisation of investing from internet brokerages. People make a lot of noise about the PE currently above or approaching the previously established ceiling but there is no guarantee that there isnt going to be a second democratisation of investing through min fee apps. Anyone who claims they can tell you exactly when a bull run will end well in advance is full of shit. Even the best traders who are highly attuned to indicators would probably only be able to tell on the day itself.; P/e is an awful metric for growth stocks. It’s trailing, and you really want forward looking p/e instead. Analyst estimates and targets can also be helpful for growth stocks. In the end, guessing the future is very hard.; Instead of FOMO ""coulda, shoulda, woulda"" you should do a DD and evaluate business potential. Otherwise you're just gambling.; Tesla was"" overvalued"" every year it's been in the stock market. People have always said I missed the run-up. You can't value Tesla like a car maker for several reasons. If you don't know those reasons then you haven't done enough research to invest in them. You own and use apple products everyday, yet you don't know about their valuation? They will make money off you and your data for the next 50 years bc apple lovers refuse to ever switch. Apples brand loyalty has its owners locked up. Apple owns its own appstore and every app in its store pays 15-30% just to be on its shelves... Apple has 200 billion in cash waiting for an opportunity to make a new product.; Nvidia is still dirt cheap. There I said it.; Everybody has a crystal ball, but only some of them are working, and you only know in hindsight. 

The idea of fundamental analysis is out of the window for the big hitters. Sentiment trading of bills rules. Eventually, there will be a correction, but nobody knows when and how much.

So what helps? Either you get an edge in understanding a business the way the rest cannot, you trust the magic of the index dca or you rely on your guts. DCF won't get you far with NVDA or TSLA.; just buy bitcoin it's on sale right now!; Buy stocks that are reasonably valued and be patient. Nobody can predict how long multiples will expand, so don’t even try. Avoid overvalued stocks like AAPL and TSLA. Simple as that.; I can see apple becoming the first $10T company so therefor I'm in, also their new AirPods are crazy good; everytime i buy i set target price. smths when i miss bull run and see that my target price is very close, i usually dont even invest. biggest bull run this year for me was alaska airlines where i missed round 50 percent gains, my portfolio this year is 5 percent down. it was -30 last week btw, i had great week no lie, but still need 5 percent to even out. obv lost time, but got exp as well; Every stock price represents an average opinion of what the company is going to earn in profits in the near future.  If you're a stock picker you have to decide which stocks you think are underestimated by the average opinion. There are bull and bear cases for every stock. Even stocks that are grossly overvalued on paper could be underestimated by the market and continue returning more than what investors expect. That's why very few people consistently beat the market average. Your guess is as good as anyone's.; FOMO 

There is always another trade, another company, another play.

Trying to capture a move up when a stock is at or near all time highs gives you less EV than looking for a better opportunity.; Check out ASTS, it’s in my opinion a very solid choice if you don’t mind waiting a few years potentially.; If it’s running, you’ve missed it.; You won’t participate it the 30 to 50 percent decline, so stay out til then; Your issue was that you tried to value these stocks but it’s difficult to do and even if you were spot on it’s about sentiment a stock can remain over valued for years if the big boys like it then valuation goes out the window they will keep it prompt up; Ditto OP. I’m in the same swamp, lacking the aptitude to do any fundamental or technical analysis. Core positions like Mag 7 and other large cap growth stocks and etfs are holds, come hell or high water. The smaller allocations I chip away at, taking profits if there are profits a little at a time. I don’t keep the losers for a very long time, although that has bitten me in the ass a few times as a couple rose after I dumped them.; I watched QSI go up 69% yesterday, now it’s up another 69% today. It’s insane. I sat on my hands, no FOMO for me.

That’s just on shares. I made 65% and 77% return on two sets of call contracts I had this month. To make those gains on just shares in short time…unreal.; My portfolio nvda, brk, avgo and msft.
got in early on nvda and late on the rest. Plan to ride the tide for the next 5 years, then I retire and then rethink income stocks. Is that viable?; There are other fish in the sea.; name me a time that Tesla didn't look over priced lol......many a hedge fund has gone belly up trying to predict Tesla was over priced.; Tesla has an edge when it comes to costs. I think they have a significant fire risk and I could see regulation in regards to their current models because any fire will need 100 gallons of water to put out. That is a huge problem and is a valid excuse to regulate them.; Where can you find a table of US stocks to easily compare them in one UI? By this I mean somewhere to rank the by stock price percentage change in for example daily change, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly,  three years etc.; RSI and VIX are great indicators of  a stock or market being overbought. P/E is a good indicator for long term investments; I DCA based on VIX. I buy sp500 everytime VIX hits over 20, ideally over 25.; We have a client that made 5 million of NVDA with a 9k investment! crazy, it took a while and lots of patience not to sell, but still. The next NVDA is already here and under a dollar. Good luck finding it!; Buy apple and nvida. Don’t buy tesla.; You just have to make an educated guess. How has the stock performed in previous years/months leading to this one? How is the overall market faring at the moment? What news or rumor is effecting its current price?

Individuals report tax around that too, so they need to cash out to pay tax.; Thnx , so I also invest ( dca ) in the normal vanguard and some sectoral index funds like SMH, should I also plan to buy the mag 7 along with some more risky stocks like AMD; I came here to discuss stocks not politics. 

But - I remember in the 80s and 90s when the Democrat party was synonymous with the working man and actually trying to help Americans. My mom voted for Bill Clinton. 

Now it's just a party of pro-abortion, and social identity programs, gender politics, race baiting bullshit and of course - pro sending money all over the world to pay for proxy wars and that hasn't done shit to help the working man in four+ years. 

I was certainly ready for a change.; Who's the CEO of Tesla?

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Going to be super exciting /s; So certain QC companies that do less than 20 mil yearly revenue now have 4.5 bil market caps. QC is truly this year’s meme trade.; Insert simpsons stop stop hes already dead meme; Tis nothing but a scratch.; yucky; Already had a small position but I'm adding to my Tesla short here. Chinese EVs eat Tesla's lunch internationally, they are rocking an absurd triple digit PE, and now he has alienated both sides of the political spectrum. All I need now is for trump to come out and slam Elon for wanting to increase H1Bs. Probably wishful thinking, but it would be an absolute homerun.

Plus it's just a nice hedge for a net long portfolio on rocky days like today.; Jeez Louis didn’t know Santa was bringing diddy with him 😞; I mentioned ARIS yesterday, and came across a podcast about waste water in the Permian, found [here](https://open.spotify.com/episode/11octITUh1HhRCdaKzQf8x?si=Js9Ekn9bSty1lpzEIxtTaA). 

The amount of water moved to facilitate fracking in the Permian is mind boggling. It has resulted in changing the elevation of the land land by +/-6"" in places, and the pressure with which it's injected is causing earthquakes and even geysers.; RIP to the guy that was asking about DCA vs Lump sum and lumped sum ytd; the swings these month have been bonkers; I DCA’d yesterday. My bad guys.; More like the Krampus Slump, amirite?; More than 14 million options expire on BTC today; Its crazy to me that only 35% of QQQ names are above their 50 day moving average but the index is just a hair below its all time high. Really shows just how lopsided this market is and is only 25% for the sp500; What's going on with TLT?

I have 8 stocks doing less than s&p500 but that one has been the worst so far; [Looks like S&P 600 (small caps) earnings growth](https://i.imgur.com/ti39qm4.jpeg) is finally turning positive. They were -19% and -7% realized for 2023/2024, and now 21% and 19% for the next two years. 

The same source (Yardeni) says the same figures for the S&P 500 are 14% and 14%, and for mid caps (S&P 400), 14% and 16%.  For context, forward P/Es are 22, 16, and 16 for large, mid, small in that order. So mids offer same earnings growth as large for 63% of the multiple. Smalls give you 1.5x higher earnings growth as mids for same multiple. And smalls give you 1.5x earnings growth for 63% of multiple of large.

[The steady rise in the S&P 600 forward P/E the last few years](https://i.imgur.com/96AuYYd.jpeg) was driven in part by earnings decline while price stayed mostly constant. Now earnings will start to kick in and suppress P/E.

Unlike the Russell 2K, to be included in the S&P 600, ""Companies must have positive as-reported earnings over the most recent quarter, as well as over the most recent four quarters (summed together)"". Though funnily enough, the 5 year return for the R2K is very similar to the S&P 600, showing market really dgaf about profitability, given that 1/3 of R2K companies are unprofitable.; The economy is so bad that streets and malls and stores continue to be packed with cars, gotta love the perpetual victims!; Getting a little nervous about this bird flu; i guess we're not getting the santa rally huh.

Edit: 2021, 2017, 2014, 2010, 2007.

I'd love to see the current stock price and my open p/l. Not terribly concerned about today's performance.; SPX reversal; VIX being tamed.; 5800 2025 then up from there late cycle coming up kids.; Good volume today.; [removed]; I’ll get yelled at for spamming by some, but unusual drop this morning. However it’s only allowed to sell for an hour or so and now we have begun the great V. Hope no one took the bait. Never can stay down and always on its way back up. I don’t see how anyone could panic. Like it has a chance of going lower after 10:30.; Anyone else believe we live in a false vacuum?; Just sold my first call on S&P-500 🥳. It's sort of ""covered"" because a lot of my ETFs are highly correlated to it.

Vix is benign at 15.50.. so got a cool one week's groceries worth premium, on 8% OTM, expiring in Jan.

Am I stupid? Will I starve in February?


What's considered a good ""income"" on 8% OTM, with a month long expiry? To me, it sounds like a good deal, because 8% upside in a month is bit too much, without any major event in sight.; I was already exhausted. This is going to be extremely detrimental to my mental health.; 2021 was crypto 

2022 was energy 

2023 was Muh AI 

2024 was some Muh AI and then now QC 

2025 will be fun; While the OG quantum sweatshop, google, trades with the worst PE of mag7; People are using market as ATM.. cash for the NYE party ; it's a SALE 🛒; Rotation baby!  :D; Agree 100%.

They are moving northwards now.; The conditional probability of lump sum outperforming DCA given record high valuations and speculative fervor is a lot lower than the 2/3 value everyone keeps repeating.; I last lump summed 40K on Jan3 2022.  Won't ever make that mistake again!  Never lump sum when at ATH; 😅; We will keep telling him 2/3 is bigger than 1/3 😂; The studies are biased he said  😂; Me too. I lump sum yesterday; I did at the start of today. . Also my fault. ; Where does one trade BTC options?; Adding to that, a lot of the 35% are bloated or overvalued companies like pltr, Tesla, etc; Shows how lopsided….and how it isn’t really just “a market.”   It’s Top 20.  And then hundreds of other companies that had an average to mediocre year; wall street bros say that is perfectly fine. The best companies make most of the money and are weighted the most; Bonds react negatively to inflation. Lowering rates cause inflation. The feds cut rates when they think the economy is doing bad. But that didn't really match the market in September, November and December. Upcoming administration tax cuts and tariffs should also increase inflation.


But a recession would cause tlt to increase in price as they're considered safe.


The sentiment of the market can change quickly. Bad this week. Good the next.


I do think a recession is coming but I thought that for a while lol. Market might recover.; Yeah, for real. The hell is happening?; What about Nana?; wats grandpa; Part of it might be the hostile reaction of the republican base to the H1B program.  Trump was previously much more amenable, but if he canceled the program, tech companies are going to lose a lot of talent.; It’s tax harvesting by the big boys after two 30% up years. No more reason needed than that.; Why strange? Valuations are too damn high. A stock like AAPL should have a P/E of 20 rather than 42.; Realistically, Jay Pow Wow slammed shut any hopes of passing by the JPM collar high end of 6055 and cemented that 6099 will be the top for SPX in 2024.

May have also cemented that SPX equal weight has put in an important high, but it's still too early to tell.; You mean Ukraine’s drones doing it; Bane of my existence; Failing to break ATH was hilarious to see; next year, that one is going to be 40% up, and the rest will languish at 10-15%; And yet IJR (the equivalent to the S&P 600 small caps) has been just as disappointing movement wise as the Russell 2000 since 2018 really, even with the more stringent requirements...

Let's be real, at this point, you can't count on anything positive from small caps as a group until the pundits give up on being bullish here and probably until after another political side of the spectrum gets to be disappointed on how small caps as a group move for them, for a decent period of time.; I’m a fan of the SP400 but the issue is that the companies are mostly midsize financials and industrials who don’t much margin power and suffer from high competition.; no joke. today is friday, and despite being a holiday week, my local mall parking lot was packed early afternoon. almost no spaces left.; Smoke screen for government corruption and deep state control. Also possible lizard people/alien invasion imminent.; It was a santra rally if you sold before big boy came.; How fair of you; Just my humble opinion, but the move post election was very disappointing outside of tech.


I wasn't around for the lead up to '17, being in my younger 20's then, but you saw the Russell 2000 and banks actually hold their gains well, and in this case, they threw most of their gains away in a few weeks after racking up solid gains.


I suppose this might actually show that the market remembers and is skeptical that Trump does anything special for the ""others"" outside of tech companies.; I have family running around trying to get people to buy in on Tesla, not for fundamental belief in the company but for fundamental belief in Musk. It's a meme stock, and it'll crash as a meme stock does. You can probably track action on the stock by how well people who have bought in feel about him; so right now he's having a fall out with MAGA rank-and-file over immigration. Those people will cash out, and I have a feeling that's a lot of people.; Predictive value doesn’t exist if there’s not a decent sample or consistent trend. Dec. 2010, 2014 and 2017 were good times to buy. Dec. 2007 and 2021 weren’t. All this potentially shows is that we can’t predict anything from a bad Santa rally.

But also, how are you defining “bad Santa Rally”? The market seems to have been doing ok lately from where I’m standing.; If I have my timing right on when the Santa Claus rally is supposed to occur, I think the fat lady is just getting prepared to warm up, not singing yet.

Thing with this is that I don't think it panned out preceding this year. If you can remember, 2024 actually started slowly, and that's what I think placed the ""Santa Claus rally period"" in the red.; Not a one of the expensive Precision laptops I unboxed this week would boot. They’re prioritizing profit over making working products so their stock will probably do very well. ; I think it will do fine.  It’s way off the highs so in that way it’s a bit price derisked.

When it comes to pcs and generic servers, if Microsoft goes through with their plans to pretend all existing computers are obsolete and force everyone to buy new hardware for windows 11 ram-through, Dell is a beneficiary.  

When it comes to data center buildouts, they are one of if not the top choice for architects and CTOs to rubber stamp since they have tried and true products, and especially, they have operations tools that are much better than everyone else.  Will CTOs want to green light big SMCI purchases when there’s still a lot of clouds over SMCI’s accounting and existence?  Or will they do the safe, job-protecting thing and just buy Dell?

Company wise they tend to have conservative guidance and stable leadership.  It’s not recommended to bet against Michael Dell.; It's a packaging company. What is exactly that they do? Buy components, assemble and sell? My teenage son does it too.; Remember they work for the Big Boys. Not us.; Yep, people are selling their winners and buying the dogs.; That's how u know it's not you, it's the market; Webull? That's what I use; Im okay w that as long as Jan 3rd is 5800 ;p; Sorry - the post you're trying to make mentions a stock that currently breaks rule #7.

Any of the following criteria is considered breaking the rule:


* Typically trades under $5 or previously traded under $5 within 6 months

* Below $300 million market cap or previously traded under 300m before the pump within 6 months

* Most OTC / PINK stocks

* Usually has missed reporting/filings; no auditing or odd auditing issues

* Low volume or wide bid/ask spread

* Doesn't have any big name institutional holders

 * If the biggest institutional holder is a stock promoter then they don't count as an institutional holder

* All SPACs

You can learn more about rule #7 here: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/pennystocks; If every day there's a V, you comment to say hey there's a V, that's not really adding much to the convo; Bro you're whining about a market being insanely bullish... To a subreddit that literally only wants insanely bullish markets. Of course you're getting awful feedback lol this isn't the place and your method of going about it is just whiny and not useful. 

Market predictability is a good thing. Get off reddit and turn those words into results. Any day trader knows that almost every red day will V so maybe trade it instead of complaining.; Just happened player; Vacuum decay theory is occurring and we are bye bye soon; That's not even close to what covered calls are; You own the S&P fund you sold the call on right?; I'm waiting for it to run back to highs and double top.  Ill be taking a 6m Put position on it and sleeping REAL easy; It’s like “Yayyyy Santa’s here!!” We rally until we find out he brought diddy…no one wanted to be diddled on Christmas; Happened to me winter of '22. Was upside down for awhile even while adding to the position. Won't ever do it again even if it's statistically wrong. This summer I moved an old 401k and decided to dca the whole year. It's cost me but idc. I didn't want to top a new high and I really thought the market was frothy. Oh well in the long run it doesn't amount to much.; I'll never lump sum again regardless of where the market's at. I bought 23k worth of HSY for about 230 per share and we had a nice move up to 275, so I didn't buy the top. But now with the price down to 170 I really wish I would've DCA'd that.; you just caught a bad year:

Vanguard Study 2012:
Lump sum investing outperformed DCA about 66% of the time across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, and a 60/40 portfolio).
The study simulated data from the U.S., U.K., and Australia over 10-year periods, concluding that the earlier you invest, the more time the money has to grow.
Average outperformance: LSI yielded 1.95% higher returns than DCA over 12-month periods.

Morningstar study 2022:
Over a 10-year period, lump sum investing beat DCA 68% of the time.
However, DCA reduced downside risk by about 25% during bear markets, making it a more appealing option for risk-averse investors.; Thankfully you can now buy TOPT and just buy the top 20 in a neat etf; Without a doubt in mind a recession is coming but no one knows the timing. You can lose a lot of money trying to time it lol; Among other things, market not liking the move in rates.; The 10 year has spiked up these past 3 months, it's up 22%.

That means the smart money is betting inflation will go up under the new administration, or for whatever reason rotating into treasuries. This brings down market returns.; Bro, they harvest loss, not profits. I'm lucky to be resident of country that has no concept of capital gains tax. So help me understand this... 

You earn, pay tax, and hopefully save and invest this already taxed money. Then you hopefully get a bit of profit.. and that too is taxed? 🤯

So, what if I had bought AMZN 10 years ago, and made 10X? I'm now paying tax on my 9X profit, for something I held for 10 years? What about inflation over these 10 years (indexation benefit)?; Russel 2k is basically flat since 2018 accounting for inflation while the indices have doubled. 

Add in a correction/due recession and we could see Russell flat for another 3+years. 

10 years of flat Russell. 

Has there been a time in history where this has happened?; O is a dumpster fire their main client is wall greens and General Mills 

I don’t think they are good; Lol; Think S&P 600 is more compelling than S&P 400. You're getting the 37% discount  to large caps that mid caps also have but better earnings growth. On 2 a year forward basis, seems like small caps > mid caps. 

A recessionary environment throws all of these estimates out the window of course and safety is in the large caps (+ arguably international given that they have been in quasi recession for several years and are already dirt cheap).; I transferred my 401k from stocks into money market fund on christmas eve.  Only because i'm getting ready to roll it over to my IRA in January and they don't do in kind transfers.; He has no way of doing anything special; He shat on Green Environmentalists 

They kept buying his shitcans

Now he shits on the Republican base and tells them he wants to replace their jobs with low-pay foreigners 

They’ll keep not buying his shitcans 

Means nothing except for dumb retail investors who somehow actually think a short term stock price reflects the value of a company.; 2011 was a down year 

2015 was a down year

2018 was a down year; The Santa Rally begins today officially 

You could argue it includes Christmas Eve also. The official definition in Dec 26- January 5th.; What was wrong with them; This reddit will fail English language comprehension test. 'Sort of' and the quotes around ""covered"" should tell people that I'm in no way implying a ""covered call"" @u/coveredcallnomad100; No, it's a balanced fund, and another I have is SOXX (so heavy oj NVDA). It's correlated, but not 1:1 the index.


It's my first time selling a call. I think, I got a good ""income"", with 6500 strike (8% out), Jan expiry.. almost free money 🤑 


Should I have expected more premium? Did I get short-changed?; That's past week's news, though. I've been seeing green for several days in a row since then; It's still very unclear though that we've actually flipped back to 2022 esque performance. 

If we have, then the wrong things have been outperforming...; Yes and eventually they’ll find a way to tax me for posting on reddit; Trump can do a lot. Tax cuts, deregulation, less aggressive on antitrust, pro M&A, reducing capital requirements on banks (helps banks and small/medium sized companies), etc. But he can also hurt the market via tariffs, immigration, foreign policy, and his overall dysfunctional nature. We saw it during his first term. Market would run following a policy change and then selloff following a crazy Tweet he made in the middle of the night.; Environmentalists weren't buying Teslas. It was always clout chasing tech bros, and on some level it was always tied to Elon's personality. Environmentalists put emphasis on public transportation as a first order, and if they're buying electric vehicles, then it's one of the other models from Ford or Chevrolet that are cheaper.

Tesla's main conceit was that it was cool to have an electric car now because it looks like a sports car and not a Prius. Environmentalists don't care about sports cars, lol.

Tesla will always have a built in fan base of Elon Musk cultists. They'll keep buying his garbage cars and cybertrucks, even when they brick or run over someone on auto mode. But that's not going to be enough to sustain demand, especially when the company keeps missing delivery targets. And then having to troubleshoot their poor quality cars. Tesla's brand is Elon's personality, and when he starts alienating the people who like him for his personality and the dumb shit he says, then the stock will crash.; 2011 and 2015 Nasdaq was up 3% and 8%. S&P500 basically flat both years. 2018 was overall a down year but I think most people buying at Christmas 2017 would have done quite well overall. There was a big rally for most of 2018 and a big sell off at the end of the year followed by a quick recover at the start of 2019. But ok, overall the performance these years is lower than those around it. The question remains though, how did you define a bad Santa rally. This seems a little like trying to crowbar something into a pattern.; I get what u sayin; Yeah sure; Just clarifying you didn’t sell a covered call. You sold a naked call, and should the price jump and you have to deliver you’ll have to buy those shares at market value. May not matter to you since it sounds like other holdings will rise, but thought that was worth pointing out.; > It's still very unclear though that we've actually flipped back to 2022 esque performance.

Nowhere in my post does it say anything about 2022.; You might be splitting hairs a little too thin here.  Left leaning climate conscious people were his whole market.; you mean, I can't just hold it out till expiry? 6500 level seems very unlikely to me, in a month.. unless Trump says, US of A is going zero tax.; Sigh, I guess I'm going to have to spell this out in clear English.

For the market to be reacting as if inflation is a concern, tech stocks really should be selling off hard on the US10Y spiking.

Left-leaning climate conscious people were already getting into the Prius, the Spark, and other EVs that were already on the market before Tesla's Model S was released. The Roadster and Model S were created for a higher end market that wanted to: a.) buy into Elon's personal brand (techbros, etc.) and b.) people who had money and wanted an electric car that looked either sporty or conventional.

My Portfolio & Strategy (Check it out),"**Note:** I'm just about to start my stocks journey. Thinking of buying this portfolio I have written down today/tmr.

**Strategy:**

For the $147 divide it into 4 payments or however many stocks I have. The one that is the cheapest and the most declining i put the biggest payment into it. 

contributing $210 into stock market each month.   
\* Ex 55 (Most Declining price) + 45 + 30 + 15 (most Increasing price) = 145.   
\* 55+ 45 +30+15

**Large cap stocks (70%) -Initial $1330 :  Contribute extra $147 Each Month** 

* Apple - 259 x 1
* MRVL - 115 x 2 230
* Amazon - 225x 1
* Meta 600 x 1

**Small Cap Stocks (30%) - Initial $570 : Contribute extra $63 Each Month**

* SP Funds S&P 500 Sharia Industry Exclusions ETF - 43 x 13.2 = 570 
   * I know This isn't as good as Voo/VTI, but I prefer a sharia/halal ETF, this actually does good too.

QUESTION: For my large cap stocks, I'm thinking of buying 2 shares of everything, or just keeping it the way it is. Only saying this because I feel like the market will be crashing soon. I'll buy more at a lower price if I keep it the way I have it right now. I'm also putting $210 in monthly total, so I think I'm good, or will prices rise more and I'll miss out on this discount?

Thoughts on AST Space Mobil (ASTS),"I’ve been looking into this company. It has an interesting mission, and I want to like it, but I’m having a difficult time seeing a successful business plan.

To their credit (and the only reason why I’m considering them) they do have A LOT of contracts with major carriers. That said, the contracts don’t really appear to be worth all that much, especially considering the insane costs that comes with space missions. For instance, their contract with one of the largest carriers, Verizon, is only worth $100M, which will only fund the creation and launch of a few satellites. AST still needs to put 60+ satellites into orbit before they can even think of offering 24/7 satellite internet services. That’s not cheap. They have an insane amount of debt, and their contracts seem comparatively cheap (which might be the only reason they have all these telcos signing with them).

Combine that with the fact that Starlink is going to be their major competitor, and they have name recognition and actually already have enough satellites in orbit to actually offer D2C internet services. Starlink hasn’t been seriously trying to capture the cell phone market, but if they start putting an ounce of effort into it, I don’t see a reason why any telco will go with AST over Starlink.

I want to like this company, though. Am I missing anything?

Even then, their texting service is kinda shit at the moment (look up the restrictions for texting via starlink in New Zealand.)

Meanwhile, ASTS alpha tedting shows seamless voice and video communication, and the full constellation will be able to compete with 5G.

RE: funding, they've already covered the cost of the first 26 satellites. The plan isn't to be a standalone carrier, but rather to be an addon to existing carrier plans. The current sentiment is that the MNOs will simply include a fee on user's bills, and a portion of that fee will be paid to ASTS.

Just using conservative numbers...

In the US alone, Verizon and AT&T combine for ~260M subscribers. If they add a $2 / line charge to user's bills, that's $520M /mo. The carriers don't really have to do anything to gain this coverage, so we can assume 50% for ASTS. This works out to $260M per month / $3.12B per year of revenue.

Vodaphone has 330M subscribers. Plans are cheaper in EU and Africa, so let's cut the revenue by 75%. This is an additional $990M / year.

Between just these two, ASTS is looking at ~$4B / year in revenue.

ASTS is estimating a total cost of $1.8B to build out and launch their full constellation of 168 satellites. After that, maintenance on the ground is negligible. People are estimating ASTS will be over 80% profitable once they're in full service. This is earning of $3.2B per year.

Edit: adding on to this, ASTS current public float is 149,320,000. At earnings of $3.2B, that works out to an EPS of $21.43.

If we assume a conservative P/E ratio of 20, that works out to a share price of roughly $430; Good investment. I expect to see a decent return 2026-2027.; Starlink can bring service to cell phones if the FCC majorly decreases regulations. ASTS can bring 5G to pre-existing cell phones once they launch more satellites. They can do it with far less satellites than Starlink. Their tech is better and they have patents. 

However... The FCC is only in America. ASTS is poised to be successful with their superior tech everywhere on Earth.; Bought mine about 6 months ago. Added to my position quite a few times. They are competing for market share just like GSAT. Both are good buys

“Buy it and forget it”; Don’t force yourself to like a company .; My biggest holding. 10k shares at 5$ average. 

You really should do some more research . ASTS subreddit. Kook, anpanman, catse on Twitter.

You're thesis on starlink being a direct competitor isn't way off...but they lack their sats aren't equipped for D2C voice and video without some serious regulation changes,  which they won't get. And if you think for a second Verizon, att, Vodafone,  Rakuten ( the list goes on ) would ditch asts for starlink...I just don't see it happening.

It was 100% a long term hold. The threat of more dilution does loom, but grows less and less likely by the day. Their block 1 sats are working/testing right now. I would expect a positive update in the earnings report. Block 2 scheduled for Q1. Once block 1 is up and running they will.be generating revenue, to take some of the worry of further dilution away...

If you are looking at opening a position now, we seem to be in a holding pattern between 22 and 27ish. DCA might be the wise choice...but as we've seen before, news can come at any time...; Your DD appears to be extremely cursory. You’d do yourself a world of good if you deep dive into the ASTSpacemobile subreddit where you’ll find some crazy levels of analysis from RF engineers and investors. This company has the potential to have the biggest subscription service of any company in history. They have first mover advantage, they have patents, they have over 40 agreements with MNOs worldwide, with which comes huge lobbying power (not that they need it, whereas Starlink does). 

Yes they don’t have the funds at the moment to build out the entire constellation but they don’t need to. Government contracts and Exlm loans are both in the pipeline, and they have almost enough to build out the first 25 satellites, which will bring them to cashflow positive.

Don’t forget, the contracts you refer to are only pre-payments. Vodafone have 500 mil subscribers worldwide. Even if you assume a 10% uptake rate (50 mil) of the service from Vodafone alone at a conservative price of $2 per month (and ASTS take a 50% cut), ASTS would be taking in $50 mil PER MONTH from Vodafone alone. In other words, that 100 mil prepayment would be enough to cover just two months of service even at very conservative estimates. The money tree has only just started to grow. This company will have the biggest subscription service of any company in history. $500-$1,000 stock by 2030.

Edit: Starlink is not serious competition. Their satellites are not big enough, not to mention they have other tech limitations. At most they will only be able to do phone calls and texts, unreliably.; It's a Reddit darling and there are 100's of threads on ASTS. They have the best satellite technology but Starlink is hot on their heels. Starlink has more satellites in orbit today, with the SpaceX ability to launch on demand. There is room for multiple players in this space, and it's good for consumers to have options.; 24/7 internet service will cover the globe and be the standard for internet in the near future.

Everyone will want to adopt it, there will be no more dead zones or zones without reach (Unless your underground).

All Major telecommunication companies are partnering with ASTS. They have the superior broadband and technology.

Starlink has 6,700 satellites, ASTS can perform better service with 1/30 of those numbers.


Anyone in the globe who has a smartphone can access the internet  now once the satellites are in the air.

ASTS will 20x from the current price, potentially more.; One of my biggest long term holdings. ; I belive 2025 is going to be a good year for ASTS; I bought some like 5 years ago and forgot about it.; The stock has a cult like following, so you are getting very biased answers from those who want it to succeed. I will probably get downvoted to oblivion for this. 

Both ASTS and Starlink provide a certain amount of bandwidth to a fixed area via their sats. Right now Starlink can do 10 Mbps total on that beam, which DOES allow for phone/video streaming technically but in practice that beam would cover hundreds of users and therefore only support texts by each person. As SpaceX continues to increase sats in orbit, they will have more and more beams which means they can give each person more individual bandwidth. 

ASTS can do more output per satellite, but their sats are much more complex and expensive. They can launch about 5 satellites at a time vs Starlink doing ~20. Also keep in mind launch costs - ASTS is paying ~3 times more per launch vs Starlink since SpaceX is vertically integrated. 

Also ASTS claims first mover advantage, but they seem to have lost that as SpaceX has now fully deployed their first orbital shell and has worldwide coverage. Meanwhile ASTS is still waiting on a permit from the FCC for about 9 months now!

The way ASTS doesn't even know how they'll make revenue or how much is concerning, assuming the phone company tacks on a blanket fee to EVERY subscriber and pay ASTS regardless if they use the service seems like very wishful thinking. 

Long story short - ASTS has good tech in a big emerging market, but I don't think they can compete against vertically integrated SpaceX with reusable rockets.; Personally I think the company may be a success, but there are a lot of current headwinds and space comms has historically been more of a company breaker than company maker. I'm old enough to remember Iridium, Starlink really benefitted from being second mover in that sense, they saw the mistakes Motorola made in their $5B bet. 

It looks like they have some good contracts, but there's so much capital investment required, and they have to keep doing everything right, no setbacks. I had a few shares, just kinda dipping my toe in the water, but my take is that they're so far from profitability with so much investment necessary before then, I'd rather wait and buy in when success looks a little more imminent. Made the opposite mistake with Quantumscape buying into that a couple years ago, it's finally starting to show some momentum with the testing of vehicle batteries but it just traded sideways for years. Even now, they're talking ""by 2030"" for commercial launch. When success is way out in the future, FOMO is usually a mistake, just wait for a good entry point when it'll have some positive catalysts and let the institutions carry the shares until then.; Reading this thread is hilarious. Really shows how underground the opportunity still is. People have no vision and don't bother putting in the work, sad day for you brothas. The funny thing is I first heard about this stock in r/stocks in a thread where people were listing out their favorite game changing stock tickers a few years ago.; ASTS is like when Steve Jobs pulled the iPhone out of his pocket live on stage. It will change the world and use cases not yet conceived will be birthed. Money will rain down from the sky.; I prefer LUNR; I've been in out of ASTS, had a position of 800 shares at once @ $24 this was 3 months ago I missed the run up. This is a high risk, high reward stock , burning HEAPS of cash weekly. I do want to jump back in, but I were to id play it safe, have the money sitting there saved up untill the sats are up in the sky and making revenue , Since I missed the run up id rather pay $40 a share when there successful and start making profit , rather than pay $25 a share living of hopes and hope they don't go bankrupt and they hit all their milestones; I prefer RKLB; Elon will make sure he gets every contract going forward (if he isn’t fired by March) 

So I don’t want to touch ASTS until
Musk is gone; If you can’t see ASTSs potential you have some serious goggles on. You will regret it down the road; ASTS needs several billion dollars to build its satellites, they have $500 million after diluting their shareholders few months ago. They will need to dilute continually, this is a very capital-intensive business. They will either declare bankruptcy or become one of those wannabe TV satellite companies barely limping by as T and VZ collect any minuscule revenue. They will not survive against Musk's Starlink, no matter what the cult tells you about their superior ""tech""

https://www.fierce-network.com/wireless/can-direct-cell-satellite-services-make-money; Starling isn’t partnering with telco’s, it’s their competition ; ASTS needs much more money to build their network of satellites.  That means dilution, a lot of dilution.  I'm not touching this stock.; ASTS is an easy short.; seems like a scam company.; Scam. I’d run.; OP is obviously a bear 😂 He gonna get wrecked or he’ll get out today after all the answers he recieved which he didn’t like.; You should probably use postpaid phone subscribers in your calculation.

AT&T - 72.2M; Repping the Spacemob well! You forgot the government use contracts as if 20x in six years wasn’t enough.; Looks like OP didn’t like your answer haha; There's not a shot your numbers are right in the real world.

You have no idea how up in arms their customer base would get by $2/mo.

It sounds trivial but it's not to them I work in the industry; [deleted]; I’m stacking shares to hold this one long term. Really excited to see where it goes!; The global angle is actually huge here. While everyone's focused on the FCC and US market, ASTS has partnerships across multiple continents. They don't need to wait for US regulatory green lights to start operating in other markets that are desperate for connectivity. Plus their satellite-to-phone tech is way more efficient - they can cover the same area with fewer satellites than Starlink would need. The patent moat is just icing on the cake.; So, you do know Starlink got the go-ahead back at the end of November right?

The hurricanea and the emergency approval took the fight out of most of what people had to try to really restrict them down too severely. 

So the clock is ticking for AST. It isn't superior technology, if it is a space game and the technology is still primarily on earth and the competition has theirs up and running in space.; This. 👆Like the chart, if it presents an opportunity. Not the company.; I've been aware of ASTS since 2020s lol. I regret not getting the cheap warrants at the time. The thing that put me off was the funding. I just couldn't see a guarantee for the launching and deployment of so many satellites without a big backer of sorts. Is there a clear path to future funding now?; How do they launch their satellites ?; I’m completely ignorant on this so forgive me! I thought starlink offered broadband speeds for home use.  What am i missing here?
Edit. Different tech to communicate with phones not on most older starlink sats.; This is the problem, it is their to lose. By 2030, it could very well be a ""hey, what ever happened to Nokia"". But instead of Nokia, it is AST.; Every stock has a cult following because investors doesnt want to lose their money and egos; You make all very fantastic points. This is one of those thread where I think people need to look at the logic. Look at the up and down votes, and double check it against the news. 

>The stock has a cult like following, so you are getting very biased answers from those who want it to succeed. I will probably get downvoted to oblivion for this. 

I am getting the downvote. So hopefully they leave you alone. I got hate for pointing out Starlight got FCC approval. (It's public record, tons of news stories). 

I get wanting it to be successful, but I also strongly believe if you are going to invest in technology you should understand what it is for and what the competition is, because it can change very quickly. 

>Also ASTS claims first mover advantage, but they seem to have lost that as SpaceX has now fully deployed their first orbital shell and has worldwide coverage. Meanwhile ASTS is still waiting on a permit from the FCC for about 9 months now!

They did, for quite some time. The same was true for Boeing, who was another one sitting at the top and who has fallen. ASTS is at risk of that. Contracts are only good if there is actually service to provide.  I have one of the companies ""signed up for service"" with ASTS. It is not an option to get, so they are not delivering. 

But realistically, if they can't deliver or if he gets an upgraded network, they lost when it was completely theirs to win. That is exactly the thing, stock research absolutely needs to look at who is the power hungry company nipping at the heels, that will take someone down given the chance. 

None of them have been able to explain how ASTS is going to get back ahead from falling behind.; This is wrong on so many levels. remindMe! 5 years.; You really do give good advice!; ASTS didn't go to the trouble of making those giant satellites just so they can be expensive to manufacture. The larger the satellite, the more performance you can get from it, and it cannot be compensated by number of sats, as the cells cannot overlap.; Its alright we'll help them funding their growth the way investing was meant to be and you can jump in when other will have done it for you. 

Youre welcome; I'm going to be a multi millionaire in 5 years and people in this thread will still be chasing, wondering where the next amazon is; Apples and oranges.; Why not both?; You will pay $100 or $200 a share when the satellites start making profit. ; I'd do both, and that's my plan. I have a portion I've bought already that I'm profitable on, but it's as much as I wanted to put into a riskier play at this moment. As they keep succeeding and lowering the risk I'll add more at the higher price. My average will go up, but with the risk going down then the massive upside will be more likely.; Not similar at all; I prefer hood ..  ffs

/s; They COMPLEMENT each other. RKLB - even when their satellite constellation is launched - won't compete with ASTS as there's no change RKLB go for a D2C constellation. It's too crowded already. So buy RKLB for the Launch, Space Systems, and future constellation and add ASTS for the D2C global leading service. Combined you have two of the biggest opportunities locked up.; they have enough capital to launch their initial sats. they have just a small shortfall of the cash needed to launch enough to get to a self funding position.; Starlink has T-Mobile. My understanding is most of Starlink’s current satellites simply don’t have the right antennas that will work with mobile phones, but their new satellites do. They previously weren’t really trying to get into the satellite internet to cell phones market, which is why AST managed to beat them to getting a bunch of contracts. But if that changes, I don’t really see anyone going with AST. They don’t even have enough satellites in orbit to offer what they’re saying they want to; They have enough funds to build out their constellation to 25 sats. Management guided that they will be fully cash flow neutral at this point & will be able to sustain the cost of building out further satellites from the revenue of the 25.; I think they've got enough funds to carry them into profit; How do you figure? Have you inside info? Hundreds of telecom experts have looked over their business plan and did their due diligence before signing hundreds of millions in contracts, so for now I'm going to lean with their research as to the potential of this.; Nah, I was actually curious what everyone’s thoughts were. I put a few hundred dollars in as a gamble. We’ll see what happens; ASTS is capable of full data transmission, not just voice. All those devices would be included...; There is also the FirstNet contract for first responders. I've talked to some forest service firefighters that didn't know about ASTS and were very excited about the possibilities. They said they currently haul out a mobile cell tower out close to the fire and reception is spotty depending on the line of sight. ASTS would eliminate the need to drive a cell tower up a mountain.; Even reducing those numbers 10x it still is a much higher share price than it is right now. But then add on the other 30+ telcos that have agreements with ASTS. 

People may pay a premium to have no dead zones with voice and data, or it could be an optional add-on, either way there are a lot of potential customers all over the world that deal with large dead zones. Lots of rural areas that people live in and drive through. 

My cell phone company contract just raised their prices $5 a month, and other carriers have done that recently too. A few bucks for better service coverage will be absorbed the same way all inflation does,  grumbling, and making cuts to purchases. At least this would be adding a needed service for hundreds of millions of people around the world.; It's worth running different numbers to see the outcome if we're doing a true DD.

Let's use the reduced subscriber numbers from a previous post, because I think that's valid...

>VZ + ATT go from 260M to 140M subs. If we assume the same ratio for Vodofone, it goes from 330M to 220M.

At those subscriber levels and $2 / mo to the subscriber, it works out to earnings of $1.8B / year.

If we reduce that cost to $1 / mo, we're still at $900M / yr earnings, or $6.03 EPS. At $6.03 EPS & P/E = 20, that's a share price of $120.60, or a little under 5x where we are now.

If we go even further, and reduce margin from the estimated 80% to 50%, all the math works out to $74 per share.

We're still ignoring the other 37 MNOs that have already signed agreements with AST, as well as government use (the SDA has selected AST as a prime contractor in the HALO program).

I think no matter how you slice it, the current range of $22-$26 is very undervalued.; Even if $2 is too high and they end up on a smaller number, he's only considered those three MNOs so far, there's plenty more like Rakuten (promising ASTS coverage in 2026) and even the military has use cases.

That number is achievable if they can execute.; This is an open discussion. If you want to share your thesis with the rest of the class, we're all interested in reading it. There's been a great discussion below where we've changed the numbers of users, $$ per month, profit margins, etc..., I'm certainly not ready to die on any hill, so if you have a reasonable argument, feel free to make it; The EU is a lot less prone to bribing regulators as well, so even if Starlink gets to pollute the spectrum in the US, there is no chance they get EU approval. There is no software replacement for antenna size, and even Starship & bigger Starlink sats won't change the equation for ASTS. Starlink's main advantage is mass producing cheap satellites, but ASTS has been able to keep production costs low considering the engineering complexity of their sats.; From what I understand, ASTS can provide 5G, Starlink only can provide emergency calls and texts.; This is nonsense if you're a position trader (which you need to be if you're even looking at ASTS). Sure, you need to like the chart if you're planning on jumping in and out in a half hour and scalping 2%, but if you want to be an investor instead of a trader, you really need to know the company you're investing with.; Its about a year of rocky waters for their finances

End of 25 and they will be providing service to Japan via Rakuten and likely other island type nations

My guess is that the worst risk is not on funding but satellites blowing up or failing to arrive to orbits as expected. That would set them back by months; The ones so far where spacex but I believe they have a contract with bezos thing, bluebird or whatever it’s called; That service requires a receiver type box installed in the home. The service being discussed in this post is direct to cellular service with unmodified phones.; Home use broadcast requires a large dish on the surface. People aren't carrying an satellite dish around with them in their pocket. 

ASTS simply works as is with phones already made, but they are not a replacement for a dedicated internet cable line.; Ya except it’s high tech satellites in space, kind of a higher barrier to entry.; By the same token, the new standard we all get used to is having cell service literally everywhere thanks to satellites and we consider it antiquated that there were ever black spots. AST is way ahead in providing it; The Starlink FCC approval was for texting only. There is a waiver request from Starlink in the courts right now, because in order for them to provide voice, they need to significantly interfere with ground based telecom. They got an emergency waiver during Helene because there was no ground based telecom, but there is zero evidence that the FCC is planning on loosening regulations on a permanent basis. Meanwhile, AST's technology (patent protected) somehow threads the needle and doesn't interfere with ground based communication. Both AT&T and Verizon have dumped a lot of money into AST, and if the FCC somehow decides to grant Starlink's waiver, they'll be going to war to protect their investment.

Starlink has a car, while AST has a scooter. AST is saying ""we can easily operate a delivery service in Time Square, exactly as it all is right now"", while Starlink is saying ""we can operate a delivery service in Times Square, but you need to let us run over a bunch of people while we do it. Can we get a waiver? ""; How is ASTS falling behind? They have less satellites up since starlink has been doing this for longer, but their SATs are completely different. Starlinks current satellites cannot deliver what ASTS can, and to truly compete they'd have to launch a whole new fleet, which involves designing new satellites. So Starlink are the ones who are falling behind.

If ASTS can't deliver what they promised or have major setbacks then they absolutely could lose their tech advantage. 

It's a gamble stock, but ever successful launch and test makes it less of a gamble, and since no one else can deliver the same service they still have the advantage. And with 45+ telecom services around the world signed up with them, once they get their fleet running they'll have a massive market. 

If you want safe companies to invest in that deliver consistent returns then there are plenty of those out there. If you want to try to get in early on a company that could 10x then that's a lot harder to find.; I will be messaging you in 5 years on [**2029-12-27 07:21:34 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2029-12-27%2007:21:34%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hn1cm0/thoughts_on_ast_space_mobil_asts/m401yvz/?context=3)

|-|-|-|-|; How can't it be compensated by number of sats? Big satellite just means it can do more concurrent beams, you can easily adjust for that with more smaller sats that cover those same size cells - it just takes more sats; There's a reason that private and public capital have historically been separate things. If you're managing a $600B portfolio, you have the luxury of taking on different degrees of risk, even those with a 10+ year pay out. For an investor not able to shape the market, not everything makes sense in the public investment realm. What's their PE? What's the forward PE? What's the PE gonna be 2 years from now? Those are all short term questions and there's still a ton of uncertainty between now and potential profitability, and sometimes a stealth competitor that moves more efficiently wins the race, on a long horizon that makes little old me without the capital to shape their company strategy someone just buying into promises, which there's sometimes something there. 

I do like their niche, and with this crazy market companies don't really need revenues to soar so I may miss out on a big gainer, but I'll prob have my money somewhere else for a year or two as I evaluate their progress, if it gets too rich for me by then well I guess it'll just be one I missed.; Why not COST too while were at it; What I mean Is have the money saved ready for go day; Even if Starlink succeeds in matching ASTS technology, (they're years behind at the moment) and they both get a fleet of satellites, there is still room for competition. Billions of people around the world, lots of countries and phone companies. Not everyone will be willing to join a Musk led company anymore. Countries and companies may even see him as a security risk.; They have zero revenue. It can cease to exist tomorrow.; They certainly won’t.  There are plenty of CAT-M devices that don’t.  There is almost no use case for FWA customers to use ASTM.  And why would carriers tack on a mandatory $2 charge to prepaid customers (their most price conscious)?; Why would EU block this? EU usually fights against anti-competition. This would bring competition to the traditional antennas etc.; They have been doing the beta testing for a few weeks for the original roll out plan. Which from what I understand is starting with more of a poor connection/emergency response situation and going from there. 

Not personally on T-Mobile or know anyone on them because of how bad their service is in my area. Did know someone who used it during the hurricane, said the connection worked well. But he was also saving power he was not on his phone 24/7 for me to ask all my technical questions. 

There is also the fact that AST is having to go to SpaceX to get their satellites launched because of how much the rest of the competition has mangled their rocket programs. 

My point is this, I don't know that I have seen enough out of ASTS that says ""we are still in the front"", that they may have actually been distracted and as no one was paying attention, Musk got an extensive network in place. So now it is the matter of what matters more. 5G but not enough coverage, coverage and probably needing to catch up on some of the call quality. 

Seems like it isn't a sure bet on ASTS.; I see, what's the timeline to completion from now, 4 years?; They've already announced their cadence next year. 1 sat on IRSO in Q1, 2 launches on Falcon 9 w/ 4 ea in Q2/3, 1 launch on New Glenn w/ 8 sats in late Q4 for a total of 17 in 2025; So far SpaceX, Blue Origin (Bezos), and some Indian company; Bluebirds are dpacemobile satellites, Blue Origon is Bezo's rocket company and the rocket is New glenn. 

There you go my friend.; Ah excellent thank you! I had just edited my original with what i had found too.; You're talking about Out Of Band Emissions (OOBE), in order for SpaceX to broadcast at their max power they need a waiver to relax requirements for additional OOBE that their analysis, and T Mobiles, shows does NOT interfere with ground based telecoms. 

Of course AST and their friends are claiming it does interfere (we haven't seen anything that wasn't redacted so can't independently agree with AST) and are pushing back hard. Of course this is likely a stall tactic to delay SpaceX from rolling out more service. In any event, SpaceX can still get around this with new satellites and meanwhile ASTS application with the FCC is still pending for over 9 months...good luck boys.; No not how it works. Smaller sats will beam larger cells on the ground, larger sats can create smaller cells. And cells cannot overlap just like for regular cell towers. 

To have the best performance you need to create the biggest sats in order to have smaller cells with each cell reusing the frequencies in the available spectrum. 
That's why ASTS has increased the size of each generation of their sats (BW3 -> BB1 -> BB2), which allows improved data rates each time. 

ASTS has been able to launch giants sats using their clever patented folding/unfolding mechanism. Starlink can not currently build and launch sats that big, that why Musk himself said their D2C service is only text for now; Exactly 😂😂; You lose your investment edge at that point. Your move is made on the run up to dominance. ; Institutions are gonna jump on this well before the lights come on and revenue starts streaming. You do have some time to get in, but trying to time this is not going to work well.; They have the money to launch enough satellites to bring in money, and have many avenues to raise more money.; Let's say that you're right so we can keep conservative numbers. You very well could be, so I agree, it's correct to stay consistent if we're going to be conservative with projections...

VZ + ATT go from 260M to 140M subs. If we assume the same ratio for Vodofone, it goes from 330M to 220M.

That's $140M / mo from the US and $44M from Vodafone / mo, or a total of $2.256B / year. At 80% margin, that's $1.8B earnings per year.

That's $12.05 EPS, for a share price of $241; Starlink D2C has issues with emitting radiation outside the alloted spectrum because the sats are not designed for this purpose. They transmit at a higher power and some of it leaks out causing interference for other users. This is why the FCC has not approved it and why the EU will never approve it in its current state.; I'd suggest you read up more on ASTS and their advantage. Your posts appear confused as to what they offer. Also, Starlink doesn't have satellites that can compete with ASTS in terms of bandwidth and to make existing ones even able to offer slightly better bandwith (still significantly behind ASTS) they need full permission from the FCC to operate in lower orbit. Even when the new trump FCC provides them with this, they will likely still get sued by the MMOs for interference.

I wish people would do some basic research before posting so confidently.; For global coverage? Something like that; So that is 

8 hopefully with Bezos (on the one he has been trying to get off the ground for 4 years)
1 Other 
8 on SpaceX

Might want to ask Boeing about those astronauts.; Spacemobile*, Blue Origin* lol; Yea that's not even close to accurate, for starters overlapping cells definitely works (all you ASTS fanboys love to talk about MIMO right?). Small sats can work together to essentially create a larger phased array (SpaceX recently included a diagram showing this in a filing) and Starship will enable huge satellites that will easily do what ASTS is doing. 

Feel free to disagree or ignore me but I'm genuinely trying to help...don't compete with SpaceX, you will not win.; Money they are currently paying to SpaceX.; We can also completely ignore the U.S market entirely and this stock would still be a potential Telecom behemoth. 

Revenue split agreements already in place with 45 Global MNO's representing 2.5 Billion customers outside USA including Rakuten Mobile, Bell Canada, Orange, Telefonica, TIM, Saudi Telecom Company, Zain KSA, Etisalat, Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison, Telkomsel, Smart Communications, Globe Telecom, Millicom, Smartfren, Telecom Argentina, MTN, Telstra, Africell, Liberty Latin America and others. 

I wonder why Starlink hasn't been able to ink these agreements as they try to pivot into the DTC market with satelittes that still can't achieve more than texting while AST has demonstrated they can stream youtube videos on a remote island requiring only 90 sats for global coverage vs the 20,000+ Elon needs to launch.; yep, I think I read somewhere that they need to put 167 more satellites into orbit.; Well, New Glenn is supposed to be launching on 12/31. Whether that happens or not is yet to be seen.

Carrying cargo and carrying people are apples and oranges. SpaceX had no plans to be bringing those astronauts home, so it's hard to fault SpaceX for not being ready to jump. On the other hand, Falcon 9 has an amazing track record for cargo launches. There is a risk that Musk loses his damned mind and just tells AST to piss off, but I think I remember reading somewhere that he legally can't do that. 

I'm not going to bother to look it up, but something tells me he can't deny a launch simply because it's a competitor.; Thanks but I do not need your help lol. 

Starlink solution to the problem is just wrong and half assed. And they're paying the price with worst demonstrated performance and interference problems. Putting up thousands of sats in LEO is not the elegant solution. That's just laziness. ASTS has the right approach to the problem and is set to be the major provider for D2C broadband (only 90 sats for global coverage). The only problem is with funding and launch which will hopefully be sorted this year. 

Combine that with the fact that I sincerely believe that MNO will rather avoid dealing with Musk if they can and another (better?) solution to their problem is available. The DoD/Gov too would rather have increased supplier diversity than only relying on SpaceX, especially if another founder led innovative US company is available. 

You bet I am betting against SpaceX on this one. See ya in 2 years; For launching. SpaceX is launching their starlink competitor. Asts also has launched planned with other rockets; Do those MOU’s outline revenue sharing? That would be uncommon. They only have contracts with ATT, Vodafone, and Rakuten afaik; I completely agree, but it gets really tricky to guesstimate revenue from those carriers. As an example (and I have absolutely no idea what the actual # is), maybe cell service is like $2USD / mo in Saudi Arabia right now. What piece of the pie could ASTS hope to get from that on a monthly basis? $.05 per sub? 

While those carriers are great to have, revenue will mostly come from NA, Europe, and Australia, followed by Oceania and the ME. African countries and India have a shit load of potential subscribers, but they're very poor.; Around there yea, probably a bit more eventually with LEO becoming saturated with other SpaceX and China’s operators; Missed the point. Boeing was supposed to be bringing them home, now it is SpaceX. How many other contracts have converted to SpaceX because of failure to be able to deliver. (I lost count, but it is more than a few from the Biden  Administration alone). 

Those 8 for Bezos may actually convert to SpaceX. If he still can't get the ship off the ground. 

I don't think Musk would turn them down at all. It is less money out of his pocket ultimately, and that is the problem for ASTS.; Large satellites have drawbacks you know, they cost millions to build and launch and a tiny spec of orbital debris or a simple electronic failure can destroy all of that. 

We also still don't know for sure how well AST can control and maintain orbital altitude with that large of a sat, the drag on it is enormous and the relatively small current bluebirds lose altitude QUICK. They've gone from 520km to 505km in just over a month, how will block 2 do when it's even larger?

I get your points but frankly if you knew how good SpaceX is as a company and how talented their team is, you really wouldn't bet against them. Agree to disagree but yea let's check back; CapEx for building cell towers is huge. ASTS will be supplementary for coverage gaps in the western world. In the third world, it will likely be the only chance at connectivity a lot of people will have.; lol if you think phone plans in Saudi Arabia are $2/ month USD.... maybe do some googling around to see how much people pay for a prepaid 5G data plan in even the poorest countries of Africa and Asia...; Ahh, gotcha. I thought you were saying Blue Origin is a toss up (agreed) -and- SpaceX could be a problem as well. I'm pretty sure SpaceX will launch for anyone for the time being.; The average cell phone bill in sub-saharan Africa is $5-$8. The average in India is about $3. The same $3 in Indonesia. Saudi Arabia is about $34, so I was off on that one.

Regardless, it's folly to assume the rest of the world is willing to pay what people in NA or EU will pay."
18yo just started stocks recently besides some stupid options plays,I am barely getting into actually buying stocks and roth ira and I would like to gather any advice that will help me out. These are some of the stocks that I have recurring investments in. Anything I should add or take off?,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hn190p,0,2024-12-27 00:35:21,"People will tell you to diversify because you are all in tech but I think being young you can afford to take risks for another 5-7 years until you should consider diversifying more. Keep an eye out for some speculative stocks that you could see being worth much more in the future and I think you should invest more in these at your age than you should when you are in your 30s. Now is the time that you can take some risks that can pay off later but be very careful about this. At your age it might be harder to distinguish between a risky play and a stupid play. You start to understand the difference with more experience.; Just buy VTI and VOO and anything you can spare to never see again in BTC; Do not listen to people here if they are telling you to buy crypto or any non ETF tickers. They’re sitting on bags and want those bags to be worth something. I’m guessing the next person to post will say some sort of Penny stock.; This has all been either sarcastic or intentionally bad advice. Please head over to r/bogleheads to learn more about early investing. You should have more than 5% of your portfolio in individual stocks until you learn more about investing. Start by building a solid foundation. Most people use VTI since it covered total US. Then they add in some international VXUS. You can also skip two funds and just buy VT and own the world while you are still learning.; Are you only investing in Roth right now? Just remember your contribution limits.; You’re doing great. Keep the contributions going and forget about it unless you run into any financial issues. If this is ALL retirement money, you might want to consider investing just regular everyday money too. 

My general rule is 15% of income to retirement. Everything else I can save goes into stocks. QQQ is my biggest one. Then some TSLA and others. But I really think TSLA is overvalued right now.; gamestop is debt free, with 4.6billion in cash and profitable; I’m not tryna be teach bear, I have a lot tech as well but maybe diversify a little more. Maybe some JPM for the financial sector and COST for consumer defensive. 

You have time on your side so pullbacks aren’t really an issue but tech is notoriously high beta so you’ll feel it when downturn happens.; Bitcoin is better👍; Put in % 
Also buy GME; gamestop; I second $VOO. My roth ira is 100% into it since 2015 and I've had healthy returns, but I suppose that's subjective.; Yes only roth; He’s 18, he should be taking as much risk as possible now.; I’d wait to buy it at like 35k after the next dip though.; I almost upvoted this because I thought it said Puts on GME.; Also, just remember that it is in there for the long haul. You cannot withdraw from your IRAs until you hit the age....blanking on the actual age at the moment.; Lmao if you think it’s going back to 35k ever again then I have a bridge to sell you😂😂😂; Lol I remember when someone said that to me after it hit 69k the first time and I said I’d wait for 30k. I actually got in after it hit 15k."
New Investor Give me tips (18 yrs),H,https://i.redd.it/37andlcl999e1.jpeg,26,2024-12-26 21:48:31,"Never enable options trading or margin trading as a beginner.; Never eat yellow snow.; Don’t take advice from readditors. DYOR.; 1.) don’t try to “time” the market, buy in at regular intervals at a set pace that you can afford. I.e. $100 a monthly, weekly, etc. if you do this, you will find your stocks rising in a healthy way with less extreme ups and downs. 

2.) invest for the long term, don’t put any money in the market you’re not ok with going into the red (negative return) for at least 5 years. Covid 2.0 or some other economic disaster could be around corner and nobody would know. If you had money in the market you will need in 5 months it could screw you and make you take a heavy loss on your money. 

3.) don’t panic sell at a loss, the market will always go up over time. The market could crash tomorrow and your money could be down %70 and some will get scared enough to sell. Instead think of it as a heavy discount on stocks, the perfect time to be buying not selling. This followsthe most universal principle buy low sell high. 

4.) albert Einstein is quoted saying something along the lines of “compounding interest is the 8th wonder of the world.” Learn compounding interest, understand it, utilize it. It’s is extraordinarily powerful. The basic premise is this. If you earn %10 every year, the larger and larger the sum of that %10 will grow every year. 

5.) have an exit strategy. Set a goal, whether that be financial freedom, a certain percentage return, retirement, a house. Set a goal and abide by that goal. Money has no use if you don’t eventually use it for your life.; Put money in and forget about it.; Never underestimate the power of compounding interest and a simple DCA routine you can sustain.  Lots to be said for time in the market with ETFs.; Keep doing what you are doing.; Stick with ETFs.  They have Apple Nvda and tsla in them anyway.  So if you want more risk go more on VOOG versus VOO; If I were you. 3 Things:

1) Buy the obvious - VOO/SPY. Dont bother to research too much because your own research and judgment depend on how much you know.

2) Buy often and as much as possible, at least 30% of what you make in total. Dont care about how much it grows or waste time waiting for the price to go low or where you want to be. Best if you automate this stuff.

3) This is the most important one. NEVER SELL.


Have an emergency fund in your chequing account.; Don't open a trade without an exit plan.; 2025 will be the age of AI, and all the years after that, AI is going to be huge, you're going to have to go buy some, stocks in the chip space; But some PLTR; The only tips you’ll get are VOO and hold. I’m 19 and the only thing I can say is keep doing what you’re doing. Got plenty of time and room to take some risks. Personally I like space stocks because I believe in our lifetime space travel will become more prominent, I’ll list a few but many people will also call these meme stocks so best to do your own research. LUNR, RKBL, QBTS, ASTS. On a larger scale AMD, GOOGL, MSFT, META. Open a Roth IRA and max it out every year if you can and focus on ETFs. Like I said I’m 19 so I don’t even have the proof yet but this seems like the right path.; BBAI, great buy on SOUN, just a bit high but then again everything will be high (I got in 1k shares are 2.13). 

Look into UAMY. China ban confirmed for antimony imports UAMY will go thru the roof given they are the biggest and most established US antimony procurement of metals in the US. 

NVTS another id look at 

Diversify into crypto XRP limit buy at 2.00 either scalp (dry limit sell 2.90 or keep accumulating up until about 2.25 and hold. This has the biggest potential to go parabolic price point wise within the next year; Fbcv; i believe you are looking for QQQM, not QMMM; Do not listen to anyone. Analyze the graphs religiously they are predictable. But most importantly be ready to sell at any moment; Tip:   Its not a horse race where you just put money on a name.; -Max your Roth IRA. 
-Dollar cost average with automatic investing. 
-Don’t trade on emotions
-Don’t try to jump in on “hot stocks” when the market has them over inflated. 
-Diversify; Focus on maxing our your roth ira. Market is rigged and media will entice you to sell low and buy high. Never sell if you really need the money. DCA into the market and double your DCA when there is a market crash or correction.; Don’t emotion buy or sell.

The second piece of advice is from Peter Lynch, which is to stick to stocks that make a product that you yourself use and believe in. This is especially good advice for someone who’s 18 because those stocks should be appealing to this new generation and therefore have longevity.

I guess there is a third piece of advice, which is to avoid market disruptions and don’t go all in on one day. Try to invest the same amount on a regular basis whether it’s weekly or monthly or each paycheck.

I do have options in the company I work at but I get those for free.; 20% CASH (exited some positions recently, going to wait and see what happens post inauguration), 60% ETF, 20% Individual stocks with no more than 3% initial investment per stock.; Suggestion, Chip away at VWRL if there is a stock you are dying to buy.; 60% etfs (401k) and 40% individuals (private brokerage / Roth).; My TFSA- all my own holdings. 

My RRSPs and RESPs- all managed by various bank mutual funds.; 65% ETFs, 35% stocks; About 95% index funds (mostly FZROX & FNILX), 5% single stocks. I hold 36 different companies, biggest positions are NVDA, MSFT, and SYF. NVDA & SYF started out as [half-positions](https://www.financialsamurai.com/unsure-about-an-investment-decision-go-halfsies/) and grew into their current size.

My stock picks are doing well but I prefer to keep it to a relatively small amount so I can approach it as a hobby. I wouldn’t want to stake too much of my future on understanding Mastercard’s [blockchain strategy](https://www.mastercard.com/global/en/business/fintech/fintech-programs/startpath/for-startups/crypto.html).; 95% ETFs; I’m like you, probably 75 / 25. At the end of the day, huge gains on stocks are fun, but tax efficiency ultimately wins out. These ETFs they got now are the bomb.; 10% ETF (Roth), and 90% in GOOG, MSFT, and AMZN.; 75% etf.

My stocks are RDDT, HUBS, KVYO, O, and a little bit of DLR; 80% stocks 20% cash; 14% Cash

44% ETF

12% Individual stocks

30% BTC/Gold; I got about 100k in the S&P500 in my 401k, and like 90k in individual stocks between the Roth and brokerage account.  I've been trying to keep it a 50/50 split; About 50% indexes. Mainly VOOG and some VTI.

Then MSFT, AMZN, GOOG, COST, NVDA, TSM in that order.; 100% ind stocks; 100%; Just had to look! 60%stocks, 40%etfs. Ive been increasing etfs more than stocks this year but some of the stock I have killed it! 

TSM, Amazon. 


Additionally I have GOOG, penny stock G E V O, and Microsoft. 


Ill keep all these. G E V O has a lot of potential imp but it's been a bumpy ride with huge gains and losses this year. Well see, it's my get rich stock if they succeed.; I have a little under 25% in individual stocks - a mix of decent dividend paying stocks such as banks, pipelines, telecoms as well as Nvidia and Amazon. I only plan to DRIP into these so they should go down as a percentage over time.  These are legacy stocks from when I was 100% individual stocks. 

The rest are in global equity ETFs such as VT, XEQT (Canadian - since this is where I live) and a balanced Swiss one from when I lived there 75/25 equity/bonds. I also have a <10% bond ETF. Going forward, I’ll likely just reinvest the dividends into the non-Cdn ETFs with new money going into XEQT. I’ll think about rebalancing 5 years from retirement.; Good question. Roughly 50% individual stocks and 50% mutual funds. Of the mutual funds, it’s about 40% large cap growth, 30% mid cap blend, and 30% small cap blend.; 50% ETF, 30% diversified Holding Companies who claim they beat the market (Berkshire + some others), 20% individual stocks (a few high conviction companies). The actual percentage fluctuates but this 50-30-20 is the goal.; 100% ETFs; Right now, over 75% in index funds (like QQQ and VTI) which will change within the first weeks in January to SGOV or USFR.; For retirement/tax advantaged accounts: All ETFs. 

For taxable portfolio: 70 percent ETFs, 30 percent stocks.  

My taxable portfolio is probably 10 percent of my net investments.; 80% VTI, 10% individual stocks, 10% fixed income; Generally I focus on leading stocks only. The only way to outperform the market consistently is to be consistently invested in the stocks outperforming the market; 25% index, 70% stocks, 5% crypto/PMs; \~60% voo qqq meta amzn. \~20% dripping spyi arrc jepq. \~20% puts/calls/etc.; I'm an active fund manager, so 100% into the fund that is 100% stock picks. But I've always been 100% stock picks since I turned 18, 26 years ago.; ye? what individual stocks did you used to be invested, in out of curiosity; Same; Same; Individual stocks make for a fun experience. Also ive had some ETFs that went nowhere. There are plenty of ETFs that have gone nowhere for years and will continue to do so.; How's the performance? What are your top picks?; Fantastic! Could you share this year picks and next year’s?; A lot of different things, made money on all of them.. bought META after it crashed (sold too early though). A bunch of Canadian REITs at pandemic lows and sold before interest rates came up, Canadian banks and Railroad stocks, Telus, TSM, Suncor, SIA.TO, EXE, JNJ, Google, Enbridge, BAM, Amazon. 

Also a bunch of Canadian penny stocks with a low amount invested. I kept them but they don't really count. Mostly all went to zero or close to it. Only did well on PNG.

The only real stock I kept was BNS because I didn't want to sell at a loss at the time. I'm debating selling now it's well into the green, or just enjoying the dividends and likely some share appreciation.

I may make additional larger stock purchases in the future if I see something that I really think will outperform.; Pltr,rklb,achr,joby,asts,lunr,grab,clov,lcid,hims,sofi,vrt,nvda, AMD,tsla,dell,mu were my picks this year; Top gainers for 2024 were;
Realreal,
Palantir,
Soun,
Sofi,
Ttwo (take two),
And mag 7 (kept buying all major dips)

Next year betting on;
Ttwo (grand theft auto coming next fall, will shoot the stock up imo),
Otgly (cd projeckt),
Realreal,
Celh,
Huma (humacyte),
United health,
Sofi,
Micron (potentially)

Also need to do some research for next good opportunities.

Hope it helps; Also, micron has been steadily bouncing between 80s and 110s.. made some money swing trading it; I am in a bit of a pickle - allowed myself to buy way too many different stocks. I have a few too many ETF’s as well. How did you sell you individual stocks - when they were up and then just dump into an etf? Do you have any ETF’s with covered call strategies?; A bunch of those did really well.  Where did you hear about them?; Thank you!!!; Yeah I just sold when they were in the green.. even though often times it can be better to sell at a loss because you buy something with better potential. I just lump summed into ETFs. I probably have too many ETFs too but I think it really matters that much. Mostly different versions of similar things.; Covered call ETFs are awful and should be avoided.; Most of it was a mix of ""I love space"" and i learned about lunr from their 1st attempt in February thst tilted on the side. Nvidia I caught it late but as a gamer I should have had this for a long time. A lot of them was discovered as I found some community like Amit on YouTube who does market open and close. Some discovered by accident. Some times I sae a random ticker symbol on wsb and did my own DD. A mix bag of things. For 2025 I don't know what I'll do because they are all bangers and for some of them I'm gkad I got in early before they become even bigger. I always complained how I never find good companies to invest in a long term and now I have lol. I learned about options this year too and now I'm thinking of keep the same strategy. Be conservative with calls options that are well priced. Sell CCs far OTM (my account doesn't allow selling of csp) and buy only when there's a dip. I used to invest in the Canadian(because I live there) market and ever since I switched to the US market this year I've made more gains than I had in 4 years from the Canadian sector lol.; I have a similar profile.

Read about them on here.; K going to sell the one I have; That was easy and I hope you do dump it. They underperform terribly and offer little actual downside risk while capping the upside. 

Simplify as much as you possibly can and you’ll be put in fewer tough spots. As much as I loved buying individual stocks it takes time real time to listen to conference calls, look at financials, and even then most of the time I would’ve been better off in Voo. Now I just watch the Fed, pay attention, but don’t have to get in the weeds with individuals. Good luck; Done!  Made some $ and collected lots of dividends"
Need some help. What do you guys think about AMD long term? ,"so I have about 100 dollars into AMD at the moment. Looking for advice onto whether keeping it or selling it off for MSTR, ACHR, KULR, etc. what are your opinions off of what AMD has done with their new gpus? How much are they into AI? I want some insight since people here have a lot of research and knowledge! Average cost is 144.92, so about a 13% drawdown all time. Would you guys recommend something else other than MSTR/ACHR/KULR. Here is the portfolio. Any advice is appreciated and welcome! ",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hmv5k4,16,2024-12-26 19:56:20,"AMD is a good company with great leadership currently undervalued. You decide; I bought 5 grand worth when it dipped down to $118 a share a couple weeks ago.

Good company, great product, great management, it just doesn't have the software stack that allows it to contend with NVDA's CUDA at the moment. I think they will do plenty of growing as a company as the AI boom continues, they may never be as big as NVDA as they had a giant head start but you will pay too much for NVDA if you are buying now or anytime in the near future. AMD is on sale and does not have a decade of assumed growth priced into it like NVDA does now.; They have good products, but on AI front (data center), they are lagging behind NVDA due to CUDA, which NVDA has spent decades building it.; Undervalued but performing poorly in the market. I own a lot of shares and am loading up. I think they’ll at least be way bigger in a fee years; I would try to buy single shares instead of fractional shares first. Then add.; Some people call it ""Advanced Money Destruction"", think about it.; I would put the money somewhere else.For sentimental value I would keep some depending on your budget tolerance; Amd is good. Its valued where it should be imo and i think itll go up.

Im in intel because i think its dramatically undervalued; AMD will grow in the coming few years. Their alternative to Cuda, RoCm is catching up to Nvidia tho their still new to the AI GPU space while Nvidia has been in for decades. They are working on the software issues for RoCM and hopefully efforts will be made to address it in 2025 as the CEO received feedback on it. People were saying the same thing between intel and AMD, and AMD beat intel. Products wise, they are going to release new GPUs for their data centres in 2025 and 2026. Maybe u should watch the CES event in Jan 6 or wait until the earnings report before making a decision. Their competiveness won't be dying anytime soon.; I am not sure but from what i've heard there seems to be more trust in de long-term prospects of NVDA.; i think its fairly valued/slightly overvalued rn, look at its valuation ratios compared to it’s competitiors; Apps; I have positions in Nvidia, TSMC, AMD and Intel (largest to smallest positions in that order). Semiconductors, in general, are a good market to be in and each of them are compelling for different reasons. The market demand for chips is so high that it’s far from a zero sum game at the moment.

What AMD has been able to do in the CPU market since the launch of Ryzen has been remarkable. Nobody building an enthusiast system has a compelling reason to use Intel CPUs right now. Unfortunately for AMD, GPUs have been driving the most growth for several years. First with crypto and now AI. AMD needs to make up some ground there to see real growth. 

Right now AMD is conceding the high end/enterprise GPU market to Nvidia and Intel has had some recent successes in the budget market with their ARC GPUs. The middle isn’t a great position to be in for GPUs because PC enthusiasts are usually building on a budget or throwing money at the top of the line parts. And enterprise users are scooping up the high end stuff from Nvidia as fast as they can produce it. AMD really needs to solidify their GPU strategy and put out some compelling products. They may have cornered the PC market for CPUs and console market for APUs, but that’s small potatoes compared to the server farm business.

I’m a little concerned that they’re handcuffed to TSMC, which is risky from a geopolitical standpoint. In fact, one thing Intel has going for it is they’re a US fab. Ironically, that helped AMD get ahead of them, but it could just as easily bite AMD if their partners don’t keep innovating on their ends. 

Overall, I still like AMD; their design focused approach helped catapult them ahead of Intel for CPUs. They also have sort of a folksy underdog appeal that keeps people loyal to their products, which have been very good for several years now. I plan to increase my position when I make my 2025 Roth deposit, but I’ll probably hold firm after that at least until I get a better sense of their GPU trajectory.; [removed]; Not a good stock buy Nvidia instead or Amazon; To my knowledge amd is still king on cpus and have been that for about a decade so i would say amd is good long term since you cant run any computer without a cpu.; Currently undervalued but could stay undervalued for years.; They beat Intel. But they cannot deliver the software what AI/ML need for their GPU stack, this is a real risk of AMD.; Thank you! How do they stack up against Nvidia long term?; Couldn’t agree more!; Unless they really keep up with nvidia in 2025 they’re going to get left behind like they did in 2024; Yeah but they will get a share of that market and already are so they don’t need to be the best. Nvidia can’t supply everybody. There is so much demand; This is my “play” money. My full investments are into ETFS and such.; So what do you recommend instead?; Like? I already have about 15k invested into the s&p 500; Well thank you for the insight!; Well thank you for the input!; Why?; I’m only 28 I can wait 😂; Agreed. It’s a bet on leadership; thr truth, terrible. they are laggards. and little chance to catch up in regards to GPUs. They have a good CPU but it doesnt make them competitors in the industry. IMHO AMD is laughable and should not be looked at for gains anytime soon.; Seems like you just looked thru a week of wsb and then jumped ship on most talked stocks. Love it op; Lol you're buying AMD with your play money? There's way better short term momentum stocks right now; Probably hedge. For $1 NVDA buy $2 AMD. Could also add $1 AVGO.; Means other than AMD,as a single stock.There are better ones.S&P ETF(s) that’s a different subject; It won't be long, the future is the age of AI, and it can't be separated from chips; Current pe ratio says its not really undervalued. That being said I own it at 120$ share average.; I mean Lisa Su just won Time CEO of the year so leadership isn’t a problem haha; Idk it’s been working. It’s gambling for a reason LOL; Like?; Xilinx acquisition makes it seem much higher than it really is; It is if she doesn’t get software in order, current reviews of it are not good; Gme; In disinclined to respond to idiots who ask for help while down voting the person they ask advice from. Enjoy making no money from your awful investment strategy. The ole throw shit at everything and see if it works "
Which of these Stocks would You totally avoid? ,"I’m starting out my stocks journey and investing $1900 as the start then 60/40 into large/small caps. let me know which stocks are bad and why please (to avoid)

",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hmuge2,99,2024-12-26 19:24:37,"Those are all great stocks. I would avoid the ones I don’t know anything about.; I like the MU and MRVL stocks.; Tesla, not because I think it’s necessarily going to tank, but because it will go up and down based on the status/perception of the Musk-Trump relationship and I’ve had it with roller coasters. I like the rest—reliable, predictable growth. I’m not super confident on Tesla’s business.; Honestly, Tesla. The evaluation makes no sense.; Meta - steady cash flow king in advertising/AR glasses

Amazon - safe conglomerate

Tesla - slightly speculative robotaxi play; S&p; XIC has underperformed the sp500 by 330% over the last 14 years.; Costco and Tesla. Valuation will reset eventually it’s hard to envision multiple expansion from here.; I love Costco but it has gotten too expensive; Tesla is a ponzie scheme; Never invest in a company that cooks their books; TSLA WMT AAPL AMZN COST

Bubble territory for the next 3 or 6 months...; Tesla. I have principles.; I’d etf it if I was you.; tesla, especially with elon elevated presence in the trump administration. stay away until a couple months after inauguration imho

its already overvalued as is; I’d avoid Tesla. Has a long way to drop of him and trump break up; Tsla mrvl definitely in current level; Meta,  Costco, Tesla, Xic

Meta because advertising isn't going to be pulling money in when everyone is struggling for basic goods, Costco because the margins are already razor thin in that industry and tesla because nothing about that balance sheet even comes close to explaining the stock price. It's ridiculously over priced. Wtf is Xic? Pass.

 ; You're doing solid,  

Just $TSLA , it's hype based on Elmo and the potential benefit of him being US president by default.  Me think that it's grossly overvalued. I would get some of my profits and remind myself not to be too greedy as I fear a little rug pull on that one.; None!; Starting with $1900 and asking Reddit to pick stocks? Bold move, Cotton. Let’s see how that plays out in the stock market jungle.; Tesla is probably the most volatile one here; All of them. Buy ETFs instead. If you want to add risk, add leverage to one of the indices.; I won't own TSLA.  Erratic CEO, poor quality control, limited product line.  The fan base is the only thing keeping it going but it isn't as resilient as Apple's.; I see you have CAD hedged stocks, how long do you plan to hold them? I have been trying to figure out if I should go with hedged or unhedged; Pretty good companies mostly but how will you track all those? Even hedge funds limit the number of companies around 40-60 with a team of analysts. 

I would honestly go with an index fund like VTI or VOO first to build your base. Then add some tilts if you want like SMH or something down the road.; Walmart and Costco...; PRLD. ; Today I sold my MU position for more GOOG. Nothing that it answers you question, but that’s the direction my portfolio is taking heading into 2025. I’m all in on PLTR & GOOG; Those CDR stock are worth it or not? You keep them long term or trade them often?; Tesla is risky but should not avoid. I would make it lighter portion of your portfolio but I would keep it.; [removed]; OP, what made you choose CDRs for MSFT and GOOG, but not AMZN, COST, or WMT?

You have a lot of great companies there that are worth holding for the long run. Have you considered focusing more on ETFs for S&P500, Nasdaq, or DJI instead of spreading yourself so thin on individual picks?; I own some of the stocks mentions and am pretty content with them. I don’t own META.  For bulls what is the most compelling reason to own META his stick. I know younger generations have dropped it as it is used by lots of older users (my wife for one) with the fickleness of trends why will META be one of the dominant companies in five years. I am not a bear or bull on it. I just am interested in hearing from people on why it will continue to thrive (or become more irrelevant if you are a bear); Great companies bought at high prices are more likely to make for bad investments. Then again nothing makes sense anymore.; - make a whole list of stocks

- upload to Reddit

- Reddit isn't even on the list; I'm ngl, just put your 1 grand into voo or vti....; That’s bait.gif; You can pick 3 ETFs that would be 80% of your portfolio.; I love the $40 in XIC 😂; What fees are you paying to buy individual stocks?   

Personally I would stick with an S&P 500 no-fee ETF until you have more money saved.; META, best fundamentally, but always a scandal away from -40% drawdowns; SMCI; Dump TSLA immediately; GOOG - with the antitrust suit, looming sell off of Chrome, and overall continuing trend of de-Googling from some of their online services, I would avoid their stock.; Costco; Look at Reddit it’s at its predicted price, but I have a feeling it’s going to be parallel. What made up pretty soon.; No debate. Micron.; all of these are top tier.  micron is definitely smaller but I own them, so I'm probably impartial.  lol; [deleted]; Probably microsoft because it’s the worst mag 7.  It grows slow and its PE ratio of 36 is pretty ridiculous compared to the others. I would never buy microsoft because I would always consider at least google, meta, amazon, or nvidia over it.; MU; Tesla. It's expensive and much of the speculation is based on the idea of political influence, not the strength of the underlying business.; I wouldn’t touch TSLA. It’s a casino at this point. You’ll probably see it go higher but who knows how much higher?

Someone’s going to be left holding the bag and it’s not going to be pretty. You’re better off putting money in companies that aren’t so overpurchased.; Hey what r u doing with my portfolio!; Tesla and Walmart. Tesla makes no sense from a value perspective unless the robotaxi works out (which seems very far away esp compared to waymo) and Walmart pays employees so little that they often rely on gov assistance/programs. I don't support that business model; I’d avoid COST, trading at a valuation higher than NVDA and it’s a warehouse club. 

Incredible company, but come on. That’s one to buy on a deep, multi-month market correction though.; Just buy an etf; All good stocks. But I'd increase shares in Google & Tesla and sell Meta.; MU personally, its projections have gone down a lot over the past year; Tesla, but only because I think the CEO is a massive sack of shit and I hope the company crashes; META, TSLA, APPL - they are too influenced by media and brand fans; I personally avoid apple, just because their revenues have capped off the last couple years. And I avoid Tesla, for obvious reasons. Of the rest, there are a couple I'm not familiar with, so I don't go into them, I don't do Walmart because I think my money would just be better in Costco.; It depends on your strategy, but if you aim to hold these long-term and want good diversification, I would recommend theses:

Amazon
Google
Mastercard
Costco
Dollarama (a suggestion, as I believe you’re in Canada)


You don’t need to monitor them frequently—just set price targets and buy at favorable prices.; Tesla all the way..that company is propped up by hype and manipulation; Walmart; NET and GOOGL; [removed]; MU and CostCo. Holding MU now. Sold Cost 2 months ago.   MU CEO is a let down, stock trades in range of 90 - 110 and they are selling commodity and tied to PC. You want an AI play, go NVDA.  MU is SanDisk 2.0.  Cost is ok but trades at a premium. Pick 1, WMT or COST... Good luck!; They’re all pretty good. I think Walmart did the worst of all of them this past year.; Idk what is happening with wmt; MU. biggest dissapointment of a stock. Never performs. It sounds great on paper but it always underperforms; TSLA easily - as others have said it is beyond overvalued, margins have been compressing over time and it is just bid up due to Elon. It’s the closest thing to a true dotcom bubble ready to burst we have in this market.; all of them right now. Time to go cash; MSFT, COST; I would avoid MU.; I see tesla has been mentioned, and so has costco.

I personally think apple has about 10 more good years. It's definitely a fringe perspective. As a brand, they were built on innovation and performance dominance.. they have neither now and are clinging to a perception of being elite. I feel it will be figured out, and people will trend back towards performance and innovation. 

P.s. this is just my perspective, not a recommendation. Always keep in mind that the stockmarket is legal betting, and you are betting on investors' perception of a company and not the companies true value (i.e. tesla); TESLA - dumpster fire waiting to happen lol. And we all know it, even those holding it for dear life lol; Costco. Sell that shit.; TSLA, because Elon is crazy. He is alienating his base customers. It is also way over priced now. No way Trump can help the company that much. They are not the only one in the robot taxi business waiting for regulation change. My money is on waymo because it is easier to modify cars into robot taxi than making new cars.

Costco & Walmart: Tarrif may hit retail. Too risky until we know what kind of tariff we will get.; NET; Tesla at this price for sure!!!; TESLA; AUR is a great stock and company.  Watch the Working docuseries on Netflix to learn more about the company.; All of em; APPL is a loser in my book; All of these are bangin, can’t go wrong, I’m a holder in most of these myself… I suspect they’ll keep goin up until the bubble pops; TSLA; All!

Bitcoin only; MU is a cyclical stock. Check the draw downs in the past. It has data centre revenue going for it I guess.

But still have a review; You hold S&P500 in addition to stocks. This indicates you don't have a concise strategy. Imo, EITHER, hold S&p500 or do stock picking. Only pick stocks if you are willing to put considerable time into research.

Personally i just ride thr s&p500.; meta, wallmart, google, amazon, and tesla.; AMZN is headed for some serious trouble IMHO. They’ve actually reached the point where they screw over vendors so much that a whole lot are simply throwing in the towel and are working hard to make the customer experience untenable.; buy Nio
easy 10$ soon ; Nancy pelosi sold half of her Microsoft stock - rumour is Microsoft will be forced to split part of its business off; theyre just companies

company going downhill? avoid it. company just staying afloat? avoid it.

Stick to something like Tesla with very high prospects and low potential for consistent failure; TSLA doesn't have fundamentals. The P/E ratio is insane, it has incredible competition and no growth strategy. It's all based on Elon hype. 

I won't short it because stupid keeps it propped up. But it'll eventually fall. 

Toyota is a better car company and Waymo is a better AI company.; This is the realest answer by far.; I own both and approve this message.; Tesla is losing steam everywhere. Liberals hate musk and don't want his car, EU as well. China is catching up and sell their own cars; Also, I work in IT and their automated driving systems (visual) seems bad conceptually compared to the other prevalent system (LIDAR); Meta since they are not inventing, but monetizing by copying.

Tesla since Elon have lost it. 

Amazon, since its to big and diversified for its own good. And cloud will grow only so far.; So you're telling me they're due...; Costco has always been expensive. I remember not buying it under 300 because it was ""expensive.""

It's certainly not something to take a huge position in due to that downside risk, but slowing building a position is fine.; When Nvidia reissued their stock I was kind of expecting other companies like CostCo, Netflix, and Meta to do something similiar.

It is weird to me that they haven't, young people who might want to get into investing are going to have a hard time owning 1 stock in something and it being 15-20% of their entire portfolio. There is a psychological barrier to entry there that I wonder if it is having some kind of cooling effect on trade.; Just used my costo card for the first time. 2 of 3 food items spoiled. My little anecdote.; Yes all these are good but tesla depending on his goals; extremely volatile; Many feel that owning Tesla stock puts them in the ""I am virtuous"" camp (I know this is not what you mean by principles).  But the virtue depends on what state and county you live in, and what resulting percentage of the power grid has its power generated by burning something.  If you are a Tesla owner in West Virginia and do not have solar, you are mistaken that you are helping the environment by having a BEV.  Coal fired power plants dominate there.  If you are in Eastern MA, then 52% of electricity is generated by burning something, and 6% of that comes from burning trash (they actually do that).; why is that; Just ask Rex Tillerson; Worst advice ever; thanks! would you say now is a good time to buy everything? or does it seem like the market will crash? (not everything on that list, still narrowing it down a little); Sounds like you're emotional.; not asking reddit to pick stocks. Asking which I should avoid, if there’s anything in particular i’ve missed about the stock; The word on the street is that unhedged always wins in the long run. I buy unhedged whenever I can, but sometimes it’s unavoidable like the CDRs OP is holding.; avoid or invest? and why?; wealthsimple; OP, I should prolly change them for US stocks instead then, better than paying the fees long term; I would say that because they are coming up with newer innovations besides facebook. They own instagram, and they recently created those AI glasses.  I’m sure there will be many more inventions to come from them. But which of my stocks do you hold if u don’t mind me asking; You know that the antitrust is incredibly unlikely to actually hit earnings and funda right? Chrome sell off is not insignificant but not enough to be bearish. Please explain your de-googling line can't understand it. I'm not gonna quote quantum or ""AI leader"" as catalysts for growth bc I remember the quantum computing bull run during COVID. Companies like that only rocket during times of easy money, bubbles, and low interest rates. AI will be just as commoditised and available as the internet is today. AI capex is important, but being a leader is irrelevant as it will become as commonplace as a desktop in the future. However, Google already has a platform that people constantly use and they can use their reach to pitch their AI search, too. They have all your data and they do have a valid AI use case and still a bull case is more than viable.; 🤔 please elaborate; Stock splits don't have a material impact on the company or its stock fundamentally. There are just more shares.; ""It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price""; then there’s this guy😭😭😂; thanks!; i’ve heard this one? Because of their debt? their performance looks decent tho.; looks like a pretty safe investment imo tho?; Bet. Have you heard of TCS?; hahahah never. Crypto isn’t going anywhere; the ETF doesn’t bring in the best returns though. A little slow. this is why i did both. However it is safe obviously; That's a fundamentally flawed mentality.

The S&P 500 (and most mutual funds or index's) were created for instant diversification and also to adjust varying risk tolerances. Owning stocks and index's is what lots of people do, me included.

The reason? I have 60% of my portfolio in index's as a risk tolerance safety net when (not if) the market goes down, the other 40% is individual stock picks. Why do I do this? Well to give perspective S&P YTD as of this post is up 27.23%, my portfolio itself is up 54.83% YTD (thanks 2024 blue chips!).

To sum up, having 100% in S&P 500 is not bad at all if you're a new or ""lazy"" investor, but neither is owning S&P 500 and some stocks inside of the S&P 500. Both are good choices. It's not wise to just buy S&P 500 and say ""Oh well, now the 500 stocks in there are off limits"" however, it makes no sense as an investor to do that.; invest? or avoid; I literally bought all 5 of these today while the Canadian market was closed. 🙈; Third party seller services are about 20% of amazons revenue-even if half of them threw in the towel Amazon would be fairly untouched; would you say now is a good time to invest? I’m wanting to put money into stocks but market seems to decline??; You’re down -80% and wanted exit liquidity. 

Nice try.; Lol; I don’t know who the CEO of Toyota is and I like it that way.; All depends on your investment philosophy. 

If it’s value investing, sure, I agree with everything you said.

If it’s yolo investing, 

Or bear with me, investing to get yolo investors (aka momentum investing), TSLA might be a fine choice, even if it’s not my choice.; Zeekr; Yup, Tesla is used for swing trading nothing more. Literally nothing they do is leading.; It does have a growth strategy, fully autonomous vehicles/robotaxis. I severely doubt they could get it to work any time soon so I'm shorting it; You probably bought dell when apple was out too.; xD comical; You're sleeping; No growth strategy? Are you a real person?; I mean I could see you thinking it is very highly valued but overvalued is a judgement call that cannot be reduced down to high price vs current earnings.

No fundamentals it has grown cash flows consistently for many years at profit margins well above the rest of the industry.

And no growth opportunities?  I see more teslas on the road each year and they continue to try to land full self driving which seems like a big growth opportunity.

Not a new buyer or owner here but also just think this dogmatic kind of valuation is pretty thin and kind of just comes across as one of those people who hates Elon.  Which is fine but I try to keep emotion from my finances; You have no idea what you are talking about; Wow! Tesla is my biggest position and has provided financial freedom. WILL BUY more shares if a decent pull back occurs.; Isnt MU doing horrible tho?; Big fan of MRVL? What do you think price target will be 3-5 years from now, and why?; You should drive one, Tesla is ahead of the game.; Have you tried it?  Tesla automated driving is quite good now.  It has improved significantly, even over the past year.

I felt the same thing; extra sensors sounded like a great advantage over vision alone.  But functionally, Tesla's vision-only system is quite good.  And Tesla's system is more flexible than other systems that rely heavily on high-resolution mapping.; Worst advice ever; THATS THE ATTITUDE; Yeah can’t knock the company just doesn’t fit my investing style. Let’s say eps growth is 10% for the next decade. Imo you’re still likely to have well below market returns. 

Forward p/e is like 52-53ish. Average p/e for Costco while expensive is let’s say 35. A slight revision to the mean takes away all returns and it’s not a big dividend payer. And that’s just saying it comes back a little bit towards the average. What if it goes all the way back to average, what about lower? Then you have a downright terrible holding despite it growing the whole time.

A company with the reliability and track record of Costco deserves a premium no doubt but that much? The odds of it staying there indefinitely are so low.; Costco will continue at a premium because of incoming inflation and the expectation that will drive record sales for them.; I’m not talking about share price, but rather price to earnings ratio; Off topic, but you can return it for a refund.

Companies aren’t fully judged by customers on their ability to serve without error, but also how well they are able to correct any issue.; Stock picking is extremely risky compared to index fund investing; More exposure. 

What I found helped me was buying s&p500 and small cap etf. DCA that.

And on the side. Purchase sector/niche etf. Eg, semiconductor, uranium, solar, oil/gas

I didn’t have to worry about the individual companies, I traded the market segment and not the company; A) Time in the market beats timing the market.  As a retail investor, go for the long(er) run. 

B) If I had the answer on what to buy and when, I would be a billionaire. 

C) I bought $NVDA in 2009 and sold it in 2010. Up 70,000% since.  That tells you how much I can predict the future.; Well, if you're just starting out, it might be wise to reduce exposure to high-volatility stocks like $TSLA and shift focus to steadier earners like $WMT and $COST for better risk balance 🤔; Why is it unavoidable?; Specifically and mainly because Walmarts are closing and Costco is related to or with Walmart (without specifics cause of time right now) and they're closing to basically turn into processing centers. The original owner (and it's still in the same family line) comes from a family of eugenists that basically had the same business model that Walmart does now. (In short) This is why I would avoid them; Nothing wrong with those CDRs in my opinion. Yes, they have some fees attached to them but I have a few of them in my portfolio and have been happy with it. 

The alternative is paying fees for USD FX. As I’m sure you know, the CAD is down big. I do believe it’ll eventually even out a bit. Might be a few years but it’s always something to think about.; Goog MSFT (for more than 12 years so I have done okay) AMZN (also have had for a while) I had Wal Mart for a while but sold it a while back.  I am looking for some nor tech stocks maybe ones that aren’t as well know by Main st.  Have bought a couple and hope they are the grand slam like the ones you noted; Meant to say more tech stocks not nor tech stocks.  Sorry about that.  I guess I have Fat fingers; Betting on a dream. Better competitors. Dump MU and run.; [removed]; This is Cloudflare; Apple isn’t a loser but they’re too expensive for what they are.; I suggest you take the time to learn. do not take random mambo jumbo from people who didn’t put the time to educate themselves. 

This is the same reaction people had when email started, I still remember the last guy in the industry that insisted he’s sticking to using a fax machine. 

I don’t think his business is still around anymore. 

I’m not saying go buy, I’m saying is to spend 6-7 hours to start learning. Then make the decision from a point of knowledge not rumors; What he said is incorrect.  By owning a combination of the two you expose yourself to the consistent return of the market while overweighting yourself in stocks you’re more confident on and hoping to outperform based on those.; Meta will be around for the next 40 yrs and outperform sp500. Buy just that; why walmart, i get its overpriced but isn’t it great long term. And why meta bad; avoid.; they beat all production target numbers not priced in yet ; I’ve always said I have never once heard about the CEO of Costco and it shows.; I think when you are a boss of a company you should know how it all works not that you just bought it cuz ur rich. Toyota ceo loves cars and can drift, used to repair and race cars; He is brilliant; It was Mr. Toyoda but I think he retired in April.; At the same time, everyone knows who the CEOs of Apple and Amazon are & those are incredible companies.; Zeekr is sick. I wish we weren’t escalating tensions with China so we could get some of them over here. $GELFY; Tell that to the people who bought a few years ago and have seen it double several times.; Buy some GOOG then to get the Waymo exposure.; You will live to regret that. Don’t bet against Elon😏; Theyre a real regarded person, thats for sure. They only know their politics tell them he's against their religion so he's evil. They cannot think critically about tesla. Its impossible for them. No advantage? Jesus fucking christ. RemindMe! 3 years; On top of it all, it has multiple verticals as well as the brand and manufacturing infrastructure to build and integrate them all under one thing. They literally have 0 competitors who can operate on their level, and that’s not opinion - numerous CEOs have been outspoken in saying what Elon has been capable of, no one else can do. Jensen Huang is plowing money into Tesla, and legacy automakers are failing left and right to develop and successfully deploy comparable products profitably.

I’m an Elon maximalist, yes, but that’s because I’ve done an extensive amount of digging and can’t find anything to the contrary. TSLA is so damn high because each of its businesses is rapidly dominating and becoming profitable. The stock price is a result of institutions plowing money in because they understand the vision and advantage Tesla has.

But then you have people on Reddit whose knowledge comes from…idk the hole in their ass?; Tesla all the way, all who are doubting Tesla because they dislike him. Need to detach themselves from their feelings & realise that it’s not just a car company, do your research. If not I can assure you will regret not jumping on the train 5-10years from now. Wake up the world we live in is changing & changing fast. Exponentially to be precise, then again it is said that the human brain finds it hard to understand exponential growth. This is not a dig on anyone it’s just facts; Most analysts like it in the longer term.; hasn’t made progress just horizontal movement; Zack’s has it at a 34% long term growth rate, but only a $120 12mo price target. It’s had a big run, so I’m guessing it flattens out for a bit before another AI fueled run.; Compared to companies like Waymo is seriously doubt it. Tesla is a company thats very much in your face with marketing but then underdelivers.; Admittedly I haven't. I can imagine it works great in good weather conditions. In theory, in bad weather (fog/heavy rain/snow) LiDAR should work much better.; Why even invest if you are making decisions based on emotions lmao; Why even invest if you are making decisions based on emotions lmao; Do you have degrees from uc berkeley and ucla, and grew up in silicon valley?; I agree. That's why I only have a small portion unless it does dip dramatically. At the end of the day, they're a grocery store and shouldn't demand such a high P/E. But it is well run.; Thank you costco guy; More risk more reward; I wouldn’t say stock picking is “extremely” risky. But it is riskier than index funds I agree. Just stick to large cap or blue chip stocks and you should be good for the most part.; i’m thinking of going for small cap etf for a big chunk of my 40% small cap investing strategy for sure. then for large cap  investing in maybe 7 or more companies. not sure what you mean in investing in individual companies, don’t you need to invest in a company which is in your energy sector for ex? or do you mean you just know those sectors will always do good long term no matter which company you put your money in; for “A” your saying i should just buy now then? I’ve heard this saying before. I agree because prices will always go up. But i never hear them say this about crypto; both way too overpriced. I have them in mind just waiting till their P/e ratio decreased or price decreased; Some ETFs and these CDRs only offer hedged versions. Therefore if you want those ETFs or CDRs, the hedging is unavoidable.; How is Costco related to or with Walmart?; What do you think I should do. i’m not sure too much of the difference between both. I’m a canadian citizen. or which would you recommend to hold in cdr and why? i think it’s better to change what i have into usd currency. better than paying an annual fee on the CDR. I think it’s prolly better to pay the buy and sell exchange fees especially when the USD will outperform CAD.; bros username is also KULR; is it a safe buy? i heard they have debt or something relating to expenses/debt ?; Prospect for future growth? The brand is not dead but it's definitely not growing. Even Buffett thinks so.; been in crypto since 2020. Hasn’t made the progress I’ve wanted it to. Stocks are definitely better off for retirement and long term growth. Stocks you can always build off of with small amount of capital. But crypto needs a big investment to see growth to start off with (for those less risky cryptos).; Yeah I thought so too. I’ve heard many people do this and invest in several ETF’s both holding the same stocks too for ex. Just diff strategies in each, and holding %.; They still think having thousands of quick swap batteries lying around not being used in storage is a good idea.; He’s good.; Amds ceo is super; Probably because it changes all the time; Lol what? Tesla didn’t have a single product when Elon bought it. He was deeply involved not only in the car design, but the construction and tuning of the factories and assembly lines. This is like 5 minutes worth of Googling.; More like forced because nobody believed in his vision to stick to hybrid only...and now they are like "" maybe he was on to something...""; The stocks doing pretty well and has given me pretty good gains! I see it being $90+ this year; I have already lol, I'm down bad. Still think my bet was correct, it's just going to take a long time to realize it; Yeah, I can't stand the guy but the path ahead is clear and almost guaranteed.; So, I'm an auto industry analyst and you're talking out of your ass. There are multiple manufacturers that are 12-18 months out from eating Elon's lunch. Tesla's tech is indisputably good, but they have proven time and time again that they simply cannot produce a car that has the level of market appeal that we see from Toyota or Honda. Quality consistently takes a shit when they scale. Hyundai, Kia, Volvo, and MB are all making a much better car with quality tech and have more capability to scale--all without mentioning that Musk is incredibly polarizing.

You've got Chinese manufacturers sitting in the shadows waiting for an opportunity to destroy everyone and Rivian/Polestar have a growing presence in the niche corners of the domestic market.

Tesla is a fucking meme and, IMO, a gamble. Bound to blow up the second Musk loses his proximity to the White House and the government's money cannon. Space X and Star Link are more akin to arms manufacturers insofar as their viability is wholly contingent on government contracts.; Quality is in the hole for Tesla, they keep moving the goal posts for self-driving cars/taxi service, which I get you have to sometimes push things back, but at some point you're just failing to deliver on promises, way better battery tech coming from other venues where Tesla was admittedly at the forefront at one point, other EVs have caught up to Tesla, and to top it off their CEO is shitposting non-stop on his social media site and driving a lot of potential customers to other companies. Trying to be a realist, there's money to be made in the company no doubt, particularly given his legion of fanboys such as yourself and his current close relationship with the incoming admin, but the company now is not the same as they were 5 or so years ago.; They seem to have a lot of partnerships. Not sure exactly how much longterm growth, maybe $200 a share 3 years out?; Exactly, stop catching feeling😩; Nicks a coward; It’s currently a stock pickers market.; I’m bias here. Fidelity has a nice fund and etf selector tool. I’ll browse the different themes, check out the ETFs, look at the performance, allocation, and expense ratio.

From there I make my picks based on what I know in the industry and market.

I like tech and pharma.

I came from telecom snd there is a big gov funding to get 5G and fiber internet to pretty much everywhere in the USA. Even the small fish have access to the capital. So I’ve been buying.; A)  as part A 

I am saying don't try to time the market unless you really know what you are doing.  Stay away from meme stocks as they are often pump and dump. 

Price will go up, unless they go down. 
Do your research on what you want to buy. 

Crypto is purely speculative, there is no tangible assets behind it.  You can make money,  or not.   Your call.; Keep in mind maybe that Costco has seen success internationally too. I personally live close to a non-US Costco and dude, that building is packed. Maybe factor in some foreign growth?; “Without specifics cause of time”
Is the new google it!; I mean, the FX fee is usually 2.5% each way, and the fee on the CDR is only about 0.5%, plus it offers hedging (if that’s your thing). 

I don’t really have advice for you (nor am I qualified to give advice) besides telling you that I own plenty of companies and ETFs in USD, and also have a handful of these CDRs. 

For the companies that offer CDRs, I buy those. Otherwise I’ll buy in USD.; [removed]; Speculative, serverless edge computing; [deleted]; Apple AI, healthcare services (eg airpod hearing aid breakthrough), widely growing software service division, and still strong hardware sales to boot. 

This is a pretty delusional take tbh, considering they've outgrown the SnP in YTD, YOY, and 5Y periods (and 10yr, 15yr, etc). Buffet trimmed because Berk was way overweight on Apple, and had a favorable tax opportunity pre-election w/ democrats expected to increase LT cap gains tax. Last part ultimately didn't pan out but both those reasons are more accurate than ""wasn't growing anymore"", which is just categorically nonsense.; Been in crypto to me means that you traded some shit coins and other tokens. I wouldn’t. And I seriously think that you underestimate how big bitcoin will get. (I don’t really care about the other coins, whatever multiples I’ll make of those I’ll exchange to Bitcoin.)

Those that will hold even a fraction of Bitcoin will do very well. Just my thoughts. 

Best of luck; Keep 50% or more as a core in the broad index funds. Then you can go nibble at other stocks. 

It at least gives you a chance at outperforming. You could underperform as well, but at least you're anchored by the core funds.

If you find a small cap that 10x's over several years, and you have 5 to 10% in it, you've significantly outperformed. If it goes to 0, you moderately underperform.

Just need to know what you're doing and not buy based on hype and fomo; they did millions of swaps. 
swap in under 3 minutes. 
many regions in china only have 1 phase power not 3 phase so swaping still is needed for some ; Costco has had 3 CEOs over 40 years, the entire life of the company, so that's a lie.; You can always order a box of pliers from Costco to remove your foot from your mouth.

!RemindMe 10 years; 🤣; First Google result “Tesla was founded in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors. Its name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, Elon Musk joined as Tesla’s largest shareholder; in 2008, he was named chief executive officer”. He literally bought into it. Stop licking elons ass now. Also I never mentioned Tesla once yet you came to a conclusion it’s about Tesla. There are thousands of manufacturers who bought the companies. Maytag appliances was one of the best and they were bought by whirlpool which turned them into basic ass appliances.; That’s what I’m saying. I don’t have to agree with Elon on fucking politics to know that they have a massive data advantage in the AI world. I cannot name a single other company who has a moat as deep as Tesla when it comes to their specific use case for AI. Not one. The headstart with economical bots that are scalable and the massive unparalleled super computers both Tesla and XAi have make them a force to be reckoned with. Comparing them to a car company and saying “BuT mUh P/e RaTiO hErDuRhUr” is next level regarded. Elon’s fight with Biden and him getting revenge is irrelevant.; Yeah auto industry analysts have been saying this for 12 years now.

My family friend is an OEM for legacy auto and they have been saying the same thing for years now.

The problem with being an industry analyst is while you become a specialist on comparing a Ford to a GM, you will miss the bigger picture because of how much you have married yourself to legacy auto.

Willing to eat my shoe if there is a legacy auto player who has a better selling EV than a Tesla in the US by year end.; The infighting has already started and the inauguration hasn't even happened yet 😂🍿; I read some of your reviews and our 12 year old daughter is months away from surpassing your work quality; Agreed.  And maybe it corrects downward.  

I was just trying to steel man a case for why it might correct upward and that markets are pretty good at pricing things that it is not so cut and dry.

Had to pipe up when one dude on Reddit saying it’s P/E is high and that they dislike Elon and that is the extent of their valuation.

Lots of headwinds.  Others may catch up but they have proven unable to.  My assumption is because they have long supply chains and are all positioned around internal combustion and their talent is not tech based.  But I must say have you ever sat in a Tesla and had it drive you around?  It’s not all vaporware.; Okay i see what you mean. Stock prices now are extremely many at ATH, I do suspect them to go down at one point soon, it’s just a matter if i’m willing to wait 6 months to buy at the low peak of the arch. A recovery in the stocks seems to take a year (at-least with the last recession). Regardless it’ll go up at the end of the day; aren’t they all😭; But I wanna know now 😠 na jk I’m guessing b/c of their competition with sams club?; shit goes vertically up. Don’t expect it to keep going. Volatile af; Wasn’t that crowd strike??; Choose words carefully, delusional? If the company was continuing to grow earnings why would he have sold? Growth has slowed in China and let's see what happens with Tariffs. 

All the while, if you don't have an iPhone now, chances are you're not going to apple watch nor air pod. It seems the market is quite saturated with overpriced electronics. Better growth elsewhere in the AI trade, such as energy and in GaN semiconductors.; They have got no revenue growth, and they are priced like they should have been 10 years ago. 40+ p/e, in my books, requires 10%+ growth per annum over a decade. No doubt Apple still has prospects and a little bit more room to go, but people (including myself) believe it is too richly valued and we advise the OP to stay away and pick companies with larger margins of safety. That's all. Ofc you could still outperform if all your bullishness is accurate. Cheers!; Apple is growing, not fast enough to justify their PE; Unless you’re holding a full bitcoin, you wont make the safe ROI as you would with stocks in 10 yrs for example. Bitcoin has gotten too expensive. I’m not saying you can’t make money on Crypto, but it sure is very difficult to work with the market analysis. It takes people years to learn it, and certainly is not easy. This is why many people prefer stocks as for the majority of the part your stocks will always rise. That’s not the case for crypto, as you will need to know when to buy and sell to make your profits.

|-|-|-|-|; Lol are you illiterate? You didn’t read my comment or your research.

Elon bought into the company - nobody is arguing that. But the company had nothing but a name at that point. Everything after that point was him. That original company didn’t have plans for 5 cars, a tractor trailer, home solar/energy, and robotics.

Seriously you’re just low IQ.; [deleted]; I think Tesla's long-term viability and it's stock performance are totally separate conversations--it's clear that the stock price is astronomically high for an auto manufacturer for a while. We've (myself included) have historically hand waved it because there was some semblance of the valuation that was based on the fact that they're a disruptor and people want in on a newly popular technology. I think we've crossed the threshold into meme status, as is evident by the price surging and falling as a result of Musk's public stunts.

As for traditional OEMs? They're doing a lot wrong and I'm hardly viewing this through that lens. Tesla's success for the last decade has been built on being an aspirational, disruptive (tech and design), fun company with a CEO that people viewed as funny and/or quirky. Here we sit in 2024; they've not really updated their design language since the launch of the Model S in 2012, it's not aspirational compared to Rivian, Porsche, or PoleStar, and the very public CEO is deeply disliked by a large portion of the most likely customer base. Momentum? They do have some of that, but they're a smaller percentage of the overall EV space than they were a year ago. Rivian and Polestar have launched highly successful models, Porsche and VW are refining tech, GM is the second largest EV manufacturer despite Tesla having a decade + headstart. BYD is already larger than Tesla internationally. Tesla have already seen their market share erode through 2025 and the trend seems to be accelerating when you look at actual data. Any growth they had in 2024 was strictly a mechanism of lowering prices and the overall EV market growing.

Their only real opportunity to gain that market share back is to either hope that the CyberTruck stops being such a joke or to continue vertically integrating until they become the default budget option. There is only going to continue to be more competition in the space as the overall share of EVs reaches that 10% threshold.

So tell me, what do you base your assumption on other than vibes and a dying trend? Hell, novel and verifiably correct information would honestly only benefit be as my ability to provide my customers with the most accurate information is my sole concern in the vertical. I’ve backed Tesla’s model many times in the past, but outside of the used market, I don’t have a favorable outlook beyond the next few years.; Let’s hear your analysis on the brand and where it sits in the market…; Yeah, I'm just saying foreign Costco is just as popular as US Costco so they  have an identical bull thesis internationally which you could be able to use to rationalise the price.; Just saying foreign Costco is just as popular as US Costco so you could extend the runway and bull thesis to justify the valuation; [removed]; My bad. Too early; I just told you why he sold, you either ignored it or can't read. 

What makes you think Apple has increased political risk relative to other tech giants that run supply chain through SE Asia (almost all of them)? Why are you citing hardware concerns when the business model has clearly focused on a shift to software over the past five+ years? Why would Apple not be considered a serious AI play with their Apple Silicon division, strong fab partners, and large ecosystem for deployment?

Maybe delusional was harsh, but you definitely have no idea what you're talking about if you think Apple is poorly positioned right now.; They’ve beat revenue estimates four earnings reports in a row and have had 10% total rev growth across last two quarters, so no idea where you got that from. Not seeing how the PE point is valid for OPs watchlist when half the companies listed have a higher PE than Apple, and less historical upside. 

If you’re bearish on Apple, you’re just bearish on tech. They aren’t trading particularly forward and historically they’re one of the safest high-growth tech stocks ever. ; Not really, they’re pretty in line with other tech giants in terms of PE, and certainly not the worst offender on OPs list. If you’re going to argue apple trades too forward, then most (and nearly all tech) companies are trading too forward right now.; The fact you think bitcoin is too expensive makes me believe that you seriously underestimate where this is going. That’s ok too; Hahahah, perhaps they have seen many iterations of Costco come and go. Only 2 things have been constant, the hot dog deal and rotisserie chicken prices; StopHesAlreadyDead.gif; Yet again the first link off of Google “Martin Eberhard, an American engineer and entrepreneur, was the designer of the first Tesla car, the Roadster”. I mean I get it you love Elon musk but again my comment never mentioned Tesla or Elon musk. I couldn’t care less who invented Tesla and who designed it, I drive a kia stinger, love that car and that’s all I can afford. This is my last comment, I don’t have time or energy to argue with you. Take your own suggestion now and read my first comment again Mr literate person.; Lmao @ inferior sensors. See you in a few years. I’m sure you won’t block once you realize this shit aged like milk.; Hand wave things which you don’t understand; Rivian and Polestar outsell Tesla in revenue over the next 5 years?; pure meme stock. remember me when it crashes; Apple, the only thing saving apple is it's balance sheet. There's little innovative since Jobs died. What happened to the self driving apple car? Project was scrapped. Where's the growth? 8% projected for next year.. big whoop. Is apple now a value stock?; Other tech giants have more growth prospects; I’m not underestimating it. Bitcoin is almost at 100k usd…. Meaning that you will need to invest in a big chunk of a bitcoin to see some nice returns. Not everyone can afford a big chunk like 20k into one coin. Would rather diversify into stocks not only to diversify the risk, but also because they are safer. I get you’re a big Bitcoin fan, and I get where you’re coming from, but your honesty can’t just ignore all other investment opportunities. I understand that bitcoin could be the next future currency though. Doesn’t hurt to consider stocks…; Those hot dogs fuck so hard.; Rip - could delete but I own my own mistakes.; Polestar feels unlikely to me, but that is with little real understanding of their offerings or business. Rivian is only one of them I could see doing it if they’re able to get the price of the R2 down to something more palatable and if they’re able to able maintain good financials and pay down their seed money.
They will, however, continue to erode Teslas market share. 5 years is a long way off in tech-time any this corner of the industry is evolving fast.; [removed]; >There's little innovative since Jobs died

Apple stock was $12 when Jobs died (up 2000% since). Not to discredit the foundation he laid, but you'd have a hard time finding a finance professional who doesn't approve of Cook as CEO. Hard to take you seriously when your arguments are so goofy and uninformed.; If you don't care to elaborate on that we can just agree to disagree; I’m not saying get all your money and put it in bitcoin, what I’m suggesting is to slowly get off zero. I think most people lack of understanding to what multiples bitcoin is going to get to is what holds them back.; I’d bet my left nut they don’t.  5 years is a short time when it comes to scaling out auto production and getting new annual buyers.; I get their good for what they are, but just like apple, it has become more of a trend which substantially drove the price up more than what they’re actually worth.; Bro, Apple has had no revenue growth for years and it's currently given a 38 fwd P/E.

It's way overvalued. Case closed. Out of the mag 7, it and TSLA are trash at these levels.; Apple’s AI push is to get people to buy the IPhone which has seen flattening sales.  So they’ve sunk billions in Capex (lowering FCF) to attain this AI and it will most likely not succeed in driving iPhone sales higher and is likely going to be a wasted expense since apple AI sucks.  I’ve never heard someone say it’s useful or better in any way than third party AI.  Again, Apple isn’t bad or going down, they are just not worth the price in my view.  But valuation is by nature subjective so we can indeed agree to disagree.; If you're so adamant about btc being the best option, why not suggest all in..."

[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse); Fuck you. That's how my year went; I beat the benchmark only to get back to where I started thanks to MU; 1000% return this year. Expecting -99% draw down next year.; 60% on 100k investment in august. 50k in an ETF (+10%). Biggest profits are from RKLB, LUNR, RCAT. Only buying shares.; How did you purchase Reddit at 20; 148%. Still red all time. Terrible with timing. Leaps only nowadays; 400%.  All in on PLTR.; 230%

This isn’t normal for me. I aim for 60% per year so this was a knock out year

I did an annual recap/review of my best and worst trades: https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/s/FnYHlILVN7

I know everyone seems to expect next year to be amazing for the market, I have this feeling that it will be a bit underwhelming so I’m keeping myself a little guarded. I def don’t want to go super long on everything and round trip this year’s gains.; ""35% in my portfolio but other sources say 26%""

Found the Canadian 🙂

I'm at 52.87% at the moment. 
Epic year.  I've actually recovered from my 2022 plunge and reached a new all the high.; Nope, got fucked by AMD once again and am bagholding. After a bunch of winning trades I'm maybe up 10%.

I can't complain too much because AMD profits paid a lot of my house down payment and I got in $30 and have round tripped it many times.; 80-120%

It would’ve been like 500% if I hadn’t sold KULR at a buck and RGTI for 7 something 🤢; 58% green for the portfolio average.

Biggest wins:
* NVDA, 135%
* KULR,  105%
* MSTR, 77%
* LUNR, 61%

Loser:
* Advanced Money Destroyer, -25%; U guys have profits?; I’m one of the 1 in 1000 people that didn’t massively beat the S&P this year thanks to overpositioning in a shitty solar stock, I did 10% this year; +80% thanks to NVDA bought at 600ish pre split. Lost some on PARA. All shares.; \+46% YTD mostly on RDDT most of my investment was at $70 but I've been DCAing it up actually; I got a new job in May, paid off my credit card debt in July and was able to invest again in August. Up 86% since August; https://preview.redd.it/25q1n9ore89e1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f6c7b2b8f9388291299a521d5e30b77f09add76c

Up 261% YTD. All options, some bought, some selling for theta. The earliest DTE was 4 months out. Fuck weeklies.; 110% gain 1/3 in Palantir, else Google,Carnival,Amazon, Blackrock; Gotta practice hodling 30% up since oct. 

i’ve sold early too many times already; https://preview.redd.it/vczehnnys89e1.png?width=1279&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06c8d2b036327aabcddff600a31079ab1487d950

Not great, not terrible; won't know how much i lost on regarded trades if i don't calculate it ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882); -45%; I’m bullish on space and satellites. 

I’m currently watching KULR rip past $4 that I sold for 1.20 so I’ll have nightmares for the best couple weeks; Options portfolio: +500% YTD

Stock portfolio: +74% YTD; Up 193.75% as of today. Opened my account in late August. 

Mix of options and stocks. I didn’t have any goals in mind.; +16% overall since 2017, am regarded; Right now, I'm over 50% up YTD. I'm kind of happy, but I'm still down from ATH ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260); Still haven't recovered from 2021; +210% / 52K

Jacked to the tits on RDDT (shares and options); +100% crypto portfolio
+65% ROTH
+75% Options account

Index funds are for suckers; Can we talk about losses? I thought this WSB not Main Street Wins.; 300% up 100k this year; It was a good year! It would've been better if I didn't let 60k shares of RKLB get called away in August but over 200% for the year so no complaining on my end.

After RKLB, I ported LUNR. And I've basically swing traded that and sold some calls along the way. I've got a quarter of my LUNR sold on 16.50 calls that expire next week and I suppose I'll roll them next week and 12k shares left after Christmas Eve and today taking some more profit.

Next year, I hope to find some discount days and go at it again with RKLB and LUNR by my side. I have followed RKLB for years and I didn't think we'd see that runup till Nuetron but they're a beast. I can't be anymore bullish on space and those are my horses. Done great so far.; https://preview.redd.it/zw4w6wh2g99e1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f87e1c1346b430e18fd961f3e490822423dbc8c8

Can’t complain.; +230%. 


Big trades mostly on googl and nvda. Made a good amount on different meme stocks, space stocks, KULR, SOUN. Was a solid year..; 59%, almost entirely from Q4 when I decided to sell my ETFs and start picking stocks (mostly tech).; Bulk is in my 401k:

2022: -26.74%

2023: 31.61%

2024: 37.72%

Brokerage account: Can't figure out how to modify dates but here's what I was able to see:

5/1/2023-12/25/2024- 120.24% (Thanks NVDA); YTD: -5.3%

At 9/30/2024: -57%

It could be worse.  Yes it could be better but hell it could be a lot worse too.; My goal for this year was not to lose as much money as I did last year ($50k). 

I'm currently at -$30k, so success?!

(As a special kind of talent, most of the losses were SPX 0DTE calls. CALLS!!); WMT and NVDA. Buy and hold.; Over 100% in 2024. 43% in 2023.; First year where I really pay attention, redid everything in March.  Stonks only but total portfolio up around 40% and Ive made more than my yearly salary.   Great entries on RKLB, ASTS, PLTR, ARCHR, and LUNR.  All up from about 150-500%.; Up about 28% investing 90% in the S&P 500, and the rest in bitcoin and google. No options.; Great until the grench aka jpow got in tv and I decided to take an edible to sleep which actually made me paranoid and I decided to panic sell premarket after AI flushed.

So basically I'm fucked as usual; Best: mstr shares presplit
Worst: paperhanding crwd shares at the bottom; +42% but I didn't start this year until October so pretty dang good; -5%. I took a year off of day trading.  Didn’t pick it back up until a month and a half ago.  Was down 20% and got my sea legs back.  Just a little out of the loop. I should be at least even by 1/1/25.; NIO killing me but thanks to SOFI up 38% this year but only down 2k as of right now at point was down almost 20k.; first year and i’m up 156.3% thanks you to you idiots. portfolio now worth about $15k. My main strategy was not doing what this community said to do. KULR, RKLB, LUNR 🌘🌑🌒; Scams and fraud are the winners.....; Recovered all the losses from 2022 - 2023 around 50k and then some around 30k. Not much but still I am proud of myself.; Up 135% 
Top 5 gainers: 
RKLB
COIN
INTA
WMT
MRVL; This was my first year investing, I'm currently sitting at like 35% without factoring in time (I make deposits every month so I really don't know how to count that lol), which I am content at; Up 25%![img](emote|t5_2th52|31224). Bought 10k shares Rigetti @ $1.07 and sold @ $1.74. Bought back @ $7.20. Sold Tesla to soon. NVIDIA shares 1200% and cashed out 85k. Tax man eating me next year.  AMD and AMDL destroyed my portfolio.; 486% with how webull calculates it.  386% for normal profit calculation.  Just turned my account green after two years of tragedy.  Just daytrading dogshit topgainer low float penny stocks all year.; Up 38% since May. 50% in stocks, 50% ITM leaps on AMZN, MSFT, AAPL.

I’ve thrown away a couple thousand on random puts on meme stocks. They never hit. ; 326.64%; +720ish % biggest trades were a 6 bagger from VCF, lots of LUNR calls and wheeling shares, and RKLB (wish I held on longer and haven’t traded it since about $10)


The goal was to pay off debt and maybe get a new truck. Still a ways to go and I’m addicted to the thrill so debt will probably get paid off with bonuses while I make my milli. 


Worst trades: lots and lots of selling too early to tinker (sold 200 RCAT shares $5.64, sold 1000 shares of KULR at $1.28, sold 500 RKLB shares at $6.07) BJ wholesale screwed me over during earnings. Actually lots of earnings caused losses and for 2025, I’m not playing earnings. 

2025 plays: 

QQQ to $600 by 3/2025
GSAT to $5 by 4/2025
NOK to $5 by 4/2025
BLND to $6 by 5/2025
LUNR to $50 by 12/2025
Hold onto my shares and stop selling for lotto tickets.; Think mines like 183% YTD and 2000% overall.; +55% green port average.

Winners:

ACHR +81%
LUNR +100%
NVDA +50%
PLTR +50%
RKLB +310%
TSM +50%

Losers:
Advanced Money Destroyer -18%; I have three accounts, all similar sizes.  The one I'm most active in is only up about 5% for the year, because I chased a few biotechs in size after they got some huge approval (PHAT, VKTX, IOVA), and because that's where I tend to play with short-term options because it's an IRA.  Proving I suck. 

My other two accounts which are more buy-and-hold (one because it's taxable, the other because it's at a full-service place where I have to find the phone#and talk to a financial advisor to make a trade, which forces me to be more responsible and thoughtful, not to mention socially outgoing) are each up about 40+% for the year. 

Only one of the three is my go-to for FOMO or dopamine-seeking, and it's the one where I'm underperforming significantly.; Literally every time I look at the stocks I want, they’re like +400% on the month. Then I’m like surely this company with 30 people can’t surge that much more. Then the next month another 400%, I just don’t understand how everyone of these companies are just going bananas. RGTI, RKLB, anything with the name fucking quantum in it.; https://preview.redd.it/qjp9bffnx89e1.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9d90584f51db1d870afc06956af2aa6a7082bc7

i belong here ![img](emote|t5_2th52|18630); 1-year return in trading account: 76.26% with mainly NVDA, TSLA, BTC. ROTH is 37.32% with mainly boring stocks.; NVDA fucked my portfolio up! Had high hopes for that company at the beginning of the year! Not anymore! Sold my last 100 shares which I had profits. But sold all my contracts at a loss through out the whole year! Thanks to the CEO and his buddies for being greedy! I’ve never seen shit like this before where inside dumps thousands to million shares on a daily basis! Fuck them! I’ll be parking my money with AVGO from now on! Made a shit load of money with AVGO in a short time span!; +54%, started late july, probably +80% if crypto counts, shame i only started with like £4000 but its much better now at least; +106% right now.  Basically just watched my nvidia and fbtc.  Everything else I did was more or less a wash.  All shares, options have taught me I’m always wrong about timing.; 48% and believe it or not it's a diversified 100% long strategy. Just went overweight on Tesla and pltr so it's been good.; 134% some NVDA but mostly swinging (du-du-daaaahhhh…) FORD ATMs; I am up $312!...*almost*; 92% ytd return; Started trading at the start of October, up roughly 15%

did 2 meme options and lost $20 usd ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260); Overall up about 150% ytd, mostly thanks to a great eoy push from AVXL which I’m hoping will 20x in 2025; Up 71%, stocks only. Started my first portfolio 1 month ago, so my YTD is really one month in this case.

AI & Quantum FYI! (I'll probably crash at some point...); Benchmark. Lolz.; Started investing seriously this August, was down 10k at one point, then recovered to being profitable at $18k YTD! Outgained the S&P 500 index!; Up like 300%. Mostly from RKLB. Buying from SPAC, averaged down to ~5$. Then bought some more at 20 after it reached the peak and dipped.; +80% and biggest earners were Nike and HELE earnings puts; https://preview.redd.it/g9egimiia99e1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=34f35eaba4e0a3d7a5d9887900d3e8ef74565dd1

I did kinda well.; 250%; YTD: Down 28% because I bought event contracts for the losing side for the election (can’t mention name coz subreddit rules)

Had to take all my money out in 2023 coz I was unemployed. 

Hopefully 2025 will lead me to make less bad mistakes; https://preview.redd.it/5epwv94zb99e1.jpeg?width=773&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ce7b3826f738bea6fd220bfb50846aa57f608a0

Only shares, no options.; 409% on RKLB LEAPs; -80%; I'm up 324% thanks to you all.blew up my $30k Roth into $135k. Mostly from July and onwards; Fuck off with your returns; 82% up very blessed with nvda cmg Rddt and a few others; For whatever reason it doesn’t show my % on the YTD. That because I’ve withdrawn a decent amount? But, def my best year.

How? 😂 ; Started at $89k. Finished up 93% to $158k. Biggest trades were nvda and pltr; I lost 20%; childlike absorbed innate live worry scandalous bright spectacular weather dependent; 13.29 percent. I got caught in Mullen. But Sound, Archer and BBAI have saved my year. 

Honorable mention to Huma, VOOG, and SCHG.; Transferred my first $1500 12/17/24.  Current Account Value - $2111.89

So what's that \~ 41% percent in 10 days.  I have a feeling it's all downhill from here.

  
 Biggest gains were  
  
$284 on QUBT shares.

$165 current gain value of a HMC 1/17/25 call.  I'm hoping this is going to continue to grow a bit more too

I would like to think I did beat the market this year with \~400% return; Stupid ahh year. Right companies, wrong time.; started the year with 35k.  Pulled 35k out for house down payment, still have 30k left. 

I did alright.; 200% I didn't hear no bell yet either.; 159% in my taxable account. 

Made like 4x or 5x my usual annual income.  I assume next year will wipe that all out so I’m bathing in the glory while it lasts. 

About 44% of that was a large position in RDDT bought on margin Aug 2nd. Meanwhile I set my buy limit like a dollar too low in my retirement account and it didn’t get filled so missed out ugh.; Only 28% 😢; I was up 400% on my gambling account.  Back down to pretty much where I started because I held my long calls through the FOMC announcement like a moron.

My other account, which consists of shares only, is up 130%.; I finally almost broke even on my All time graph 🙏🏽; 78.6% this year.  Discovered I'm very good at buying the bottom, still working on finding the top; https://preview.redd.it/fzglyq70ua9e1.jpeg?width=1206&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af93568cf48a25335d3dae28db3bb30309a9ed62

Mostly NVDA, VOO, MSTR, and META.; Down 12% on the year, but if KULR keeps pumping like this i may very well beat the SP500 anyway. Index funds can suck my dick.; https://preview.redd.it/irnvczydya9e1.jpeg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d86b9082971db78ac5aaefc979ae1d0b47831900

Roth IRA did great. Mostly swing trading TSM, NVDA, and AVGO.

I didn’t start until half way through the year though. Was just sitting in a money market fund until then.

Year’s not over, and I’m doing well this week too just waiting to close out tomorrow.; 125% in one account, 166% on another, 56% in my 401k; +50%, that being said all options that I tried were losses, investments up bigly tho.; 18.82% YTD but LLY, LMT MU and ORCL suck donkey dick; Started investing this year and my return is +14.8% not too bad; I only started 3rd December and my portfolio is overall up 3.7%.

Looking forward to 2025!; +35%

Thank you ASTS. Fuck you DVN.; I shorted nvda through naked calls.  I clawed my way back to even the whole rest of the year.  I literally gave up the day before the top or I would have got all the losses back.  Such a pussy.  The position started manageable when Nadia was at 500, but by the time it hit 1400 it was just too big.; 2022 +51%

2023 +31%

2024 +93% more than half unrealised

BA and held until last month!; Around 150 percent on a couple meme boys. And some small cap swings. There’s never a high enough target but I’m ok with it.; Personal +3% - (my picks had terrible returns) only reason I’m green is the ETF’s. 

401k +13.65% - I’ll take it; 73% return averaged between 401k and Roth IRA.  401k is indexed, Roth IRA is nearly 100% PLTR.; I’m up 100%. Mostly TQQQ, FNGU and at the start of the year some cash. Let’s do it again next year with President Elon! 🚀; First green year since I started 5 years ago.  Good news is i was only down 2k since I started,  managed to make 700 back in the last 2 weeks. I could lie and say it's 200k total loss but I made 70k back this year,  just to try and fit in,  but the percentages are the same; +118%; I got 65% return ytd can't complain; https://preview.redd.it/a3vw5dngg89e1.jpeg?width=796&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e1ff725010d7cc4cbcbb8abff787e8a04aed1203; 408% heavy in NVDA and RKLB; Racist

But yes, fuck you it's how it's gonna end.; Where are these tickers, FUCK and YOU, I've been looking everywhere; FUCK MU; I on the other hand was saved by MU. Went all in on INTC when it was at $30. Got hopes up when it went to $35, then was sent to the shadow realm when it went down to $20. Sold majority of Intc when it went back to $26. 

MU saved my ass and got me back to where I started at the beginning of the year. +$1k. 

MU always hovers at around $110 for the past few months. Dips to sub ~$90 but always goes back to $110 range. Just kept buying and selling at ~90 and 110 and made a full recovery.

This new year i wont be a dumbass and will diversify. (RGTI and QBTS here i come); My Roth IRA beat the market 40% to 28%. But my options portfolio is deep in the red. Stocks are so much easier; Best trades?; 100% return on the same above shares + ASTS
 
Only difference I put 10k only.; LUNR I’m liking too; Nice. What are your moves for 2025?; Similar returns for me, good year thanks to TSLA, rddt and RKLB.; Probably a typo; Ya how’s that possible..; Sorry you are right, my avg cost is 70 lol; Yeah, it took me most of the year to finally only buy LEAPS when I'm making a larger investment.  My shorter-term call bets are extremely small now, just enough to scratch the itch.; Get the F out before earnings brother; yeah they say itll be good just to get you to buy while they all sell man; Yeah 60% per year is reasonable. 

I'm only down 25% this year, which is pretty good for me. Mostly because I was PDT locked for about half the year.; lol you got me. that's amazing!; How did you do in 2022 and 2023? Congrats man. 2022 hurt me bad. ; amd was one of my top 3 biggest purchases this past year, down 38%.; 45% of my portfolio is AMD and Intel and they’re both a bit sad; Dude…. Had 220k shares of kulr at a cost average of .239 or something.  Sold when it got to .34 or something and I thought I was hot shit.  Fuck me I’ll never forget about this one; hedge funds be punching the air in this sub rn lol; I sold KULR at $3 and now I’m questioning if I buy back in or just watch from the window; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); Was up 1000% YTD - erased by my MU Yolo last week. 🤣😭 merry Christmas; What drove u towards AMD? I own nvda and crwd but the consumer side is too dicey in my mind; Correction, you’re just the 1 in 1000 that is willing to admit that you didn’t beat the s&p. Whole lot of lurkers keeping super quiet right now. 

Yep we see you all 👀. Time to step into the light so people realize not everyone made bank this year; That’s okay, you tried your best I’m sure and not everyone comes away with a win each year.; Good job! Wishing you another great year in 2025!; Wow that definitely doesn’t look like my chart; bruh that's fckn amazing; I had 1000 shares of IONQ I sold for like $7.50 at a couple hundred buck profit. Turned it into about a grand of crypto gains. Was feeling good and then I saw IONQ share price last week

GUH; Best trades?; This is me

It’s pretty insane feeling; https://preview.redd.it/xvam1heoma9e1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b0a98b43a679a520eceda57fa65cd99ab2d0ff8d

My dad’s returns as of beginning of November; Honestly, imagine opening a hedge fund with all of us. We'll destroy the street lol. none of them make these types of returns smhg; What are you going to do with the $100?; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31225); My god that is confusing, you even suck at writing; Copped da big body benz she ask is it legal I say no bih it's a bugal

F-ck, I had 30 lots. F-ck; Aren't RGTI and QBTS already too high?; Just holding, dont see any reason to sell. Bullish on everything i hold. Big year for those 3 and ASTS and KULR. Also got some PLTR and RDDT. 

Also coming to wsb for the lulz; Don't think a LEAPS has ever paid off for me.; I hope you meant UP 25%?; I lost 51% in 2022.  It was brutal.  Stayed the course though, no panic selling.

Up about 50% in 2023 also.; I hear ya. AMD got hit by failing to take AI business share from NVDA and over TSMC geopolitical risks especially with the new administration being a wild card, and just generally failing to live up to high PE. But I am stubborn and  cannot accept that I'm wrong that the dominant x86 CPU maker should pump again sooner or later.; Bigdog, thats nightmare shit right there; Could’ve been 10 Lambos.; ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|scream); holy fuck I am sorry; That was me when I sold nflx at 5 dollars. Had doubled my money felt like genius; where did you find out about KULR?; Holy shit dude my heart goes out to you; nah they happy with their 1-2% fee for sure; Buy and it crashes; It has become more and more of a hedge over the year, in case something new and unforeseen happened. I started the year close to 60% NVDA, 40% AMD and paired down AMD more overtime. I was lucky timing-wise, selling the majority around $170. Now my AMD holding is about 5% of my NVDA holding. I wanted to keep some AMD shares just to learn how to sell covered calls, which has been nice to learn. Agree, the consumer side is dicey but interesting, with both AMD CPUs and comically, now Intel GPUs (Intel's latest Arc cards seem to be doing quite well for consumers). I probably won't sell AMD, instead just continuing to sell CCs until I'm back to even.; 100% faith in LUNR. 0% skill; Fuckkk😂; $SNOW netted me about $50k when I bought calls and shares for their earning. Also made a healthy amount on $SPY calls (still ongoing) from when I bought the dip last week, and also $RCAT and $BBAI calls/shares.; rent your mom for a night; Do you think if I got better at writing i would be a better trader?; All these racks gimme aboner

https://preview.redd.it/8mmjdf2ga89e1.png?width=234&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e9be6396e4dd22c1e2b3035fe0d3795be4d9f79; Take me on a date first at least. Chivalry is dead; Jesus Christ; Ho Ho Holy shit you belong here, Merry Christmas!; I don't do options, when you gain it's like having a hit all bases on the first date. If you lose, you beg for Vaseline.; They regards; And here I am seething over only buying 100 shares when it was at $7 just to test the waters. Rip


Welcome to clownworld population: 2; They are ripe for dilution, soon it will be water down whiskey. These companies need capital, they'll dilute.; Agreed. I'm gonna look into KULR.  What's your TP for RCAT and RKLB?; No, down. Actually it's -32%. I don't have data from before May when TDA merged with Schwab, but here's the graph since then:

https://preview.redd.it/2jchbevv4c9e1.png?width=1296&format=png&auto=webp&s=98c4d972f201af512ec0b3921da2e850aedff8bc; love that (2023 that is). looks like 2022 sucked for most (i was down 32%) but awesome recovery in 2023 (and 2024!). Happy new year and hopefully another great year ahead!; Keeping tech as a hedge at all is spicy. I should learn CC's w new broker.

I dont see smart CapEX decisions coming from intc or AMD, so a hedge for me is PG. Everybody needs toilet paper.

Whats ur hedge for 2025? Im going for cvna, since cars break and tariffs will wreck new car buys; Wait, I thought you only paid for her services, not buying dinner, breakfast for two + rent of the presidential apartment; possibly.  I could lie and say yes but you made 70k back this year, just to try and fit in, but the percentages are the same.; RKLB 45-50 if everything goes well with Neutron. RCAT 25; Honestly it’s pretty difficult trading with such a small account. I started a $4k challenge portfolio early December and my performance has been lackluster compared to my main account. Up only 2.5% on the month; I like the cvna hedge for those reasons. I think they still have room to run. I'm pretty bad at hedging tbh, I normally end up with a hedge within the same industry as my more focused play and convince myself that's sufficient lol. I've been wanting to find something medical/pharma, but haven't been able to pull the trigger on anything yet. This year my portfolio morphed to AI and Bitcoin waay more than it should be, but I guess I should appreciate its success. I need to shift back to something more balanced though.; i like your mom more, i'll do that with your mom and a few other mums i like even more, my 45k gains ytd should be enough; Why is a bigger account easier? I figured it'd be the opposite.; Pharma i dont touch after buying LLY too high and w new prez coming in

Mstr will sell for gain soon as bcoin hits another high. 2025 im big on crwd and smr. I truly think a cyber event will hit in 2025. Cvna makes sense as a hedge since the price of a fucking car starts at $40k; Because I can make trades on larger stocks. Like buying a call in Costco would be like minimum $2k per contract for an at the money call with 1 month of time left. This gives me much higher probability of profit and not force me to buy either super OTM or low DTE contracts

Also I can sell puts or buy a lot of shares and sell covered calls for income. Collecting premium really does add up. If you look at my annual review post, you’ll see why. I made most of my profit this year in MSTR/MSTU simply selling CSP and CCs. 

These trades are impossible in a $4k acct. Smaller accts inherently must take larger risks to make decent profits.; Ya, that's exactly what has given me pause. My coworker timed LLY really well this year.; Coworker was playing w fire. Health plans will get even more volatile on what they will/wont cover. Medicare reimburse rates will plummet. Etc"
Congrats to the new $1B space stock,"
Finally hit a Billy. Been waiting on this for years. $RDW is the Next Space Stock You Need to Watch – Bigger Than $ASTS or $RKLB?

NOTE: tried originally posting this on 10/14, 11/04, and 11/30 and WSB told me I couldn’t because RDW was “under 500m market cap” which is wasn’t … now trading >$10 a share. 

I've been following $RDW (Redwire) for four years now, ever since it IPO’d via a SPAC. I originally owned the stock back at the IPO, sold it before it fully crashed down to $2, and repurchased 10,000 shares at ~$2.50. I’ve bought and sold on the way up and on dips, currently holding 4,500 shares with a cost basis of $3.83. I also hold two call contracts at a $4 strike price expiring in May 2025.

I’m a long-term believer in $RDW and believe it has the potential to be one of the biggest winners in the space industry long term, with significant potential for short-term spikes. This post isn’t about denouncing other space stocks but more about why I believe $RDW can be the winner we all want and need.

NOTE: before diving in, this was originally written on Oct 14, 2024. I’ve since updated this with current numbers as of Nov 30, 2024 





My Portfolio in the Space Sector (Oct 14, 2024):
To show you my broader conviction in space, here’s a quick rundown of my other holdings in the space sector:

-$RKLB: 4,500 shares, 4 call contracts at $2.50 strike, and 2 at $5 strike, expiring in Jan 2026
-$ASTS: 1,000 shares, cost basis ~$12 (sold 2,000 shares at $35 on a pump)
-$LUNR: Sold 5,000 shares and 10 call contracts at $5 on a recent contract pump, sold another 5,000 shares @14.7. 

PORTFOLIO HOLDINGS UPDATE AS OF NOV 30:
-$RDW: 4.500 shares, 2 call contracts at $4 strike expiring May 2025
-$RKLB: 3,100 shares, 2 call contracts at $2.5 strike expiring Jan 2026, 2 call contracts at $7 strike expiring Jan 2027 (Sold 500 @ 15, 500 @ 20, 400 @ 23.5)

Bought:
-$ACHR: 1,000 shares @ $6.18
-$JOBY: 750 shares @ $7.21
-$KULR: 4,000 shares @ $0.55
$GSAT: 2,000 @ $1.89

Sold all of my:
-$ASTS: 1,000 shares @ 30
-$LUNR: 5,000 shares @ 14.7

But my strongest conviction remains with $RDW and here’s why.

$RDW Performance & Key Financials

Redwire has shown strong revenue growth but it’s flying under the radar compared to almost every single one of its peers. Here’s a breakdown of recent financials:

* 2023:
    * Revenue: $243.8 million (+51.9% YoY)
    * Net Loss: $(27.3) million
    * Adjusted EBITDA: $15.3 million

* Q1 2024:

    * Revenue: $78.1 million (+30.0% YoY)
    * Net Loss: $(18.1) million
    * Adjusted EBITDA: $1.6 million

* Full-Year 2024 Guidance:
    * Revenue: $310 million (+27% YoY)

For comparison, here’s how other space stocks stack up:
* $RKLB (Rocket Lab):
    * 2023 
        * Revenue: $244.6 million (+16% YoY)
        * Net loss: $(182.6) million

    * Q2 2024 Revenue: $900 thousand

Valuation Insights: Why $RDW is Undervalued

Now, let’s talk about valuation. When looking at revenue versus market cap, $RDW is trading at a much lower multiple than its peers, despite earning more and losing less than almost all of them. This presents a strong case for potential upside if the market starts to recognize its growth.

* $RDW 
    * Market Cap: $524.3M (as of Oct 14 at $7.88/share)
        * As of Nov 30, market cap is now $928.9m
    * Revenue multiple: Just 1.69x revenue
        * As of Nov 30, revenue multiple is 3x
* For comparison:
    * $RKLB: ~10x revenue
        * As of Nov 30, 25x 
    * $ASTS: 100x revenue
    * $LUNR: ~2-2.5x revenue
        * As of Nov 30, 4.5x
* Why This Matters
    * A lower revenue multiple suggests that $RDW is currently undervalued relative to its peers. It’s trading at just 1.69x revenue, compared to $RKLB’s 10x or $SPCE’s 15x, despite immense market traction and success. If Redwire continues on its growth trajectory, this gap in valuation could close quickly, creating a significant upside opportunity.

Proven Track Record

$RDW has been involved in space missions for more than 50 years, supporting missions to practically every planet in our solar system. 
* Sun: 3 missions
* Mercury: 2 missions
* Venus: 3 missions
* Earth: 20 missions
* ISS: 12 missions
* Moon: 4 missions
* Mars: 7 missions
* Asteroids: 3
* Jupiter: 2

Capabilities & Future Potential

Redwire is also positioned to be a leader in several emerging space technologies, including multiple areas I’ve seen highlighted for other companies in WSB over the years. Their capabilities include:

Redwire is positioned as a leader in several emerging space technologies that could be game-changers in the next decade. The possibilities here are immense—especially with space-based manufacturing, pharma, and autonomous operations becoming key areas of growth in the sector.

The Opportunity: Why Now is the Time

With everything mentioned above, $RDW presents a major opportunity, but here’s why now could be the time to get in:
* Outstanding shares: 66.54M
* Float: 24.26M (very small compared to peers):
    * $RKLB: 340M
    * $ASTS: 122M
    * $LUNR: 57M
* Short interest: 2.58M shares (10.62% of float)
    * As of Nov 30, short interest is 3M (12% of float)
* Average daily volume: 340k (very low compared to peers):
    * $LUNR: 14.2M
    * $RKLB: 13.1M
    * $ASTS: 16.9M
* Average Daily Volume as of Nov 30: 481k
    * $LUNR: 19.18m
    * $RKLB: 18.52m
    * $ASTS: 12.83m

Low float and low trading volume make $RDW more prone to sharp price movements, especially if the market starts to recognize the value that’s been overlooked. Add to that the upcoming earnings reports and potential contracts in the pipeline, and you have a recipe for significant price action.

Conclusion:
Given $RDW’s impressive revenue growth, proven track record, undervaluation compared to peers, and potential for short-term spikes due to low float and trading volume, this is a stock to keep an eye on. While I hold positions in other space stocks, my conviction in $RDW remains the strongest for long-term growth.
* Past
    * Jan 1, 2024: $2.96 ($196.9m market cap - lower than the 2023 revenue)
    * Oct 14: $7.88 (524.3m market cap)
* Today:
    * Nov 30: $13.96 (928.9m market cap)
* Future Potential?:
    * $20 ($1.33b market cap // 4x 2024 rev)
    * $50 ($3.32b market cap // 10x 2024 rev)
    * $100 ($6.65b market cap // 20x 2024 rev)
    * …you can do the math from here

**Account Age** | 4 months | | 

[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse); Thanks for posting this a year after it went up 452%. ; Excellent DD, I was looking to start a position in a another company in this sector and honestly $RDW seems like a solid pick to pair up with $RKLB.; # **TLDR**

---

**Ticker:** $RDW

**Direction:** 🚀 TO THE MOON!

**Prognosis:**  Buy and HODL.  Calls are also good.

**Author's Position:** Heavily invested (4,500 shares + calls) and VERY bullish.  Made bank already.

**Key Argument:**  RDW is undervalued compared to peers like RKLB and ASTS, despite strong revenue growth and a long history of involvement in space missions (it's been to *every* planet!). Low float and volume mean big potential for short-term price swings.

**Bonus:** OP originally tried posting this months ago, but WSB rejected it because RDW was ""under 500m market cap.""  They were wrong.  *Very* wrong.; KULR is absolutely ripping; Aaaand it just went up 5% 🤣; Own RDW too but in two years ASTS is going to be doing $100s Millions of revenue per month. But mistake selling out IMO.

Good luck with RDW - very interesting company.; Check out $LUNR. It’s on 💥🔥; Lol I saw some daytrader pointing out 2 months ago how undervalued RDW is. After a brief review of the company I bought in. This is gonna go moon. Literally.; Sure I'm in for an even 150 shares. More of it dips; Another R stock? Good; Currently I am all in on RKLB with like 450 shares, ready to hold and buy for many years.

Have been thinking about Redwire too besides the others, but decided to focus on RKLB for the time being.; Why are there rational analysis on my gambling sub?; If you see it on WSB, chances are, you’re too late. You’ll be exist liquidity.; I have 500 shares (I’m poor).  It’s doing well tho; Dam I think I missed this one; I sold my 1 call too soon, oh well, may my 10 shares fly high...; Been holding rdw for 6 months, was never allowed to post about it and stopped trying; Why didn't you include Q3 revenue from RKLB?

Looks like you're hiding some valuable information in the DD to make RDW look better..; What’s with the space stocks this last year; I’m regretting the covered calls at $17 I sold last week…; So it sounds like they have their toes in a large number of small add-ons and accessories for space missions.  Do they have any particular products or tech that is likely to scale up over the next few years?; What would the move be for calls?; As soon as it even gets volume and more price action to matter, they’ll just dilute shares to raise capital and rug retail. Fuck that.; Juicy; Have you made a posts about this stock before? I jumped on this when it was around $3 so if that was you thanks!; Sounds like the pitch for Aerotyne Industries lol; Great post; Looking at the daily 5 year chart...oof; So now all of you depressed fontanelle people are going to start talking about it?; These stocks are gonna be the worst performers next year when reality hits; Thanks for the heads up; Interesting stuff! Thanks for sharing; Up 10% today nice; just in time to buy, so we can buy in high and sell when it'll crash; I just wanna invest in Spinlaunch bruh, fuck everybody else. Fuck rockets, we're going trebuchet power to launch satellites baby.; So this usually means I should buy puts.; https://preview.redd.it/0dbxrzjzjv9e1.gif?width=498&format=png8&s=d59118f630068e356ad144e68279c8181e98bb6c; Lost money on this in 2021 buying 2022 $10 leaps and sold my 100 shares I had. Had 100 $10 calls expire may 2022 worthless lol.; Thanks for your detailed post. I too own a modest position in RDW but had a question for you: any thoughts on some of their investors executing warrants that were issued over the last months/years? Do you feel like this would dilute the stock and cause a major contraction?

Additionally, what is the price point you are thinking 6 months from now?; Counter DD, when bots push pump and dumps, they often reply to their own comments repeatedly. Lmfao.; Blame WSB not me I tried posting this in October and they wouldn’t let me lmao then tried again twice in November. I’ve been trying to get y’all on the wave but WSB is the one that’s refused to let me. No pump and dump here just an opportunity that’s been completely disregarded compared to its peers yet is primed for growth especially with its volume and float; ""Room to run!"" WSB; A lot of people including me have been screaming RDW for months now; That’s my two cents here I’ve owned all of the others and still dabble but personally think RDW RKLB are the 2 to own for the next 5/10/20yrs+; Bitch you were the one that was wrong!; Yeah I sold all of mine at 2.5 lol didn’t see this coming (still made 5x). Given that, how does this possibly have a larger market cap than RDW lol I need someone to explain cause they just got out of NASDAQ jail and all the sudden they buy some bitcoin and they’re a 1b company? Not denying their battery technology but just don’t see how it’s more valuable than RDW considering what they’ve done/accomplished; What is KULR before I yolo; I bought 40k shares at .40 and sold at a loss when it dipped to .32 lmfao. Missed out on 120kish gains biggest mistake of the year.

Fortunately got in ASTS, LUNR, RKLB, IONQ, RGTI, RCAT, and some other shit 6 months ago, so I'm still up a couple 6 figures, but what an absolute FUMBLE to sell something for a LOSS that was literally weeks away from a 6 figure gain lmao.; Palladyne ai is up 60%; Bullish Af on KULR; I’m super bullish on ASTS. They’re one I’m accumulating to hold for 3+ years; seems like they’re still waiting on some type of approval for more testing.; I just took my profits on that. Figured 200% on a WSB was good enough to walk away with; Sitting on a nice +581% return from $RKLB with 500 shares. But I can’t decide if I should git while the gittin’s good or hold forever until they’re doing SpaceX launch volume and printing money; Yeah I mean i thought that about sound achr rcat lunr but look what happened; Where should I look to *not* be late?; It’s still early lol look at its multiple vs all of the other ones … currently trading 3x which is far below what LUNR ASTS KULR RKLB are trading at. 

Volume is under 700k avg vs 10M+ LUNR RKLB ASTS KULR 

Float is 1/10 of the others

This one hasn’t even been noticed yet…; Same; Yeah it’s crazy right? I was gonna stop but every time I see more good news and the volume trickles up a little but remains 1/10 that of any of the other space stocks even virgin galactic. I’m just like fuck how is no one on this yet so had to keep trying. This is a real gem over some of the other space meme stocks we’re seeing pop off (respect making money on them - I’m doing the same).; I wrote this originally before Q3 numbers came out I’ve been trying to post this literally since October 14th. Took me a few hours to compile all of it and really didn’t feel like going back to add more time lol

I’m definitely not here saying it should be valued the same as RKLB nor that you should sell any rklb to own RDW. I’m simply saying that while all other space stocks have had that run up and market attention and volume push, RDW fails to have it which puts it in a position to have the same thing happen to it that occurred for the others. That’s all - catch up time; He also stripped out 2024 guidance for RKLB and LUNR, both are growing at a far faster pace than RDW and they face less competition. His post is very frustrating as it misses loads of key facts about Redwire, a bullish factor is the significant increase in contract bidding ; Market catching up to the opportunity it presents; Nah. I read about Rocketlab when it was at $4 here on WSB.; SpaceX has drawn a ton of hype to the sector.; Its just a pump hype. Remember when it was COVID stocks? Then SPAC stocks? Then AI stocks? Currentyly the hype is Quantum  and space stocks.  I dunno what the next hype will be...; VLEO, space based manufacturing + pharma are the 2 I’m most excited about but they do have their fingers in a ton of other critical infrastructure for space; Look at the roll out solar arrays, they are on the ISS and more are being made for all satellites and spacecraft!; I’ll be completely honest I am not an options kinda guy I dabble but I’m certainly no expert I buy long and below where I know it’ll be (with pretty close to certainty or rather I’d be shocked if it wasn’t) in the money so I’m in on $4C for next May but planning to buy 2026 when they come out. Only let you buy up to Aug 2025 as of now; If that happens it’s the perfect time to buy! I loaded up at the $11/12 LUNR dip after they diluted.; 🫡; Don’t say “you” as if I fall into the “I only make investments into hyped stocks” category. I’ve owned this one for over 2 years. Just looking at other things here that have taken off recently and RDW has more consistent revenue, growth, and history than any of them minus RKLB

ASTS, LUNR, now even KULR has a larger market cap lmao

I’ve traded all of the above but they’re more hype than sound imo. I view it as RDW and RKLB are the picks and shovels for the space industry; Wait till neutron launch happens and Trump takes office with Elon on his side barking at him to give space a fat chunk of change that’s taken away from NASA and redistributed to the companies actually doing things. Space force was started in his last term and he’s been big saying “we’re going to get to mars”. Not to mention hypersonic missiles and the satellite race occurring before our eyes (Starlink, ASTS, GSAT, the EU now, etc etc). I see no reason this slows down I actually think it accelerates; how do I save this; I’m just active my man lol; He is pumping $RDW and $GSAT , your welcome.; Honestly this thing is up 400% this year on minimal volume … I personally think this one should be closer to 50-60 a share considering revenue numbers and growth; Which is subreddit is the best alternative without such strict moderation; Then what’s the next big thing?; Let us know next timee; Why did you you just DM us????; Yeah I bought in on 5 September after reading lots of comments about it on WSB. People complaining about not seeing it before are just incapable of reading.; Thx for the DD. 

I was curious why you chose to sell your LUNR. What makes it less worthy of holding than, say, RKLB, in your view? (I have some of each).; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787); Call your AI chatgpt lawyer!; I think $KULR is ripping on the breadth of the potential market with battery tech advancing across sectors. They do not yet have the revenue to back this up, but the groundwork of the partnerships seems to be there. I'm intrigued by $RDW going to have a look.; Just yolo on KULR. I got in at .40 cents back in November and now they are up to $4.55. It’s sustainable battery energy management. They have some huge government contracts, space contracts, as well as other major companies.; Carbon fiber stuff.  Took forever to get moving. When this was a penny stock, I  thought about it.  I completely missed it; Another pump and dump stock. You may get lucky if you buy it during pump.; Scam stock but has active volume. Not a long term hold yolo.; Look at your total gain/loss.

It’s easy to get caught up in thinking like this. 

If you’re way up overall, you’re doing great!; My 1/17 calls are up 500% I’m still greeding; I am on just over 200% since July this year, which maybe my best investment yet. I am kinda hoping there will be some drastic correction so I dont increase my average price when I continue to buy more next month.; Cannot win them all. I used to chase, now just stick to 8 stocks I like and only that.; What do you like? Technology? Clothes? Stick with what you know, when you see an opportunity, buy. Then you post on WSB lol.; Nice call bro; 3x multiple of what?; Okay i understand what you're trying to say. Thanks for the DD bro, looks like WSB should've given you green light last time!; Yeah I got in on RKLB and ASTS early based on DD here, I’m just unsure about if the space stocks are just riding the public curtails now or if there’s legit future; I’m also in on RKLB $2C Jan 2026 and $7C Jan 2027; So do you think the boat has sailed for calls?; Lmk what I need to do to prove I’m not a bot😂😂😭; I genuinely don't care what trash they're shilling out.     
     
I just downvote, call out their BS, and move on.; Idk I can’t post anything either. It’s like Fort Knox; LODE; IONQ 😉; ?; They want it all on a silver platter; Not here to say LUNR won’t be worth more than it is today in the future because I do believe it will be but I watched it 3x in like 3 months so dipped it. Conviction with it isn’t there like RKLB and RDW for 2 reasons:

1) RDW and rklb have a history of action while LUNR (in my opinion) is still to be seen. Hope to see more action rather than hypotheticals and dreams. Yes they have great contracts but pay is dependent

2) picks and shovels vs the ones digging for gold. LUNR doesn’t exist without the RKLBs and RDWs of the world. I’d rather own the enablers so I’m longer on rklb and RDW potential.; I only text them, I don’t pay for voice credits; I think there’s a lot of social sentiment around $KULR right now as well.

They’re in the right place at the right time for a huge run right now
- they’re in space + batteries, two hot categories 
- they’re widely discussed online 
- the stock price is low (in dollars, not p/e), making it feel easy to buy
- lots of other small cap stocks ripping right now, people are looking for the next one 

Personally, I’m in for a few hundred shares around $3.25 average just for social/trend runup. 

I’m planning on selling a small percentage to get my initial investment back and letting the rest ride; I'm still too regarded to understand options. I just buy/sell shares.

I hope you win though.; Damn I just closed 1/3 calls when it hit the 19$ wall for 450%; P/S; The last 3 times lol; I mean not for nothing, it seems like you were really early on these. Seems like you know what you’re doing; Active is different than stupidly inefficient, mate.    
     
But, whatever, you do you. Enjoy pushing your P&D with your new alt.; I’m on the IONQ train, at 307% so far. 

Also just bought into DAVE; GSAT 🚀; Didn’t this already make a big move ? Ofc it can con still go higher . I’m a noob on Quantum computing but I’ll do my DD soon .; Pass; Should've messaged us privately.; Sometimes you just have to take your winnings you know? My gut tells me RDW and rklb are for the long haul 20-50x at least what they both sit at today. LUNR my gut is mixed, up in the air. Could 20-50x for sure but also like idk maybe it doesn’t. Not here to say the risk isn’t present with RDW or rklb because it certainly is there but I think a 20x on both of them is a “worst case scenario” like I truly can’t imagine either of them going to zero while LUNR again my gut says “idk”. Again I am not the type of trader to look at technicals all that much. Yes it’s important and yes it was clear there was a consolidation period for all stocks in this sector for 2-3yrs so run up was due to happen but I know what I like and what I’m interested in and being interested makes me dive really deep in on one thing or another. Space is one of these things and I don’t have the sound conviction i have with other players in the space. $GSAT is another I love right now. Massive consolidation, awesome news, $1.5B from Apple (including equity stake) and tons of insider buying this past week. Still holding the 2 range. LT Apple will make a play for the satellite space and gsat was who they picked to “win the battle” or at least power all of Apple; Checkout MVST, its battery tech and their Q3 earnings looked good. I have about 500 shares at $1 _average, it’s been riding the KULR wave.; I’ll explain (I’m regarded also) 

You buy the option to buy 100 shares at that price in the future. So now when the price goes up $1 it goes up $100 or whatever as a percent of your option. 

You dont have to actually buy all the 100 shares bc you can sell it when it’s up in value


I am not a financial advisor; The way options clicked for me was this analogy: You want to enter in an auction, the entry fee (premium) in the pre-auction area is 100 dollars at this moment of the time, and you buy the ticket from another person (call seller - who realized he doesn't need to buy anything at the auction.)

Now as you hang around the place, you also come to realize that there isn't anything of interest to buy there; you decide not to participate in the auction, and so you go outside to sell your ticket but now suddenly, you sell it for 300 dollars. 

Why? because the auction became far more popular by the time you hanged around there and now there are more people who want to buy your entrance ticket at a higher price (premium).

So you sell this ticket for 300, which gave you a profit of 200 dollars. That's how ""not exercising"", or better said selling call options work; you paid a premium for the right to buy 100 shares by a certain time at a certain price, and if that price becomes reality, more people want to buy that option and so the premium increases, so you sell ""that right to own 100 shares to someone else for a higher premium than what you paid for it"".; Still a win; I just finished researching them and looking at their financials. Amazing find! I am grateful for you
Could you tell me how did you find it over 2 years ago?; I just know certain verticals/industries really really well cause im hella interested in them and i bet on the horse(s) i think are gonna win 2/5/10 years out; Why gsat?; Is that the ticker?; Who is us lol I don’t know what you’re talking about; on RDW, most of the gainers this year have action in the penny stock subs, not this sub. 

GSAT is already 4bil market cap while negative EPS. how much upside is there?; Thanks for your responses.; I’ll check it out!; because he can't afford ASTS; Look at the chart; The entire sub. You could've messaged us privately; I didn’t message anyone bro idk what the hell you’re on about; Downvote this clown ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258); I believe he’s trying to say that since you couldn’t post back in October, you should have somehow messaged everyone on the sub instead lol; I'm saying you should've thought. Should've messaged us all individually; Ah I see yeah sounds reasonable🫠😂😂"

After they retired the 13% 2029 Senior debt of $219MM,  they only have $175MM debt remaining.  As of 9/30/24, they had assets of $917MM.  

That's a 5:1 asset-to-debt ratio, VERY strong, especially for a capital intensive business!!; Globalstar will retire me; I di believe this is good for both business and clients. it’s creating a stronger network able to help customer. I hope this company gets it together in their product department and starts coming out with some groundbreaking innovations.; Globalstar $gsat debt update.

As of September 30, 2024, Globalstar reported total debt of approximately $394.4 million, with $34.6 million short-term and $359.8 million long-term debt. 

In November 2024, Globalstar announced an expanded agreement with Apple, which includes a prepayment of up to $1.1 billion for infrastructure and funds to retire Globalstar's 13% senior notes due 2029. 

Globalstar's 13% Senior Notes due 2029 have an outstanding principal amount of $219 million.  The total amount required for the debt retirement is approximately $232 million, including an additional $13 million in make-whole fees.

Therefore, after retiring the 2029 Senior Notes, Globalstar would have $141 million LT debt remaining. Total debt would be $175 million.; SpaceX jumps in: ""the hell you are!""; So ASTS pointless yet?; Surveillance...; Is this gonna be another one of those things where theybinvest money into somrthing that eventually fails and thus have to fall back on somrthing that is alreadynproven to be stable such as Starlink?

2. So, you think your mobile carrier is better? 🤣; Even if it's a hundred dollars a month it would be great. Plenty of people are already paying that and if you can use your service world wide it would be amazing.

You have no idea what you are talking about. 


$GSAT sucks, they are having a reverse split next year. End of story. ; Fi provides access to terrestrial cellular towers by reselling T-mobile, and I may not be reading the room correctly, but I think folks are talking about space-based cellular. T-mo is working on this with Starlink / SpaceX, but resellers rarely get the latest offerings. ASTS is also working to provide direct-to-cell global coverage. 

Globalstar probably wants to provide this service, but currently they require another device - a sat phone / rather than using your existing cell phone.; Google Fi is pretty great but they’re buggy at times. I’ve had to call support multiple times because my data just up and quit until I reinstalled everything; In theory, the next little while will see satellite internet service as if your typical cell phone tower has now been launched into orbit. Everything else is the same. The signal, the speed, except now with nearly limitless range.

But so far with apple and globalstar, the service is fairly minimal and requires specialized satellite receptive hardware (iPhone 15 and newer) rather than using your existing cell phone.

So when the newer, better networks get up and running, and as long you can afford it (might be costly at first), you should be able to receive a sat. signal on even ancient phones, apple, android, or whatever. So you can imagine the broad appeal this will generate. No more dead zone as you drive down dangerous highways. No more need for a brand new phone either.

In fact, it may even render apple’s venture with globalstar entirely obsolete. The deciding factor will be cost (until the market matures).; Ikr! If they could fit it in a iPhone, I don’t see why they couldn’t fit it in a MacBook or a iPad. Imagine the day you no longer need to pay outrageous data rates while travelling. 

I would switch over to Mac instantly for this.; 1. They sell meta data, not your encrypted data. Hi I did work for top3 companies in the adverse.
2. Mobile carriers can't sell your data in Europe, aapl are trying to circumvent it.
3. You're an idiot.; I remember being a horny little kid and texting some chick out in Cali when I first got a phone. (I’m all the way on the east coast.) Bill came out to like $600. My mom cancelled that shit right away; I’m up over 1000% on KULR.

"NVIDIA's $30 billion net retail buy-in in 2024 and when NVIDIA's market cap will overtake Apple's with the rise of artificial intelligence

","Retail investors bought nearly $30 billion of NVIDIA stock this year through Dec. 17, making it the company with the largest retail inflow this year, according to Vanda research data. That's nearly twice as much as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), a large-cap U.S. stock ETF, and is on track to overtake Tesla, which will be “Retail's Favorite Stock” in 2023

https://preview.redd.it/dui8qh7dc79e1.jpg?width=353&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=131be4eca17c3e1afa52c8f3b230213598115518

Marco Iachini, senior vice president of research at Vanda, said, “NVIDIA's stock price has risen so spectacularly that it has stolen the limelight from Tesla.”



　　



NVIDIA has been favored by investors large and small over the past year or so. Last month, NVIDIA officially joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average and was the top performer among the index's 30 components. Despite slightly volatile trading in December, NVIDIA is still on track to realize a gain of more than 180% by the end of 2024. Today, its market capitalization has surpassed $3 trillion, making it the second-largest U.S. company by market capitalization, behind Apple.



　　



NVIDIA's retail investor position has also increased significantly. According to Vanda's data, NVIDIA's weighting in retail portfolios has risen from 5.5% earlier this year to more than 10%. Currently, NVIDIA is the second-largest position for retail investors, behind Tesla. This year, net inflows of retail money into NVIDIA are up more than 885% from three years ago.

**Ticker:** NVDA

**Direction:** Up

**Prognosis:**  Buy and Hold (Seems to be the retail investor strategy)

**Market Cap Note:**  Soon to surpass Apple.

**Retail Investor Sentiment:**  Extremely bullish;  ~$30B net buy-in in 2024,  outpacing even SPY.  NVDA is now the second largest position in retail portfolios.; So…do the opposite?; So new highs after christmas? 🥰; LUNR is on fire now; We're 2 years into the AI boom, I think this bitch has another 5 years left in the tank before people start realizing it's not going to take humans to valhalla; Retail investors had $30 billion to gamble?

NVDA's got that AI monopoly locked down tight. [AI agents dropping in 2025](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/from-microsoft-to-nvidia-the-ai-agents-are-coming-in-2025-141314094.html). Gonna make bank. 

Retail knows what's up. $30B buy-in this year wasn't dumb money. Was smart money. 

TLDR: NVDA 🚀🚀🚀; Selling all my Nvda at this point and moving it to Intel.; I see NVDA, I downvote. Fk you and shit stock.; Yes, NDVA is dead money now.  Do as I say.; But why; The AI we currently have access to is the most rudimentary, 0.1 of human civilization; So Puts?; Retail Christmas spend up 6% yoy. Brokies just yell about it lol; Lol AAPL makes more revenue from services alone than the whole of NVDA.; They have been flat for 28 years… goodluck lmao; Guess you don’t like money.; Put your money where your mouth is and buy some puts.;  Awarded 5 billion nasa contract also added to aerospace and defense fund; People constantly ignore this, we are in the Mosaic/Netscape stage of AI not in the iPhone 16 Pro stage. Impressive as it may be this is still infant technology.; r/aliens; Too early.; Logic and fundamentals have no place in this market my sweet summer child.; Exactly. It’s frustrating how true this is. It was painful, looking at that chart of the top gainers for the year.; And Walmart makes damn near double the revenue as AAPL. That makes them a better buy?

It’s the net income that matters, regard. Look up NVDA’s profits compared to Apple’s, especially 2025 estimates — and NVDA’s growing cash pile which is expected to hit $200B by 2026, then come back and report. And don’t forget the fucking fries; They don’t have any money they didn’t buy NVDA 😂; Oh neat, I knew I got some for a reason; Still god to buy now? I’m a ~beary~ mood; The biggest question that will determine what happens with AI is if we can continue to grow the compute necessary to advance it. AI is quickly running up against our compute limits of silicon tech, and quantum computing is still trapped in its infancy. The question is if the AI ""hotness"" will cool off before quantum computing catches up. We might have another generation of AI LLMs before we hit limits of compute that we can throw at it without the services being so insanely overpriced that no-one will buy them. o3 is likely that limit, as looking at the pricing for o1, we're already hitting limits of what I'm seeing my customer's budgets would stretch for. And those customers are some of the biggest fortune 500 med-tech, fin-tech, and manufacturing companies in the world. If o3 can't fit in those budgets, we're likely to see advancement slow in 2025 dramatically until compute costs can catch up. If we don't see a breakthrough in multi-qubit systems in 2025, we likely won't see AGI until 2030 or beyond. If there is a major multi-qubit compute breakthrough in 2025, we could see AGI by 2030.

Though all of this is speculation and just based on my understanding of the challenges that NVIDIA and others are running into making AI accelerators on the existing 3nm silicon nodes and upcoming 2nm nodes. There's a huge problem that silicon-based transistors are running up against called quantum tunnelling. It's what's causing the cost of silicon chips to dramatically rise as the yields at the sizes we're working at now are so low, and the costs to produce each chip are higher as well, since these chips need to use more and more of the die footprint as they're getting larger instead of smaller to add more compute. If we can't overcome quantum tunneling with a swap to a new material, or a change in the transistor architecture, we're likely to see the theoretical die-shrinkage limits of silicon based transistors in the 2nm or 18A fab processes in 2025/2026. That means either chips will continue to grow in size, causing costs to continue to rise, or we'll stagnate in generational compute growth. Just think, the 4090 is 608.5mm\^2 with about 76 Billion transistors. The 3090 was 628mm\^2 with about 28 Billion transistors, and the Titan RTX was 754mm with only 18.6 Billion transistors. We've relied on generational die shrinkage to increase both transistor count, and shrink the transistor-per-millimeter count in order to increase compute. Rumors are that the 5090 die size is 744mm\^2. That's a bad sign. It's likely that they weren't able to get 120+ Billion Transistors or more in the 600mm\^2 that we're likely to see in the 5090. This is all based on speculation around the rumored specs. I'd wager the 5090 will come in right around 125-130 Billion Transistors. If they are only able to cram 130 Billion transistors in 744mm\^2, that means that we're going to see a huge slowing of generational compute increases on silicon until there's some tech breakthrough. The 5090 is supposed to be on the newer 3nm node from TSMC, as Samsung doesn't have a node that can cram 120+ Billion transistors into a 700mm\^2 die right now. If 2nm doesn't put 200+ Billion transistors in a 500mm\^2 die, then compute is going to either get large again, which leads to much more expensive chips, or we're going to see a slowing down of compute increases.; Market is pricing in apple 16 pro stage when it has almost 0 uses right now

What's the price going to be when it hits apple 16 pro stage? 20 quadrillion?; Great nuance and point - totally lost on most.; Not necessarily. We are much closer to the physical limits of computer technology now than we were in the '90s. It's always possible that some innovation will push the bar further, but it's yet to be seen.; The market is forward trading so we are anticipating the iphone stage. For nvidia and AI companies to explode more, we need to see the equivalent of AI destroying labor markets.

Which it can hit. Just be aware this is what your betting on/against, not this current AI.; Did I ever say aapl was the better buy? I was just replying to the top commenter on his dumb take that Nvda should have the bigger cap than aapl. 

You talk about net income lmfao and aapl makes almost 4x the net income of Nvda. U think Nvdas gross profit margin is gonna stay at 70% for any longer? Keep dreaming. 

Fucking dumbass pack the fries yourself bruh; >  Walmart has actually been a better buy; Yes. When they announce lift off date for lander, which is within weeks. Check out some great DD on intuitive machines Reddit; https://preview.redd.it/vekaok7nu79e1.jpeg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a195d0dda391257eb94d539a85fdebe6613dbfd; This seems more like summarizing what you think you read on tech articles rather than any actual personal opinion/analysis. ; Except things like active inference is being developed that shows potential to have better AI capabilities with a 100th of the compute power. 

Verses.ai; Thanks for that! Do you have any opinion on ASML's growth regarding this?; >0 uses; >What's the price going to be when it hits apple 16 pro stage? 20 quadrillion?

I would take that, tbh.; thank you; AAPL 2024 net income: $93.74B
NVDA 2024 net income: $29.76B

Keep in mind, AAPLs net profit has been declining the last four quarters, pretty significantly. 

NVDA’s is growing. Add in the annual variance with Rubin coming, and yeah, 70% will be maintained.; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)

Remindme! 1 year; Dude wrote a bible on a gambling subreddit; ASML makes the machines that the fabs use. They have some of the world’s best semiconductor scientists working on these problems. But a competitor could just as well make the missing breakthrough that puts them on their back foot. It’s a race, and ASML has an edge, but an edge doesn’t guarantee a win.; appreciate it tho; lol, early morning coffee rant. Gotta love when your brain just gets away from ya."
Investing 10K USD Suggestions,"I am 27. I was thinking of buying a house in the near future, and wanted to build up my down payment. Let’s saw my goal is 100k. Or is that too high?

So for context.

I invested $3k into GME when it was like $36 back in march or April of 2021. I guess I do regret not selling when it hit 310, but I’ve held onto it cause why not. And it’s sitting at about 10k. I guess there was a stock split because I thought I was in the red at $32 but I seem to have more than tripled my value.

On top of that I had $15k in cash I wanted to invest so for the time being I bought like $500-1200 worth of Intel, AMD, Nvidia, Apple, SPY, and DOW.

I have 10k cash left.

I don’t know if I should just keep it in my Apple savings at 3.8%, or shove it into Nvidia, or Apple, or SPY or one of Schwab’s options.

Any suggestions are welcome.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hmhpjr/investing_10k_usd_suggestions/,5,2024-12-26 06:26:11,"All i can say is that you have your expectations way, way, way off. Last couple of years ‘the magnificent 7’ stocks (google them) did pretty good but this is not something you may expect every year. For a diversified portfolio you can hope for an average of 9-10% a year. So if you invest 10k next year you have 11k. Thats it. If you want to buy a house within 5-10 years i would advise against investing at all especially if you think going from 10k to even 30k is an easy task. Please don’t go broke on all the social media guru’s bs advice.; 10k into short dated call options should get you there; If you’re planning on buying a home “in the near future” then investing in equities may not be the most appropriate option. Equities are a highly volatile and risky asset to hold short-term regardless of diversification, which you seriously lack. Meaning there remains a solid possibility your portfolio could go down and take many YEARS to recover. 

Investing is a long-term game. I wouldn’t buy equities I didn’t plan to hold for at least 7-10 years (although some may recommend closer to 5 years as a minimum). 

An alternative option for the short-term would be piling your money into USFR/TFLO, SGOV, or a MMF all of which will give you a greater return than your Apple savings account plus greater state tax efficiency.; Like you I proudly wear my ‘GME 2021 Short Squeeze’ service medal with pride and retain one share in GME so that I hopefully never forget such interesting times for retail investor power.

If you are thinking of buying a house in the ‘near future’ the stock market may not be the best place for the cash as it could end up tied up in a stock for some time depending upon how it all pans out.

That said, if you can afford to speculate (and possibly lose money or leave it tied up for a while) then there are many opportunities out there. I don’t give stock specific suggestions but my new r/DoubleBubbler sub may give some ideas.; Is there an index fund that tracks the magnificent 7?; Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.

Go back 10 or 20 years ago to see what the equivalent “magnificent 7” were back then. In 2004 you would have invested in the then top company, General Electric."
Do you use margin and if so how much?,"Margin is such an interesting subject. If the interest rate of a margin loan is below the average return of the S&P500 it seems smart to use at least some margin. Obviously not an amount that quickly eats away at the underlying capital but a conservative amount like 10-20% seems like a very easy way to pad a portfolio. 

I know there is also a popular ‘rich people’ strategy of buy, borrow, and die so that you never have to face the capital gains tax and can get a solid step up basis for the next generation. But even beyond that it seems smart if you are simply using the margin funds to buy more of the underlying asset, especially with the tax advantages that come with it. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hmgag4/do_you_use_margin_and_if_so_how_much/,26,2024-12-26 04:57:15,"No. I only used it once to buy a car in full. That was back when margin rates were 2.25% and car loans were 6-7%. I paid off the margin loan when rates started going up. I never use margin to invest because that is how people blow up their portfolios.; No I’ve heard margarine is dangerous so I’ve gone to full butter; On my brokerage the current margin loan rate is significantly higher than the avg S&P return unless you're rich. If we stay in this crazy bull market then yeah, it's worth it. That's not guaranteed though.

I'd avoid using margin loans except on a short-term temporary basis, to bet on this bull market you're better off putting the money you'd spend on margin loan interest into a leveraged ETF instead - no risk of margin calls and while with its own upsides and downsides the cost of the leverage via ETF is much cheaper.; No. I used it once amd got burned, to each their own though.  If it works out, don't assume it will always work out; Up to 50% but very short term.
Unless I need a short term loan to buy a house or something. Then I tap into it also. Dirt cheap at IBKR.; Using to level up my dividend account.  Use to buy on ex-date, use only 50% of what I get in dividends the following month, so it is always paid off within 10-20 days. This way I get the deal on the etf I want and grows the monthly dividends each month.  Plus the interest expense is tax deductible as I itemize.; I don't. It always struck me as extremely risky.; I just think of it as another line of credit if I ever need one. It tends to have a lower interest rate than other loans, doesn't have a payback schedule, and isn't reported. For those reasons, it's pretty high on the list in situations where I want to borrow. 


I've never used it to invest. ; I'm a gambler.  I know my limits and being on margin is not one of them.  Fuck that jazz.  I'd ruin myself and family.; It's on in the brokerages, only to allow a buy of something if an opportunity arises without having to raise and transfer funds to be able to get it.  Day or two later all is settled in the green.; I use margin. Everything is held in margin (i.e., not cash). That way, when I sell, I don't have to wait to settle. I never pay interest and can not be margin called so long as my settled cash is always >= 0. Also, margin is required to short sell.; I have only used margin as a way to take cash out of my portfolio without selling stocks.; If I have money in another account or securities I'm unloading and I want to buy right away? Absolutely 


As a long term strategy never. Even back in 2020 the margin rate was 3%, now I believe the lowest is around 8%. That is well above the risk free rate.; Had a few repairs needed for the house that came out of nowhere. Totaled around 10k. CC interest rate is around 20% and margin is half of that. So I withdrew against my brokerage account; I buy rental properties with mine then have the cash flow pay it off; I use it when I see a clear and obvious buying opportunity. Never more than that. LUNR took a massive unwarranted dump from $16 to $11 ish. I scooped up a bunch at $11 and am almost up 50%. 

Now this doesn’t always work. But I’ve found it works best for me, and I don’t get caught holding a margin position for way too long that way.; I use margin for short term liquidity but don't use more than I could cover if the equities backing it were to go to zero. I also use it to sell naked puts when buying stocks, but this is extremely risky and again, I only use what I could cover from other funds if I was assigned everything and only on securities I'm actively trying to acquire. I wouldn't use margin to purchase but/hold securities unless it was a small amount that you could cover from something else.

You are totally right that margin is interesting and you can absolutely get a better return on capital by using it. However, if you are reckless you can easily lose a crazy amount of money.; I had 100k a few months ago and used margin. The account is currently at 1.4Million; I use a large portion of the margin available to me. The larger my portfolio, the more comfortable I am using some margin. I just sure my portfolio can absorb any significant corrections so that I don't get margin called. I should mention that I'm also single so I'm probably more risk-on than most.; I thought about using margin for short options on ibkr but their calculation of the margin impact is incredible intransparent. I made a python script to simulate the margin impact and compared all available strike prices for the next year. The maintenance margin changes a lot during the year. In some cases from 20% to 80% upon closer expiration (even far otm). Thats far to risky for me.; Yes, on my dividend account. Typically around 200%. I don’t use it on any other accounts, but I will buy an etf that uses up to 25%.; I used margin to pay for a operation I needed on my head, kept all my investments in tact. I think it’s worth it in situations like that, has been 4 months and I’ve only gained about $130 in interest; I suggest you read the 2007 Mortgage Your Retirement horror story over on Bogleheads. 

https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5934; I'll be swapping to margin use to pay for expenses and keep income levels low for tax advantages, ACA benefits ( by keeping reportable income low), and convert trad to ROTH more heavily each year.  I figure the 4-5% outperforms the minimum 10% tax on trad IRA in the long run.; No; No.; I do not use margin, but I do have some Closed End Funds (CEF) that use leverage.  My reasoning being that they can borrow at much better rates than I can.  This also lets me keep the leveraged part of my portfolio firewalled from the responsible parts.; In my Japanese portfolio I use 20-30% margin because the interest rates are very low. Generally I'm very wary of margin and only use it for transactional float.; Leveraged ETFs; I park Robinhood’s 1K margin into SGOV. Set my limit to $999.99. Combined with the Roth 3% match it’s essentially free money as the margin is at 0% interest.; I don't do hard drugs; I have one portfolio that's modestly geared (35%), and my holdings need to drop about 50% before I have to worry about margin calls. The interest I pay is tax deductible and my provider also contributes to my frequent flyer program.; You can use margin in a variety of ways. It's not always just to borrow to buy more securities. 

IMO - the more interestingly related subject is leverage and how to efficiently use it and manage risk.; If you ask yourself the question ""If using margin to buy assets is so smart, why aren't the banks using their money to buy assets instead of lending ~~a sucker~~ you money for a theoretically smaller but guaranteed return"" then the answer is obvious.; My recent trade get 15% returns, then I start to use margin. I lost all the gains in two days. Will never use it for investing.; I can’t believe it; Vegetable oils are actually better for you than animal fats.; How'd you get burned? Invested in a single stock and it tanked?; They let you withdraw margin?!?; Which stock/ETF?; Yup. Brokerages offer it because it makes them money.; Same. I leave overly optimistic buy orders open on certain stocks. If there's the random piece of bad news that sparks a panic, like the McDonald's e. Coli thing a few months ago, I'll grab a bit of the stock at a good price and either transfer in some cash, sell off an index fund that didn't similarly plunge to cover it, or sell it for an almost immediate profit.

But I never let margin debt sit for more than a day or two.; What happens in a recession when your renters can't make their payments?; There’s regulations preventing banks from doing that; Regionals and smaller banks do this. They lend money to local businesses and developers using the money they get from deposits. Then, they quickly create a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to buy those loans off their balance sheets and handle them for investors as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). The period between giving out the loans and setting up the SPV to take them off their books is their margin loan.; You don’t need for it to tank you are actively accruing interest; This was 2 decades ago; Yes. What you use the money for does not matter as long as you keep the requirements.; Of course as long as you have enough collateral in your account to cover it; Here is my dividend portfolio I posted awhile ago, been adding steadily since tho

https://www.reddit.com/r/dividendgang/s/rMHc1wvKJP

Here is my watchlist, only buy when the price is below the 12 week median, plus I have a few other criteria I have set up on the tracker.

https://www.reddit.com/r/dividendgang/s/GNgNNKSa6w; And since your stock is somewhat used to guarantee their loan to you it's a lower risk for higher reward for them.

I always wonder if Murphy is watching.; Then I would stop paying off the margin loan until I refill the unit. My day job can cover the mortgages no problem. My job is recession proof; My meta-point is that the reason the brokerages offer margin is because it's profitable for them, not because it's good for you. Leverage amplifies gains when you win, and amplifies losses when you lose. I'm not gonna say you should *never* use it, but if you *need* to use it you probably shouldn't. A bad year with a cash portfolio hurts. A bad year with a heavily margined portfolio is ruin.; Big difference because their loans are secured, whereas your YOLO into Bob's School Of Culinary Design And Auto Repair is not.; At this point the interest is only 5.75%-7% on many major brokerages. I end up paying like a few cents a day. If you can't outpace a few cents a day you need to rethink your strategy.; Interesting, thanks.; Ok but when banks could use your money to trade stocks they did trade your money to trade stocks; Not all are Asset-Based Loans (ABLs), most are trade finance loans.; Historically the SP rate of return is about 9-10%. Taking a loan at 6-7% and hoping for 9.5% isn't exactly fail proof. 

If your underlying securities drop in value your brokerage will sell those on your behalf to cover your margin, they're not going to give you a few months to see if your stocks recover.; Try running that scenario between 2000 and 2010.; Not at all saying it's fail proof, but the downvotes are odd. If you think you have a strategy that can outpace the margin rate, I see absolutely no reason not to do it. If you can't, skip it. The point in my original comment is that if you're LOSING money on margin, it's pointless to use."

[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse); It is pretty funny that Apple got fucked the most out of the Google anti trust; What is that a 20% drop in their EPS if the DoJ wins?; Google EPS will improve if Apple can’t charge money for browser defaults. Most users will choose Google anyways.; Mother of pearl. Time to buy goog calls; game on apple just threw some shade at the feds good luck with that; As a shareholder in both companies yayyyy; It would be pretty great if the DOJ kills this payment.  Google clearly doesn’t need it — they got rid of defaults in the EU already and it was fine, not even newsworthy 

Apple needs it tho.  I think that’s why Google still pays it.  To maintain peace; The best solution.

DOJ just slaps a $500m fine on google and calls it quit.

Tells them to do better and help other companies in open source. 

It's on the best interest of DOJ aswell because they won't be winning this current case against them.; Is that AAPLs music I hear?; When 90% of the browser market uses Chrome or version of Chroimum. That makes Google the God emperor, judge, jury and executioner of all things internet, W3C open internet standards be damned.

Yes Google hasn't exploited their monopoly browser market yet but that's like expecting the fox to guard the hen house.; the trump administration loves to roll back regulations. Will this have any future bearing?; https://preview.redd.it/59hq72b9o39e1.jpeg?width=2124&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8b4b22712cce7054d590d3473f6fee4868417f89; All my fresh linux installs come with firefox though!; Google search has got so much worse, and its auto-correcting garbage I didn’t want entered into the search box in the first place. Google is hot garbage lately. Cant wait for OpenAi search to take over as default.; Actually Mozilla got fucked the most. Firefox would die without Google and Mozilla's only source of revenue has been their google search deal.

Ironic how an anti trust case on Google search is going to kill off one of the two remaining non-chromium browser lmao. Google Chromium is going to be the new web specifications.; Yep; I mean it's not like they just lose search, they'll make money off the divestment. it's just that the market doesn't like cash over earnings right; I thought Google pays Apple for that.

Google and competitors would pay Apple based on their search queries.; [deleted]; If google beats DOJ and they probably will.

This thing will RUN faster then Usain bolt to $3T; I'm seeing at least a 50% upside to the stock if Google can get out of it with minimal concessions.  It's already fairly under valued compared to its competitors by about that much.  Timing is the question, and whether or not calls are the right play given it could take some time. That said, it's been going up recently, so it might just be a good time to ride the wave.; The best solution is the new DOJ drops the whole case. 

It never made any sense, DOJ twisting themselves into a pretzel trying to find “remedies” for a non existent problem.; Why do you think all these tech executives are going down to Mar-a-Lago to kiss the ring? They’re trying to squash all these DOJ actions.; Mozilla also collects a huge amount of donations. They spend more money on lobbying/politics and grants than developing their browser. They recently acquired an advertisement business to make more money and simultaneously fired a huge portion of their developers. Unfortunately Mozilla decided there are more important things than Firefox.; Firefox has been declining in user count for years. They’ve been fucked and it’s not because of search deals.; There are others that don't use WebKit, ladybird is coming along there is also Servo for embedded. Both have funding outside google.; One of the results of the case is that Google will have to sell chrome and android.; Yeah that's one of the only issue I have with the lawsuit. It's fine if the court makes Google stop paying Apple, but the Firefox deal should stay.

As for making Google sell Chrome browser I am certain any other company rich enough to buy it will absolutely make it worse, The only one I trust which wouldn't is Steam, maybe Apple. Steam has an incentive to buy it because their store runs on Chrome.; [deleted]; As someone who makes software for browsers: good.; Europe requires people get to choose. Didn’t hurt Google’s bottom line.

Likely where we’re headed in the US.; Then how is  chrome is the most used browser on windows?

More directly to your point : they got rid of search engine defaults in the EU on Android phones in 2021 and nothing changed. There was a prompt screen and everyone picked G; At least in the EU I don’t think you are allowed to default it more. If you download a browser you are asked what you want your default search to be; Pichai already paid his respects to donnie at Mar-a-lago. It's all good now. LFGO!!; How long would it take for this case to come to verdict? Wouldn't this be like 3-5 years of grinding with DOJ seems far out?; This case w AAPL backing is a big deal; depends on how nicely Google plays with Trump; Seriously. People can change the default browser at any time.; Bullish; nowhere near the Google royalties though, that makes up 87% of their revenue; They're also spending a lot of their money on executives' salaries and DEI vacations.; Duckduck something ; Chromium not chrome; Steam runs off Chromium which is open source. Chrome being bought or sold does not directly effect what they can do there. Google does however do a lot of work on web standards and maintaining Chromium so it could hurt development there.

Loads of companies use Chromium. Electron apps are basically chromium browsers, things like Slack, Discord, Spotify for example.; Google employee here,

I use Firefox at work because Google-Chrome on my machine has to always be logged into my corp-employee-account. I don't wanna mix up personal stuff with work-browser-history. Before Chrome showed up, Firefox was great - and it still is for the most part if you don't bloat it with dozens of extensions.

Also... nobody wants to say it out loud, but Firefox's `__LACK__` of Chromecast functionality makes pr0n & spicy tiktok vids safer to watch. Nobody wants to accidentally cast their private fantasies to the livingroom where the family is. If Mozilla is smart, they will never add casting support to Firefox - or at least they'll hide it behind a bunch of ""about:config"" stuff.; Firefox is fantastic. Everything else is pretty much cheap makeup on a chromium pig.; It's good for mobile since you can actually use ublock origin on it.; Mozilla Firefox is the best. If you want a browser with adblock on your phone it's the best way.; It's literally better than chrome but unfortunately things like YouTube detect your not on chrome and make your experience worse; If you really think straying away from the W3C standards to some vendor specific nonsense like how it was back in the IE days is going to make your life easier, you are going to be surprised. It's already bad enough. We are at a point where we need a fucking toolkit to write a goddamn stylesheet that works on WebKit, Firefox and Chromium.

Google saved us from the explorer monopoly but they are going to become the new explorer in a hot minute.; All my passwords are saved in chrome and I don't feel like switching them to edge. ; Legacy. Chrome came out during a time when default window browser was terrible and everyone uses google products for the most part. Then Microsoft moved to edge and has its own suite. So, you stick with what you know works and download chrome. And that is for most who care.

If you don’t care, you just stick with what’s on your desktop. There js nothing inherently wrong with the Microsoft stack these days.; Safari on iOS has long had a lot more functionality than other browsers such as Apple Pay integration etc. so people usually stick with that as iOS browser default, and then Google comes as the default search engine within that browser

as for desktop browsers on Windows, the EU required Microsoft to offer multiple choices of default browsers upon installation (EU is similarly requiring Apple to offer choices of default browsers for iOS as well now), plus Internet Explorer was so shitty and lacking in functionality that people were moving to Firefox/Chrome in droves - that in turn made Firefox/Chrome the de facto standard for many web developers, so it created a feedback cycle where web developers would mostly focus on Firefox/Chrome standards/support = many sites were not compatible with Internet Explorer = more people download and use Chrome instead = more web developers focus on Firefox/Chrome and the cycle continues

same chicken-and-egg problem on why Windows Phone failed: everyone being on Android/iOS = tiny customer base for Windows Mobile app developers = no one makes apps for Windows Mobile = no one wants to buy a Windows phone and the cycle continues; And on the phone. He called trump to tell him the McDonald's stunt was #1 on search at the time.; Also, forgot to mention, I have 25 shares at $170 cost basis currently I plan to hold for pretty much till the end of time, however calls might be the play right now. I see a lot of potential upside in the short term, and reading into the DoJ case, it doesn't look likely Google gets broken up and moreso than they just change some of their practices.; Do you know how search works?; What in the Rightwing fuckery is this kind of comment?; huh? Chromium is open source and Google doesn't really 'own' it, browsers like Brave, Edge etc are branched off of Chromium. Google owns Chrome so he's correct (except I'm pretty sure it hasn't been confirmed that they have to sell off).; Hahaha let that be the one function i miss in Firefox, being able to cast to my screens. Chrome wouldnt even be installed anymore if Firefox had that.

Pro tip, you start the stream before you start the content 😂;  What about brave? Has pre installed ad block; Not if your phone runs iOS; The funny thing is Edge is built on the chromium engine which is the engine built for Chrome. This means even Microsoft admits it's a better engine.; Yea… if everything was just chromium life would be much simpler. Can’t tell you how many hours go into dealing with FF deficiencies.; This’s still not a good argument though. Are we going to hit every company that became a brand? 

You give people a choice. They pick for whatever reason. I don’t see a clear abuse here.; why are you expecting any different for search engine defaults then?

(also I disagree but curious to ⬆️ first); Will Apple be required to offer other actual browsers or will they still be safari with makeup? Because to me that seems way more monopolistic.; Pichai be like I'm with you way before the win please let me go this time 👉🏽🥺👈🏽; I'm not familiar with it but with Firefox you can have other extensions. If Braze also has that I'd say both are good.; Spoken like a true frontend webdev. Maybe if you stick to W3C you wouldn't have to spend hours. Firefox implements the standard well and sufficiently. You are probably relying on undefined behavior.; I mean, I want google to have chrome and Mozilla to have Firefox after this. 

I believe google handicapping itself By limiting the type and usage of data coming from chrome and android. The internet is very important for the survival of google and supporting a browser to ensure people to continue to use the internet is in their vested interest even if it doesn’t directly help their bottom line. Android is less important for data, but still is important to their bottom line. Google is a steward of the internet whether people like it or not. I would think every agency in the us regarding US national security doesnt want google not having android or chrome, or at the very least they need to be held by large, wealthy firms that can pour the money into them to ensure the applications are properly maintained for security reasons. 

With google on the chopping block, I was thinking nvidia should be on the chopping block as cuda gave them so much influence over gpu computing if google is being it for data monopoly. Different level, but to ensure we don’t end up with only nvidia in the gpu computing space, other companies need to be at least compatible with cuda for end consumers can consider them for their deployments.; Just realized I didn’t directly answer your question. I’m open to choice. Right now, you have Apple, google, Microsoft offering online solutions for your every day productivity needs off the top of my head. Offline, you have free alternatives like libreoffice. 

In terms of browsers, i dont believe one should be it and I want Mozilla with Firefox to stick around. It’s just the most expensive application to build and maintain probably on most people’s computer after the operating system. And so you just don’t have these things survive without corporate support. We have WebKit, chromium, and Firefox as the core and only real browser engines. WebKit is apples and apple has enough money to spend to keep it going. But no one wants safari or its derivatives. 

Everything else is chromium. And basically everyone’s choose these days that isnt safari or Firefox is a flavor of chromium. Most of the companies behind the chromium variants couldn’t afford to maintain chromium itself. I can only think Microsoft could afford it. And anyone who buys chrome should pour the same money that googles pours into chromium. Which they won’t. 

I am a Linux user. I’ll use Mac OS. I will use windows. I like the ability to choose a wide variety of tools. People should have that choice.; the list is here https://developer.apple.com/support/browser-choice-screen/; Nope, FF just sucks ass when it comes to a lot of more subtle things. For example, decoding RTC video streams is not hardware optimized whatsoever, crushed CPU compared to Chrome.; Browser is not browser engine. [Seems like the answer is yes, but only in the EU] (https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050478/apple-ios-17-4-browser-engines-eu). Finally... fuck Safari."

4 year returns for the graduating tech employee class of 2021,"Between August 2020 - December 2020, the big 5 tech companires -- AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, META did more interviews, hiring than their past 5 years combined. This cohort of tech employees are the ones that got the easiest interviews, and were able to uplift themselves into better companies even amongst themselves.

Interestingly, META was considered #1, AMZN and MSFT were considered tier 2 in this cohort of people.

I present to you the 4-year returns, because that's how tech world does compensation before you hit the cliff.

This means that someone who started their job on the first day of 2021 (assuming equity deposits, etc. happened the same way, they don't but just imagine), they should have gone to META and not AMZN.

Surprisingly GOOGL turned out to be the best bet in terms of volatility and performance. I can imagine META employees dumping their stock and not holding, GOOGL employees usually do auto sale, but the ones who kept it and didn't sell probably did well.

MSFT and AAPL employees also did well. Good times.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hlvfap/4_year_returns_for_the_graduating_tech_employee/,0,2024-12-25 07:34:30,"# **TLDR**

---

**Ticker:** GOOGL (with AAPL, MSFT close behind)

**Direction:** Up

**Prognosis:**  Buy and Hold (if you're a 2021 tech grad who got stock options).  META might have been the hottest hire, but GOOGL ended up being the best long-term investment.

**Meme-Worthy Observation:** META employees probably kicking themselves for not holding.; Bro, just put my crumbl cookie in the box; Ok.

So buy $GOOG CALLS.

Expensive Stocks vs Cheaper Stocks in Roth IRA,"Sorry in advance is this isn't allowed. Just trying to educate myself a bit more and this seemed like the best sub to ask this

Can someone give me advice on if it's better or worse to buy high priced stocks such as GOOG, APPL, JPM, COST, etc which are very high cost stocks vs cheaper stocks like WMT, CSCO etc. For context I am putting over 50% into SWPPX and SWLGX, I also have a pension and max out my Roth TSP, so I'm looking at my Roth IRA as more a place to be able to perhaps take more risk in it. I'm 41 and only just started my Roth IRA.

So my thinking is for example is it better to buy 2 shares of stock A at $200 per share or 8 shares of stock B at $50 per share, or no difference? I'm smart financially but not the best at stocks and in my brain it seems like stocks inherently have a ceiling and so lower stock of a strong company is better than higher stock of also a strong company.

TIA",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hlukn3/expensive_stocks_vs_cheaper_stocks_in_roth_ira/,4,2024-12-25 06:31:07,"Don’t pay attention to the price of the stock. Focus on the valuation and growth potential. Spend an hour or two on YouTube to educate yourself on this topic and make decisions for yourself since you considered yourself to be good financially.; No difference.; You are looking at share price to measure ""cheapness"". Look at P/E ratios.  
Similarly, you do not look at just the return % of assets. To select assets based on returns look at their Sharpe ratio.

Also, your invested capital matters. The number of shares you buy doesn't matter. You could be holding 1 stock of apple and share price increase by 5%. Your invested capital will also increase by 5%. 

Considering this. I highly recommend consulting a professional or sticking to ETFs like VOO, etc.; In my experience it is better to slightly overpay for a high quality stock then to underpay for a mediocre stock. Also the qualatative features of a company matters just as much if not more than the financials. If I overpay for a S tier company I will still beat inflation. 

Costco and MSFT are not cheap at the moment but if you look at every single S tier company you did very well if you bought at the peak of 2021.; I give two shits about the stock price I’m purchasing at. If it’s a 10 dollar stock or 500 dollars all that maters to me is the percent gain. You invest 10,000 on a low or high stock and return 25%, either way it’s 2500 in profit; If you have 10k your willing to invest that doesn’t matter too much definitely do some longer term expensive stocks ~100$-400$ range but if you don’t have that amount of capital I would recommend to invest in cheaper stocks but not too cheap like ~10$-50$ range for amortization couple thousand. Hold it for a couple years and pull out if they have seemed to of plateaued; What's better, a slice of 12"" pizza or a slice of 20"" pizza?; Price point's of a stock are irrelevant. It's valuation that matters.; It depends on your risk tolerance.

I woke up a few days ago and had lost $16,000 dollars because I have higher risk stock. .. Since then my portfolio has clawed back $12,000 of those $16,000. I stay focused on the fact that if I hadn't have invested in higher risk previously, then I wouldn't have had that $16000 as a percentage of my previous gains to lose.

Its all about risk tolerance and percentages, not cost of stocks.

I would rather make $1,000,000 on riskier stocks then lose $300,000 of that money than to make $400,000 with no loss on safer stocks ..over the same period of time.

It's all about your personal risk tolerance.; The price doesn’t make a stock expensive the PE ratio is what makes it expensive compared to its peers. Do not get hung up on the actual price but the quality of the company.; I like your question, and most of the answers are great examples of traditional investing advice. I have a 401(k), a rollover, IRA, and a state pension… So I started a Roth IRA with the single intention of investing 8000 a year into the best high risk stocks that I can. It’s up 67% since August. I’m buying stocks under $20 that have high risk and high return, are often connected to things like AI and quantum computing. I’m staying away from biomedical because it often seems like all the eggs are in one basket, and RFK is unpredictable. The worst thing you can do is scroll through penny stocks, or WallStreetBets and emotionally attach to what people are saying. The best thing you can do is set up a system, where you understand the fundamentals, the trajectory for growth, get information from several sources, and understand how that company actually makes money. Good luck.; the price of a share multiplied by the amount of shares makes up the market cap. NVIDIA was at 1000 earlier this year and did a forward split so 1 share became 10 and the price went from 1000 to 100. Market cap doesn't change and neither does your balance. 

Companies with smaller market cap have a cheaper upside. A 1 billion dollar company needs one more billion from investors to double the market cap and therefore the share price will 2x. the smaller the market cap the more volatile is the stock. A large cap company is generally more stable but PE like mentioned a lot is also very important. better buy ETFs and learn more buddy; Buy funds not individual stocks for retirement. 

VOO and chill; I feel the very low price stock are the risky, fun stocks that are almost like buying scratch lottery tickets and the more expensive, well known stock that took a long time to reach the price are safer but it will take a long time to make money.  So for a Roth, I would just keep dumping money in safe stocks or funds and not worry about it.  I would use “beer” money for the fun, risky stock.; Buy some shares of $MSTR.  Thank me when you turn 62.  

*This is not financial advice, and you should consult with a financial advisor.; [deleted]; I was thinking of maxing my Roth with either VOO, VTI, QQQ, or MAGS.  which one would you go with? This is over a 20 year span.; Is the angle of the cut the same?; I’m pretty sure that analogy doesn’t work in this case unless the slices are priced according to their size; For example, I will probably buy SOUN tomorrow, after I run through a series of checks. I once had a mini Cooper, moved to a Subaru, and noticed how upset I was about the voice recognition and talkback features. In my everyday life, including this phone right now, I’m dictating voice to text. There’s a lot of apps not getting it right, including Reddit. SOUN is the answer for this… But you still have to look at fundamentals.

Also, not giving financial advice, just as an example how to dig deeper into your purchases.; !Remindme in 6 months; Look at market cap instead of the share price. 

Using your example,

Let's say company A is $50/share
They have 1 billion shares. 
Market cap: $50 billion 


Company B is $200/share 
They have 1 million shares 
Market cap: $200 million 

Believe it or not, with these numbers company B ($200) has more room to grow. 

For company A to double their share price (50->100) they would need to add an additional $50 billion of value to the company. 

For company B to double their share price (200->400) they would need to only add an additional $200 million of value to the company. 

So even though company B has a higher share price, they have less friction to double their value.; Your understanding of stock price isn’t fully developed. The share price itself is irrelevant in comparison to another stock because they will have a different number of available shares. A $1000 can split to be $100 and you now have 10 shares at the exact same value. Additionally if you own 2 shares of a $50 or 1 share of a $100 and they both go up 20%, you’ve increased by the exact same amount of money. Like others have mentioned it’s the value and future expected strength of the company that’s important not the actual share price itself; I will be messaging you in 6 months on [**2025-06-25 06:51:31 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2025-06-25%2006:51:31%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hlukn3/expensive_stocks_vs_cheaper_stocks_in_roth_ira/m3pew0d/?context=3)

Potential AI stock? I would love to spot the next NVIDIA 🎄🧑‍🎄,"Merry Christmas, every investor heading to make the biggest profit!🎄🧑‍🎄

In the current secondary market, chips are no longer the most favored AI investment target. Instead, the spotlight has shifted to AI applications. The U.S. stock market's ""AI+"" trend is producing an increasing number of standout performers.

Recently, AI application stock $**Applovin (APP.US)** reached a new all-time high, with its stock price surging over 850% year-to-date and a market cap exceeding $100 billion, continuing to fuel the AI narrative. Meanwhile, **Palantir (PLTR.US)**, known for its ""AI+Defense"" focus, has also risen an impressive 318% this year.

According to Menlovc data, overall enterprise AI spending has grown from $2.3 billion last year to $13.8 billion this year. While foundational models remain the largest area of expenditure, spending on model deployment and application layers is accelerating at a faster pace.

Here are some potential stocks across various AI-related segments:

Yes yes they are already above 2 trillion. But here’s the thing: they have a forward P/E ratio of 21 while spending billions on ai development. Many ai companies hope to be profitable a few years from now. Google already is, while leading in AI. They are right there with OpenAI, but they look to be able to deliver it much cheaper, which will give them the upper hand. Add in quantum computing and self driving cars, two areas they are also leading in, and google is a steal right now. Other players in these areas are bleeding money. Google could very well become the first 10 trillion dollar company. It won’t happen this year, or next year. But I see Google beating the market for the next decade.

With more and more data going through data centres they are going to need fast processes. Not to mention the processing power needed to run AI Models. 

Poet and a few others have been able to prove 800 G, while poet is ahead on 1600 G. 

Poet does seem to have the edge and patients for how quickly they can manufacture and energy efficiency. Feel it is an under talked about thing how much energy/pollution data centres create, not to mention the cost to run them.

* They make ""manycore"" processors which are like hybrid GPUs and CPUs for doing both sequential and parallel operations.  
* The thesis must have been that they have potential for AI inference due to this flexibility.

|-|-|-|-|; I’ve got some nice quantum chips I can let you have cheap. Please dm your cc info.; Temporary issue, may shoot up like SOUN did in the next 1-3 years. Partnerships are looking decent.; That should be fixed within the next year or so, the power of AI is being realised in the government so the contracts should be rolling in soon.; PDYN; Lots of DD out there, mini PLTR type company. Good management and lots of potential.; People are already accessing quantum computing through AWS and google cloud using IONQs computer for research. Not a novelty; this was the ai convo 15 years ago. its worth putting some in, even at an ETF if not specific to BBAI or other Quantum stock. easier market cap to reach; I think the calculating power is so big it defeats current encryption (passwords).

So they will be needed to create better encryption that can not be hacked by quantum computers.; I think BESI is working on the same thing and they already have a partnership with TSM on hybrid bonding.; Buy now. I grabbed some a few months ago.; We have an AI portfolio of 7 stocks that we will be buying in the dips until 2030. I think in a couple of years everyone will want in on NET.; What's wrong with ACHR? It seems to be doing pretty well. Military contacts, signed deal in Abu Dhabi, and price has been climbing slowly and holding. Went from like $4 to $15.; It's a mostly shitty product, that too many people build entire startups around without actually understanding what it does, what is it capable of and what it isn't. They are selling these insane and grand ideas to investors who do not understand it themselves, but are pouring money on it for crazy valuations. This is a bubble and it will burst.; Right?  Dude lists META, MA, and APPL as the next NVDA's lmao....I don't know if IRM will explode that huge, but data centers are needed more and more in a digital world.; Currently cheap AI with government contracts 😎; That’s ten minutes you could have been scrolling.; ‘Temporary issue’ 🙄; I don’t understand what that means. Do they have some commercial use? Are companies making money of the technology?; POET Technologies and Besi are quite different. POET focuses on using light to create super-fast data connections for AI and data centers, like building highways for information.   
  
In contrast, Besi makes the machines that assemble various computer chips for smartphones, cars, and more. While POET is still growing with its innovative ideas, Besi is an established company with a wide range of products.   
  
Both play important roles in technology but are working on different parts of the industry. ; Just grabbed a bit too. Let’s see where this goes; What's your portfolio?; Oh.... you must not look much at fundamentals.; I was in until you used the cool emoji 😑; Yes.
AWS (Amazon Web Services) engages with quantum computing through its Amazon Braket service, which provides a platform for exploring, experimenting, and developing quantum computing solutions. Here's how AWS uses quantum computers:


1. Amazon Braket Platform


Access to Quantum Hardware: Amazon Braket provides access to quantum computers from leading providers like D-Wave, IonQ, and Rigetti. Users can experiment with different quantum hardware technologies, including:


Superconducting Qubits: From providers like Rigetti.


Trapped Ions: From IonQ.


Quantum Annealers: From D-Wave, which specializes in optimization problems.




Simulators: For users without access to physical quantum computers, Braket offers classical quantum simulators to test and refine algorithms.




2. Hybrid Computing


AWS integrates classical and quantum computing to solve problems using hybrid algorithms, which use classical computation to assist quantum algorithms. This is particularly useful for tasks like optimization, machine learning, and material simulation.


3. Research and Development


AWS is investing in quantum research through the AWS Center for Quantum Computing:


Located in Pasadena, California, near the California Institute of Technology (Caltech).


Focused on advancing the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers.


Exploring breakthroughs in quantum algorithms and error correction.




4. Quantum Solutions for Industries


AWS helps businesses explore how quantum computing can address industry-specific challenges, such as:


Financial Services: Portfolio optimization and risk analysis.


Healthcare: Drug discovery and molecular simulation.


Logistics: Route optimization and supply chain management.




5. Education and Training


AWS offers resources, workshops, and tools to help users learn quantum programming using languages like PennyLane and Qiskit, and experiment with quantum circuits.


AWS’s approach focuses on providing access, resources, and tools to make quantum computing more accessible to researchers, businesses, and developers. While quantum computing is still in its early stages, AWS is positioning itself as a key player in building the infrastructure and ecosystem for its future applications.; Are apes?; BESI makes hybrid bonding tools that are mainly used to vertically stack chips to advance Moore's Law, but they are now using this technology to align fiber optics, which makes the alignment process more efficient. 

POET is trying to disrupt this process by incorporating fiber optics directly onto the chip to skip the alignment process all together. 

They are in direct competition. It's a matter of who can do it cheaper.; Let me ask you something. How much do you spend per year on financial services i.e. newsletter, conferences?; Well please elaborate, you're yet to answer my question.; Thanks ChatGPT.; Oh wow, I had no idea. Thank you for a great answer. Are there any applications for businesses or ""regular"" people yet?; Well its P/B ratio is in the 9s. It is trading completey on speculation and very high operating costs and the need to generate much more to stay operating. The price on these type of shocks does come back down to reality eventually.; Welcome. It's that easy. ; Something side related but shows you Amazons planning behind this. $52 Billion for new data centres across 3 States. Amazon have a $300 million feasibility study with Northwest Energy. Plan is to build 4 SMR Nuclear Small Modular Reactors with potential for 12. Northwest will own them, Amazon will get priority for energy for their  data centres.; No, you can't perform useful computations on a quantum computer today. The ideas and algorithms are there but the tech isn't (yet). We need more qubits and they need to be more stable; I’m regular.; Very interesting indeed. I""ve already nade bank on SMR and Oklo. Guess I gotta dtart looking seriously into quantum.; This. These stocks are rising but will fall back to earth temporarily when analysts look at their actual revenue. It's not there yet.; Do you think SMR and Oklo will continue to skyrocket? I’m thinking of buying some SMR/OKLO; I love their products and their numbers. I don’t wanna be the reason you lose money, but I'm gonna buy some more before the year's out. I'm using tight stop losses on both, though, as I expect them to continue to be volatile."

Got in with 100 at 23, watched it go down to 7ish and shut it out from my brain, didnt DCA, then watched it slowly climb back up to break even, and past, now at 80 with still 100 shares because I kept telling myself it will just go back down again; Wow , long term investing?  Are you Warren Ducking Buffet ?!!; *cue worlds smallest violin* 

At least you had the opportunity to buy AAPL at those levels in 2014. Some of us were in middle/high school at the time.; 10X but you put in nothing…
This is more disappointing than seeing that one guy go to $1M from nothing then tank back down again; Little by little a little becomes a lot; If you sell your position in Apple then you can afford to buy more of your next 14 bagger. But in all seriousness, whenever someone has a massive gain like this, they’ll always think “I wish I bought more” whether their initial investment was 1k or 100k. The only people who dont think that are the ones that had 100% of their portfolio invested.; For the time passed it's just not worth it. I know, profit is profit, but Sir... $23k profit in 11 years is nothing.

You could've bought 15 BTC and today you would be sitting at $1.4 million.; It's fake. RH wasn't around the time when AAPL was trading at $17. 😵‍💫; That's an old fucking bet!; You inherited that from nana?; butter than me. i never buy any lol; 12 years to make 23k, nice.

Not saying it’s bad but my god that’s a long term investment; Congrats!

So that 97 shares in 2012 terms is 3.46 shares.  So OP obviously sold some shares along the way.  Should have held onto them!; Last time AAPL was that cheap was 2013. Not that long ago tbh. Or maybe I'm just getting old.; Still impressive to see that he bought Apple at $17 a share take a chill pill; He's been mulling around WSB now that he doesn't have Nana to talk to anymore.; Cause people are smart. Instead of blowing up their account with 0 DTE’s; Could’ve bought Tesla; I held from 17 and sold at 50. kicking myself now; This is the mental anquish I am currently going through with KULR.  I bought some at like 0.86 and sold at $1.37 to make a safe profit, then bought back in at $1.37 with 1200 shares, sold at $1.57 like a regard.  Watched it go up to almost 3 dollars that same day, and was kicking myself the whole way.  Could have gotten back in around 2 but was convinced it had reached the top for at least a while, now its at almost 5 and I'm wondering if I should get back in at $4.50 for a ten dollar run or wait for my $2.46 limit buy when it might be too late.  
TL;DR, I had the opportunity to make about 5k and sold with a ~250 gain.; This. Invested 100% of a rollover IRA and split it into 3 stocks, I am going to finally realize some of the Tesla gains during the run up to earnings end of Jan.

My bad for being 13 back then; Because this is like going on a sub for classic hot rods and posting a picture of your stock civic.

Assuming same price stays the same calculating theta decay is not that hard.


I mean it's literally 30 seconds if you use an option price calculator; You will lose theta but I think you will stay green; This whole idea of Theta being active when the stock market is closed feels criminal. They need to find a way to suspend Theta on days like this. Doesn’t even feel right; Will see a drop with theta, but i think you will be fine if not green by the end of the day. Tech stocks are holding us up this week. AAPL being one of them. I can see this printing🤞"

Its just like buying any other shares its just a stock, like buying SPY shares for example. You can day trade it or hold it up to you. Lemme know if that answers your question. (Keep in mind if TSLA were to go down 10% then TSLL would go down 20% obviously so thats why it’s riskier).; thanks. i read something about how leveraged products “decay” over time, i think due to the price resetting or something? but maybe that is entirely different.; Decay is a very real thing with leveraged ETFs: https://www.moomoo.com/community/feed/the-decay-risk-of-investing-in-multi-fold-leveraged-etfs-111742762024970; People use the word decay out of ignorance.

Daily compounding is the thing that causes increasing effects, up or down.

https://www.wisdomtree.eu/fr-fr/-/media/eu-media-files/users/documents/4211/short-leverage-etfs-etps-compounding-explained.pdf; thanks, so what i am wondering is: if decay is something to avoid, and to avoid decay you want to avoid holding overnight, then is there a risk of being able to exit the holding at end of day at an idea price (as why would somebody buy the ETF off you near end of day)?; Isn't that decay though?

Because the % change is multiplied, there is more downside than upside. Not sure how to describe this well... but let's say you hold for 2 days, with a % change after each. Moving a fixed amount (say 10%) down from $100 of principal (original value) towards 0% of principal (thus $90) on day 1 is ""worse"" than moving that same amount above 100% (to $110) because the relative change required on day 2 to return to $100 increases asymptotically as value held after day 1 approaches $0 (-100% loss on day 1). Because +1% is not as ""good"" as -1% down is ""bad"", the fact that a flat multiplier (3x) is applied to the % change means that the magnification skews towards negative effect in net.

As an example, if your principal is $100 and you take a -10% loss your 1X = $90, 3x = $70.
From here, to return to $100 you need a +11% gain for the $90, but a +43% gain on the $70. If you get that +11% gain on the 1X, you'll only get a +33% gain on the 3X which means your principal is restored on the 1X but not on the 3X.

This is not better in reverse. If instead you gain +10% your 1X = $110, 3X = $130. It takes a -9% loss to return $110 to $100, and a -23% loss to return $130 to $100. This means a -7.7% loss will undo all your gains on the 3X, but you'll still be ahead on the 1X.

The effects are much smaller with lower percentages (like a more realistic +-0.5% per compounding period) but it's directionally the same. In the extreme, the effect scales up - to the point where a 33% loss on the 1X will completely wipe you out on the 3X.

That's why it ""decays"" and trends towards net loss any time there is a directional change (volatility). It's only when you have relatively consistent gains that the magnification can scale up / accelerate. Volatility is to be expected on most timescales, so these leveraged ETFs can be very useful for certain functions but are nearly guaranteed to trail the index they track over longer time periods in a sufficiently volatile market, especially when considering fees. Originally thought it wasn't suitable for long time periods, but after checking some performances they *can* perform very well over longer time periods depending on the market and timing.; Liquidity and tax drag are the bigger concerns.; I’m not even close to being well-versed on leveraged ETFs, so I’d suggest asking your questions on the LETF subreddit. r/investing is pretty much all VOO and chill.; \-the word decay out of ignorance

See that's the thing. The word decay doesn't have any meaning. People throw it around without any explanation.

You went through and calculated it very carefully, gave it meaning and knowledge. That's a big difference.

TQQQ and a few similar ones are the only ones that have produced high long term returns. 99% of the rest are huge losses.; And decay and high fees."
"When Tech Eventually Fizzles, Will U.S. Continue to Dominate? Backtesting Excluding Tech vs. Global Markets","Edit: People are misunderstanding the question. I’m not bearish on tech. It’s more of a question of US continuing to out perform the global market once the expected returns on tech slows.

TL;DR: As tech’s strong performance fades (maybe it doesn’t, but eventually, it might), why should we believe the U.S. market will continue to outperform globally? Has anyone already backtested the S&P 500 excluding tech—especially the “Magnificent 7”—and compared its performance to developed and emerging markets?

Over the past 15 years, the U.S. market has massively outperformed global equities, leading to the narrative that U.S. governance, monetary policy, the strength of the dollar (as the global reserve currency), and favorable geopolitical conditions will continue to support this dominance. This view is widely accepted in this community (you can find tons of discussions on this by searching “international” here if you haven’t already).

However, the primary driver of U.S. outperformance has been the tech sector, particularly the “Magnificent 7” (Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Google, Amazon, Tesla, and Meta). A quick search shows that these companies have been responsible for a significant portion of U.S. market returns over the past two decades, with tech alone contributing heavily to the growth of the S&P 500.

But what happens when the tech sector eventually hits a slowdown or correction? While it could continue to dominate for another decade, at some point, the market may shift, and another sector or region could rise to prominence. So, if tech (especially the Magnificent 7) loses its edge, what is left to support U.S. market dominance?

I’m particularly interested in whether anyone has backtested the S&P 500 excluding tech stocks (especially the MAG 7) and compared its performance against global markets—both developed and emerging. Excluding the top tech names from the S&P 500 could provide a more realistic view of the underlying market performance without the distortion caused by these mega-cap stocks, which are arguably overvalued or at least priced for significant future growth.

I’m asking this because, as a long-term, passive investor, I think the MAG 7 may be overvalued, and their strong returns over the past 15 years might not be sustainable. To further diversify my portfolio, I’ve begun investing in US mid and small-cap S&P funds, but I’m also looking to increase my exposure to global equities. From what I can see, excluding tech from the equation, international equities don’t appear to underperform as much relative to U.S. stocks. So, I’m interested in seeing if global diversification, especially in emerging markets, would still yield solid returns after this adjustment.

A few questions I have:
Has anyone conducted a backtest or analysis of the S&P 500’s performance excluding the Magnificent 7? How does it compare to global markets, particularly developed and emerging markets?

If tech returns eventually fizzle out (or at least grow more slowly), should we expect the U.S. to continue outperforming? What other sectors or factors might drive U.S. market growth in the future?

I’ve prepared myself for critical feedback—Drag me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hkr1z4/when_tech_eventually_fizzles_will_us_continue_to/,0,2024-12-23 17:12:33,"Commenting to see the updates. I am a firm believer that the US market growth will continue to dominate and grow with time, i think that the USA has this innovation mentality and a stock market mentality very different from others markets that plays a big role in its performance; Unless I’m missing something, you haven’t presented a bear case for big tech beyond “it could happen.” Personally I’m betting on humanity continue to grow increasingly reliant on tech and wealth continuing to consolidate.; Bruh, the US is about the innovation, always progressing, always pivoting. Stop overthinking things. ; I feel that a backtest that excludes the best performers tells you very little because almost *all* return of the overall market have come from a minority of best performers that compensated for everyone else being pretty bad. Here is research that shows this since 1926. [https://wpcarey.asu.edu/department-finance/faculty-research/do-stocks-outperform-treasury-bills](https://wpcarey.asu.edu/department-finance/faculty-research/do-stocks-outperform-treasury-bills)

I hold market cap int'l btw.; Because Europe is lazy (IE they don't want to work 70 hours per week), Japan still uses fax machines and is too prideful to overcome the sunk cost falacy that happens to all emerging tech, China is not yet innovative enough but they are very close, although their tech will largely stay in China because it will mimic US tech, not lead it, Africa is Africa, the middle east doesn't have the talent, and Central and South America don't have the money or the drive. So yeah, the US will continue to outperform, slightly, when it comes to tech for the next 10-30 years.; Tech is science; it will only accelerate, not “fizzle.”; The U.S. will always have McDonalds and the Quarter Pounder, baby (Royale with Cheese in Paris).   There’s Coca Cola, though internationalized, etc.. There’s a lot of non-US brands and even some international brands that sell different models in the U.S./Canada; example: Toyota, via its “North American” subsidiary didn’t sell the plain “Hi-Lux” pick up in the U.S. until very recently but offered it to the rest of the world.   Brands will continue to be strive to be global just due to more customers, .. using their college trained workforces to skirt undue tariffs, and consumer tastes (and perhaps restrictions?) will be most vital. 

Tech wise the U.S. has had an advantage piggybacking off its relatively large defense budgets (all U.S. degreed engineers must complete 4 classes of calculus post-Sputnik scare for example after the late 1950s) and a relatively free society, ..  not sure that’ll really change.   Despite seemingly backtracking on education, the defense industry and more thoughtful minds in Congress know about drones, AI, robotics, etc.. 

What seems to be happening though is with mid-level engineering, it’s pretty much China and India as powerhouses.   There’s also the physical facilities, but what role does better automation play in that? 

Anyways to complete my story, in Paris they still call a Big Mac a Big Mac but they call it Le Big Mac (*Pulp Fiction* reference).  Entertainment will still be big from the US too, but some subtitled (for Americans) films have won big in the Oscars.; I think the market will crash a bit but I don’t think it’ll be any different than a normal crash. The mag 7 companies are all(or mostly all) working on some pretty game changing stuff. I foresee a lot more growth to come.; All S&P 500 companies are tech companies. A company like Dominoes has dominated for a long time because of their use of technology in ordering, delivering and the cooking process. You either use tech or you go out of business and, in order to use tech, you need tech people or the ability to outsource it. You may have an inherent competitive advantage if you can build it yourself though.

You could say that energy is not tech but we have the shale revolution which was a technological revolution.; OP is correct that US over-performance is mostly due to tech sector, which is arguably over valued and over-hyped by most metrics. But having said that, every 3 years or so, the next new thing is going to pop up. Now its AI for example.

US seems to dominate in tech ""innovation"".  Taiwan is player with semis. Japan and europe are players. But the US is the locomotive engine at the front of the tech train, for good or bad. Many US tech companies crash and burn, but the survivors become the global leaders in tech.

Can ""emerging market"" like India be major player in tech?  I dunno not specialist in that part of the India market. If or when that happens then it happens. Change is constant..; If for whatever reason another sector like energy takes favor over tech , china, India and other energy producers could out perform; Where else is there to go anyway if you don’t believe in the USA anymore? Europe? China? Japan? 

I’d argue if the USA stalls, so will everyone else.; US tech is global, anyways, and that's amidst a world that's becoming more connected than ever before. The companies also have immense capital available, or the ability to out-leverage almost anyone smaller that's a threat. Anything new that's promising will just be acquired by US tech companies and rolled into the portfolio.

As wealth increases globally and emerging markets/international demographics have growing access to US tech, that's what they'll choose (both products and investing). US tech products are high in demand globally, even those that are relatively expensive domestically (e.g. Apple products).

People are obviously free to invest in whatever they want and try to ""diversify"" as much as they want, but unless something radical happens (which would result in global economic pain anyways), US (and particularly US tech) will continue to dominate.; Don't forget: ""this time it's different!"" ;-)

IT guy since the 90's here. I wish there was a way to make money off the teach fizzling predictions over the years.; Tech has in the past bet big on things that failed. The field is littered with tech stars that no longer exist. Currently tech is spending huge amounts on “AI”, but the demand for those products isn’t there, which means profits may suffer. Will that happen, it’s hard to say, but betting on tech in its current state is definitely risky. 

If you want a sober counterpoint to the tech hype, check out Ed Zitron’s writing. https://www.wheresyoured.at/. Not saying he’s 100% correct, but to be an informed investor you need to look at a wide variety of inputs (also true in politics…) 

Another often-pessimistic opinion on tech topics worth considering is Cory Doctorow. https://pluralistic.net/

I personally have a big stake in tech, I’ve worked my entire life in tech, but again, just because it’s been doing great doesn’t mean it will keep going like that indefinitely.; Tech as a sector hasn’t always been a top performer until recently 
https://novelinvestor.com/sector-performance/; With that logic I should just QQQ and chill; This is exactly what I am saying. Once another sector carries the market like energy,materials, or industrials does the US market continue to out perform?; All fair points, but maybe my question wasn’t clear. What happens when expected returns for tech stabilize, growth flattens, and  another sector takes favor? If the US market is propped up by tech, will it continue to out perform?; Idk, visiting China makes me feel like the US is the one that's behind, not China. Sure we may rush out MVPs for services, but it feels like China took most of our techs and infrastructure and completed it.; Don’t know why you’re being downvoted. This is very correct.; Maybe fizzle is the wrong word, but it it is arguably overvalued priced and has lower expected returns. Another sector will eventually come into favor.; lol Atleast one person agrees; Exactly! I’m European and I’m not investing a single buck in Europe. China will for sure grow and become even more a giant as it is today but it doesn’t mean the Chinese stock market will do so as well. India can be promising too but I have no knowledge on this market and it doesn’t mean thqt its stocks will have a bright future either.; Literally the only informed comment on this thread. I was hoping for deeper discussion than “nothing can stop US Innovation”; ….because it wasn’t always a top earner. Now it is. It’s seriously not rocket science.

And do you see people wanting *fewer* IPhones, smart TV’s, and video games? I don’t.; Think what has the most potential for future growth, what do we rely on to improve our quality of life, what are the current challenges we face and what we are doing to solve them.; You should

“When tech fizzles” lmao.. zoom out man; ? I'm not agreeing with you, I'm trying to argue against a backtest that excludes the Mag7. Excluding best performers from a backtest makes no sense; Because that is not how asset pricing works.


Everyone knows what he said and equities are priced accordingly. US is priced as this perfect market with perfect companies, any misstep will result in very steep valuation adjustments. On the other hand, Europe/China are priced at negative growth by the market, all they need is to show up and will probably outperform.; I think people are misunderstanding my question. They think I am bearish tech, but what the question really revolves around is US outperforming the global market in the future.; Not sure I agree. There has been a recent sudden acceleration in the field of generative AI that appears to be “stabilizing” (perhaps a euphemism for slowing down ☺️), but overall, I believe the technology sector will always continue to grow unless some kind of catastrophic event occurs or government policy begins to hinder it.; I’ve personally experienced things that can stop US innovation, and the biggest factor is greed. I worked for a startup that had a decent offer to get bought, the founders turned it down because it wasn’t enough $, the company folded the year after. 

Doctorow writes about the endless need for growth causing products to get exponentially worse. The word he coined to describe this was recognized in 2024 as a “word of the year”: https://www.techspot.com/news/105733-rise-enshittification-officially-word-year.html; My question revolves around out performance once it isn’t a top earner anymore..; No place on earth outside of the US encourages, let alone achieves, any semblance of innovation. That is in relation to tech, or any other industry for that matter.; Agreed, but to expected returns / Stock price continue to grow as fast as other sectors in the future?; “Unless some kind of catastrophic event occurs”… 
catastrophes do occur on a semi-regular basis. Some of them are predictable, others less so. In fact, government policy toward tech is about to change dramatically, in less than a month.; A similar sentiment was shared in 1999 about the internet….at some point, valuations do matter and stock price growth can’t rely on multiple expansion.

Too many big tech names have valuations well beyond their 10-year averages; Thank you for sharing; Yep, Trump and his anti-science nutjobs are gonna tank the economy. This is exactly the kind of catastrophic event I was referring to 😉"
I fixed my $4.15MM account deficit. Be aware of the risk of option early assignment.,"**Outcome**

At 9:45AM ET on Monday (12/23/2024), my $4.12MM account deficit issue has been fixed.

I lost $8200 because my put credit spread become worthless.

I got my $4.12MM debit back.

**Previous post with all context**

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hjh68x/4\_million\_account\_deficit\_due\_to\_option\_early/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hjh68x/4_million_account_deficit_due_to_option_early/)

**Timeline**

00:01 AM ET, 12/21, on Saturday (Friday midnight): I got RH notifications that I got early assignments on my short put positions. I had to buy 3300 SPY and 4900 DIA shares, which led to the $4.12MM deficit issue in my RH account.

Saturday (12/21): I shared my situations on Reddit. Thanks the Reddit community. I learned a ton about this complex option event and risk management. I was very stressful still.

Sunday (12/22): reviewed and replied to hundreds of comments on my Reddit post. Looking for the best strategy or solution. Be prepared to handle on Monday morning.

Around 11:30PM ET, RH system queued my 33x SPY and 49 DIA puts for exercise automatically without my consent. I chatted 2 times with the RH agents via the RH app. They responded quickly, shared basic information, but did not help that much because they don't have the same access as the folks in RH risk or operation team. I tried to cancel the queued order by myself, but the RH app disallow me to do so. I was planning to handle my positions manually on Monday morning but this restriction did not provide me any choices. So I go back to sleep.

Monday morning (12/23): I waked up at 8:30am ET, called RH human agent over the phone at 9:20am ET, waited 5 minutes and talked to the agent at 9:25am ET. He explained that the RH system will make best strategy to reduce the loss when closing positions for customers. He confirmed that there is a little extrinct value left in the puts. Exercise is the best option here, so the system schedule to exercise automatically.

Finally, my 33x SPY puts and 49x DIA puts were exerised (3300 SPY shares were sold at strike price $607, and 4900 DIA shares were sold at strike price $444).

At 9:45AM ET on Monday (12/23/2024), my $4.12MM account deficit issue has been fixed.

**Take aways**

Early assignment: If you short any options, you have the obligation for early assignment. The option buyers have the rights to exercise options at any time, which selling their corresponding shares to you. If you don't have enough fund in your account, you will borrow margin to buy shares.

Vertical spread: RH app shows the max gain and max loss when you trade vertical spreads. It works most of time, but in reality, we could lost more due to early assignment, margin borrow, wide price spread, hard to close due to insufficient liquility. Take consider of all the possibilities.

Index option: Just learned about index options like SPX. It is european-style option which will not have early assignment and always settle in cash.

Interest rate of borrow margin with early assignment: RH generously waived all the interest occured by early assignment. So I do not need to pay any extra interest for this. Early assignment is out of user's control.

Dividends when short an option: Lots of folks saying that we may need to pay the dividends if the short option position is ITM and on ex-dividend date. This is really complicated and vary case by case. I could confirm vertical spreads do not have anything to do with this. Don't worry too much if you have long/short the option at the same time.

Option exercise: it is funny that my options were exercise at 9:30AM when the market opened on Monday. OCC could only settle the request in the midnight after the market close at 5:30PM ET. RH has an internal system, which they processed the order internally first.

About RH: To be honest, RH has been improved a lot. Their customer support was responsive. They picked the least risky strategy closing positions and waived the margin interest for early assignemnts.

Finally, I want to thank you all the redditors who have replied, helped, and blessed me on this drama thing. We are good to enjoy the holidays now.

The numbers look impressive. But this is basically, max loss...

Your trade was busted right when $JPOW started talking, and no broker could have changed that...; See, this is why keeping your port really small is the best strategy.; Legit hopes this helps other regards be less regarded; I have, no fucking idea what any of this means. I just see big number; The brokerage should pay you a fee for protecting their capital.; Dude, trade SPX. Cash settled so no assignment risk. Also more favorable tax treatment. 

Use XSP for smaller contract size. 

Glad it worked out for you; No one will learn anything from reading your post including you.  You will keep selling option spreads.; glad you came out ok!; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640) whats this?; if you lost 8200$ , why do you put the ""GAIN"" tag ?; If my math is right, the max you were supposed to lose was 3300+4900=8200 minus the credit you received when you sold these credit spreads, isn't it?

But due to early assignment you had a margin debt on which interest was charged, how much was it?

I feel like this was RH shenanigan to earn interest from you. I notice that those SPY puts still have around $0.20 left each contract, that's like $660 for those 608 calls. RH can simply eat the premium cost if it offsets the interest earned, because I do not understand why anyone else would exercise a option contract which still has premium left, they lose money.

  
On second thought, impossible to know the real premium of those puts without doing a trade since the spread is wide.; Serious question: can I use this strat to impress a girl with huge numbers in RH account over a weekend for 1 night stand?

My NPC convo is ""I am rolling millions with a tip of my fingers, loook at me"". I mean.... big number is a big number. Outside of this sub, having something something millions (even in red) and then ""successfully"" resolving it does ring ""smart nerd""  vibe.; RH best strategy to rectify the situation would most likely have you at a loss. I had a similar situation with TSLA on think or swim. Had the whole plan setup with calculations. TD risk management locked me out of the positions and refused to allow for my plan to be executed. My plan would have net me over $100k in profit and their ""best plan"" ended up with me breaking even. Needless to say it was very frustrating to watch their automated system execute terrible trades.; This is why I will never do anything with options that isn’t in my control. People do not understand the complexities of options trading. If you asked them what the difference between euro options and US options was (which is extremely relevant to OPs situation) they’ll have no clue.; *You okay dude?*; You are regarding with this much amount?; Hate when that happens; Can they waive your RH Gold too?; [deleted]; Thanks for the update OP. I’m sorry that happened. I know it’s a lot of money for you.; you held shorts ITM on dec MOPEX 

I once had this happen on etrade, woke up to $600k deficit because i was long some shares of spy 

luckily SPY tanked and I covered and made some cash 

but then I had to pay the dividend 

wait until you have to pay the dividend too; OP: when did you first learn about option exercise and assignment?  

You may also wanna read op on euro-style vs american-style options.; I live in europe. You guys are crazy, and yor options are ridiculous. We have cfd. Its easy. Why there are no cfds in usa ?; Could you explain the vertical spread lack of need to worry about dividend assignment?  I know having short calls on ex div can be risky but how does it work on a spread ?; When I owe the broker 4 million, that’s their problem 😂; Next time, bet on SPX index option lol; 100% seriousness - theoretical outcomes aren’t what always happens with options.  Too many calculate values at expiration and everything that happens in the middle can dramatically change the economics.

Be careful out there people.  Be especially careful with short options.; IBKR just liquidates my put contracts at 3:56 PM. A whole diff story; Glad you solved your problem, but this isn't drama. This is literally how spreads work. Do NOT trade options strategies you know nothing about. Better yet, stop trading options. Especially if you can't be bothered to learn.

Options are ALWAYS auto exercised on the morning AFTER the expiry if they expire in the money.  
Your consent isn't needed for them to auto exercise the options when it's THEIR millions of dollars on the line, and not yours. Because if you screw it up, you'll never pay it back and you'll file for bankruptcy, leaving them out the money. Trying to cancel the orders that RH auto put in to save yourself a couple thousand  because you think you can manually manage risk better than they can is arrogant and irresponsible.

You need to delete your account, or at least pause it while you learn more about your gambling.

EDIT: early assignment is absolutely in your control. The control? DO NOT SELL THE CONTRACT if you're not willing to take on the costs of early assignment. The control you have is when you pressed the trade button when really you should have punched yourself in the dick.; [deleted]; Kind of ridiculous that Robinhood hasn’t fixed this yet. Surprised there aren’t more of these.; Natural selection took place.
20yo is not a kid. You are old enough to vote, enlisted, etc

Downloading the app, Playing with a product u don't understand well enough, and not bothering to learn the basics.
Then, when shitz happen, how about thinking whether the numbers make sense, and perhaps clarify/call up RH like what the OP did. 

So many steps along the way, he can stop to think and make the smarter choice in just one step and things will turn out much better.; I'll never trade credit spreads, it's not worth it giving up intrinsic value for premium and facing spread loss no way; what about 1700?; You can do spreads with small accounts. With just $1k in your account, could open a single TSLA spread right now that would display a $45k deficit on early assignment.



And at no point was OP actually $4 million in the hole. He was covered by the other leg of his spreads. Robinhood just displays early assignment in a really stupid way.; I knew I wasn’t mooning my portfolio for a reason; My dude learned a lot about options... with $4.2 million in play... would make Dr Evil blow his load; Too many word, too few rockets and even less moons. I assume OP is a gei ber and wanted to be assfckd, but he wasn't.; Same here and I don’t know why I even read these posts.  For me it’s buy stock, stock do good or stock do bad.; Same, brother.

Someone explain it like we’re two, please.; > Use XSP for smaller contract size.  
  
I only knew about $SPX, but this is much more in my comfort zone. Thanks!; So you sell puts on SPX without having the collateral cash?; Credit spreads are fine.; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); LOL I missed that! They did it because they only lost that and not 

>I got my $4.12MM debit back.

\-$8,200 is closer to a gain than -$4,120,000 they felt they lost.; what about 1700 in credit spread?; You can show her a paper trading account; I bet it has to do with money; Market opens at 9:30 ET fam… however I completely agree with all of your other points lol OP is a knob; It was a credit spread so you short position cover the long position and you only need difference of both leg as collateral. So for a put credit spread if you choose 580/575 strike rate you will only need 500 per contract; Room temp IQ take right here folks ^^^


OP had zero clue what he was doing or trading. The whole point of a credit spread is to mitigate risk when selling options. The 'sell to open' leg of the contract is your money maker, your bread and butter (Theta gangs take; we all know they're just picking up pennies in front of a steam roller) 


The 'buy to open' leg of the contract is your protection in case your short leg (the sell to open contract that you're trying to make money off of) expires ITM. 


Anyone who read the post who has basic working knowledge of credit spreads knew OP was going to be fine. How did we know this? Because his long leg of the contracts (the buy to open one) was his protection against being on the hook for millions of dollars that he does not have. He would lose his premium 'collected' and whatever was being held as collateral. 


If he got assigned on a Friday, how do you expect anything to happen over the weekend? Markets are closed, can't trade shares or do anything until Monday morning. 


This is a simple case of OP simply not knowing what the fuck he was doing. He saw the assignment and panicked, not understanding what the purpose of the long leg of the contract is for. 


Pin-risk is where the real potential for excitement comes from with spreads. Doesn't apply to early assignment though. 


TLDR: OP is a fuckin moron and so is the guy im replying to, probably more than OP tbh; There’s nothing to fix here. Maybe the fix is not let people sell spreads when they don’t understand the risk.; Nothing's broken, this is literally how spreads work. Until the long side of the spread is closed, the balance is negative. What needs fixing is giving every regard a margin account.; They don't have you agree you understand all this before allowing you to do all this? That's definitely criminal, just sue them!; How RH is still in business after shit they pull is beyond me.; Yeah, you definitely didn’t make any mistakes at 20. Jesus Christ. This is the most callous, reddit-coded comment I’ve seen all day.; I understood the first 5 words of this.; I’m so old mooning means something different to me.; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|53057); feed to chatgpt and ask for ELI5; Personally, I sell credit spreads. That is risky if you are not careful. I have the cash collateral to cover the spread risk. I will risk up to 10% of my portfolio at a time.; No.; I can shoe her my monopoly money too; Because I didn't understand the words that you assembled together up there, I take that to mean I should stay away from that kind of shit.

No sir. None of that for me. I'll just lose money the simple way: By buying way out of the money calls hoping for some massive green erection to save me from decay.; This guy tradez; Not sure how anything I said makes you think I don't understand how credit spreads work but ok, go on, king.; I’m new to trading and have no idea what this means at all…. could you perhaps be so kind to dumb it down for me? I keep seeing all these posts of people’s accounts being millions of dollars in deficit…… this is absolutely crazy to me.; Someone always wants a babysitter for stupidity. But really, they have it all along with Darwinism.; Yeah we all made mistakes, but you have to be special to make every mistake available to you; Show off; You're not old compadre, mooning still means what you think it means 🙏 just an additional degenerate meaning created in this sub; Here’s an ""Explain Like I’m 5"" (ELI5) version of your situation:

You were playing a game where you promised to buy something (like stocks) at a certain price if someone else wanted to sell it to you. This is called ""selling options."" However, in this case, the person who bought from you decided to make you buy those things (stocks) earlier than you expected, and you didn’t have enough money in your account to do so. This caused a big money problem, a $4.12 million hole in your account.

Luckily, the company you were using to trade (Robinhood) helped fix the issue. They automatically processed the trade for you and didn’t charge you extra fees. You lost a bit of money because of the way things happened, but the big deficit was resolved by the end of the day.

In short: When you sell options, the person who buys them can ask you to do something sooner than expected, and if you’re not ready for that, it can cause a big mess. Robinhood helped you clean it up without charging extra fees.

  
Oh, the wonders of the new dystopian world we live in.; Such a great idea. Thanks!; Are you selling 0DTE? How much credit are you netting, mind sharing a sample spread to look at?; That's okay dude. Credit spreads aren't as scary as they seem but they do require you to have decent understanding of how options work. 


You're not an idiot if you don't understand how credit spreads work. You're an idiot if you don't know how credit spreads work, lie and say you do, and then go and on post on the internet that your position has gone tits up because you got assigned, while still having your protection.

You blame robinhood like they had anything to do with this. OP gets assigned on a Friday. Obviously going into the weekend he is going to have a negative balance. He can't exercise his long legs or sell the shares he was assigned. How do you do that on a Saturday or a Sunday?????


It's on OP for not knowing what the other half of the contract is for. Robinhood did nothing wrong here other than display the data as is. I can tell you from experience that it would have been the same thing from any other broker. If you get assigned on a Friday, and your contracts don't expire on that same Friday you get assigned, you're going into the weekend with some scary numbers. Not a cause for panic, unless you're a regard for not knowing what you're doing. 


That idiot who offed himself brought a lot of negative attention to trading when he committed suicide. And it was all due to his own stupidity. Clearly it was before your time in the market 


YOU fail to hold those accountable for their own actions. You literally say robinhood hasn't 'fixed this' yet, like they have anything to fix to begin with. Didn't know robinhood had a special pill for stupid

The toxicity, and especially the self-humility, of WSB once used to moderate this place.

The toxicity isn't as fun and the self-humility is mostly gone.

Basically have $500,000 in brokerage.  I’m up 676% in the account.  I’m a single guy, that makes about $40k a year.     All my holdings are big tech, spy and Schd.  Really no fat.   I thought about selling off some holdings but the taxes will hurt me since I don’t make a lot.  Someone suggested I use Margin loans and hold onto my holdings.   I’m on Merrill edge so it looks like my rate will be around 13.13 APY.   That’s a lot to me.  Seems like margin loans are primarily used for short term gains, and Im not a short term guy.     

Is there any reasons why I should really think about using margin loans?  Having to pay 13% a year when that’s basically what the market returns, is a big red flag for me.

Just pay it imo.; Just pay your taxes it's not a big deal. You don't have to sell everything at once either.; Respectfully, you’re nowhere near the amount of capital required to buy borrow die

If you’d prefer to pay less taxes, just wait for the stock price to go down or crash so you have no profit to pay taxes on 

If that sounds stupid, that’s because it is. Just pay the damn taxes. It’s like asking for a lower paycheck to pay lower taxes; Just keep it simple. If you’re ready to sell then sell. Financial chicanery usually never works out. Talk to a accountant instead of Reddit as well; Classic case of tax tail wagging the dog. Look up what your income limits are and sell under that if you're trying to sell under that and pay little in taxes.

Taxes are sometimes a good problem to have (e.g. you made money). Tax code is preferential to long term gains, so really, you're realizing most of what you earned (i.e. you're not going to lose 50% to Uncle Sam).

In other words: just sell and pay a few bucks in taxes if it comes down to it. You have the advantage of timing right now in that a new tax year starts in a week.; If you make 40k you can realize about 20k in gains a year without paying any tax. If I were you I'd sell the least profitable stocks that realize 30k of gains (go over a bit to make sure you use all 0% and just pay 15% on a little extra) now, and again in January for 2025. ; Sell and just save some for taxes.. it's thar simple. Don't try to find the loopholes. You aren't a hedge fund; If you’re up that much just pay the taxes 😂😂; Is your hope that the stocks go down so you pay less taxes?; Capital gains tax is only 15%, just sell and pay it off. Not worth the risk of having a loan; That’s a crazy margin rate though. There are others much less e.g. Interactive Brokers.

Margin only makes sense if you think you can make more in stock appreciation and dividends than the margin rate. 

Plus, it is a risky move to plan on using margin over a long-term. You don’t know future interest rates, and you don’t know the future of the market.

If you sell a modest amount for living expenses, I don’t understand how the taxes would hurt you that much - **especially** if you are only making 40 K, and also if you are selling long-term holdings. 

Please talk to a tax advisor.; If you are wanting to sell vs continuing to
Hold, then sell in early 2025, set aside the money you’ll Owe in capital gains taxes in a HYSA and pay the taxes in 2026 when they’re due.; Your taxes aren’t worse because you don’t make a lot. You have everything backwards. Just sell & pay.; Just set aside enough to pay the extra taxes; I wouldn't, what you can do though is start slowly taking capital gains. So you're up 12x your annual salary more or less. That's a big amount of money. Look at where your tax rates will be. Start taking long-term capital gains in portions and maximize your tax rates, roll money into the s&p 500. 

You've already had extremely outsized returns from these individual companies. If you did a back test on the history of America with companies that have really run, other than Berkshire hathway, none of them just kept going.

Your situation is the perfect low tax situation. Talk to a professional.; Figure out what your 2024 taxable income will be after all deductions, prior year losses, etc.  

Subtract that number from $47,025

Sell enough stock so that your capital gain from that sale will equal or be just a bit less than that number. Your sale of the stock will not be taxed at all- as long as the lots you sell are LTCG. 

For example: 47,025 - income of 40,000= 7,025
You can now realize $7,025 GAIN from stock with zero additional tax
I.e. stock that you purchased for 1,000 is sold for 8,025= 7,025 capital gain
Each year you can do this with zero additional taxes, but the 47k number increases every year. 
If you want to sell more, re-invest only 85%of the gains, since you will be taxed 15% of the GAINS (not the sale) of any gains+income between 47,025 up to 518,900. Keep the 15% in a high yield savings or another easy to access investment.; Don't fear paying long-term capital gains. It's likely 15% for you. 

The market can easily shift that much to the negative, and then you're stuck with a margin debt. 

My advice is to just realize the gains you need and stick a portion of it away to pay the taxes.

At your income level your portfolio is impressive. Kudos 👏; A margin loan is borrowing against the underlying security, so the way I understand them is you aren't selling. It is like taking a out a line of credit against your home. That rate is rough, so I wouldn't even think about it.

If you want to 'rebalance' then sell and pay the taxes. While it is never a great idea to have all your equity tied up in a couple stocks (since anything could happen to drop it 10-20% in a trading day) you have to analyze the company and investment.

Mates correct me if I misunderstood anything.; First. Do basic math. One years interest is only slightly below the total tax you would pay.


Also total tax only equivalent to about a 15% market correction.


You can also create capital gains, and use proceeds to fund a 401k, pretax. Income tax rates are quite a bit higher than capital gains, therefore you can sell, create liquidity, diversify, etc....; Sell gradually as you need the cash, to use multiple years allowances.

And also, the cost of a margin loan goes to making someone else money, the cost of paying tax goes to the country and helping other people and contributing to shared services and utilities.

Sure, paying tax can be galling but you can manage your tax exposure and still contribute to the country you live in.; Don’t forget state taxes on capital gains; Just pay your taxes. Don't complicate things. You're up all that money - money you didn't have. Just pay your damn taxes and enjoy the money.; That margin interest is super high - don’t do that!

Trouble is when they drop….; You should be able to negotiate. I think my rate is around 7% on fidelity. Still not great though.; You probably should rebalance the portfolio!; Are you expecting to die tomorrow and get step up in basis? /s

Like many others have said, just sell some of your holdings each year at 0-15% tax brackets.  If you want, every year just buy it back and rotate lot numbers to always be selling at 0-15% tax brackets.  

Really no excuse not to use up the 0% tax bracket.; What are you trying to do? Why would you ever do something dumb like a margin loan at 13% APY?; Sell only what you need or want to invest in something else. Eat the tax. Not worth the headache of avoiding.

Otherwise, open a Roth IRA and load it with 7,000 a year in tax free long term gains once you're 59 1/2.; Ok dumb question ? Say I put in 25 k my stock goes to 100 k  , when I’m taking out money the first 75 k is always the taxable? What if I take out my 25 k original ! I shouldn’t need to pay any tax this year cause it’s my original investment ! C or No ?; Why isn't this in an IRA or 401k?!; what's the reason for selling? Is it just to free up some cash? Taxes are pretty minor for long term gains and you can hold back the cash to pay them (if you even have any). 

If you want to just lock in some gains, as someone else suggested, selling covered calls until you get called away is the way to go. You'll get some extra profits no matter what you do.; it does not seem you have money in Roth IRA. Why don't you move securities into Roth IRA, then rebalance.; Margin, like options, is a mistake from the start. If I wanted day trading to feel like I got drunk and fucked with my money every day, I'd do margins or options because that's what it's like; Not sure if it’s possible, but can you somehow roll your portfolio into a Roth IRA?; Good shit dude on having that ratio between stocks and income. You should make more my brother.; Sell 25% of your shares each quarter if you want to. Eventually you will sell them and pay taxes on them.; You have 500k in collateral and Merrill is offering a 13% margin rate? That's asinine. I've never traded on margin and won't even think about now.; Retired Wall Streeter here who owns several household tech names all up 10X, 15X, etc. (nice problem to have, isn't it? LOL).

Long term capital gains taxes is only 15% for someone in your tax bracket, so it's really not much of a hit. If you're looking to sell part of your long positions for purposes of diversification to take some concentration risk off the table, then paying a little LT gain tax is a smart move. BTW, if you own anything currently that's at a loss, you could sell that position in the same tax year as your winners to get some offsetting tax benefit.

Not sure if you're making charitable contributions at this stage, but you can also gift shares of appreciated stock to individuals, churches and/or legit charities of your choice as well. Lots of folks do this in lieu of writing checks out of their checking accounts.

I wouldn't use margin loans unless it's a last resort...and for then, only a short period of time. Back in the day, I knew of a few wealth managers who suggested taking out margin loans of 6% annually on their clients' equity portfolios to generate a ""tax-free"" source of income. The problem with the strategy is that markets don't go up 10% every year without surprising selloffs. I wicked downturn can destroy capital like nobody's' business in a heavily margined portfolio.

For a small percentage of your total portfolio (up to 20% or so), the odds of you getting margined out are slim to none, but once you keep leveraging up beyond that you subject yourself to bigtime risk should a Black Swan event occur.

The fact that you already understand and see the Big Red Flag here has already answered your own question.; What do you want the money for?

And it's only the money your investment has gained, the appreciation, that is being taxed anyway.  You're making money hand over fist.

It’s leverage and can cut both ways. But the rates they are quoting you seem absurd. It should be half that. 
Then, sell whatever you can/want and stay at a low tax rate.; It should be a red flag. Don't do it. Why are you thinking about selling? Do you need the money? If not, don't sell. If you do, only sell what you need and pay the 15% tax.; I'd say no to the margin loans. Your account size does not justify it. The ends do not justify the means. I also recommend getting a good CPA. 

Which also opens the door to which tax rate you fall into? You might qualify for a 0% or 15% rate in which case, just pay it. 

If you have a high income:

Be sure to ask your CPA about what your long-term goals are because that'll make it easier to review your options. 

Everything from using a charitable trust or a corporate structure that allows you to use businesses ""expenses"" to offset your taxable ""income"" [if you catch my drift], or utilizing a many other methods to offset the tax implications. 

At the end of the day it all depends on your end goal. 

Personal opinion:

Low income and paying long-term cap tax - just sell it. 

Moderate income - consider getting a CPA, just sell it. 

High income - get a CPA and set up a structure that allows you to EtHiCaLlY use your ""losses"" to offset your ""gains"". The purpose of the structure is to give you more tax flexibility. 

I'm no pro and I may be wrong on many points. I usually just let my CPA & corp. attorney handle everything. Leave the professional work to the professionals and all that.

Edit: not to make things political but a lot of HNW individuals you see (Rump, Musk, etc.) use a system that is exclusive to individuals who have a level of assets of a certain type and wealth that you (probably) do not.

Stay the fuck away from those loans. If you need to rebalance, do rebalance and pay the taxes as necessary.

Yes? Just sell only as much as you need and prefer to sell your bad investments to reduce the tax burden. Don't take a margin loan 

A loan should only be used as a tool to fulfill some end goal which results in a greater upside than the cost of the loan and you can afford to lose what you are risking.

The question at the end of the day isn't whether or not you should be paying taxes, you will have to pay that eventually to tap into your profits.. the real question is whether or not you have an opportunity to grow that money elsewhere. The opportunity cost of not selling can be significant.

If there is a better place to move the asset, then realize it and pay the taxes.; I have a much lower rate on my SLOC, securities backed line of credit.  You should apply for something like that.

E*trade approved me in minutes, easiest access to cash I ever had.; You could start selling calls on those stocks an year out at 30 delta or approximately 15% above current market price. This will supplement your income because you can withdraw premium right away; Margin loans would be foolish for someone in your position. Just start selling small amounts each year and pay the taxes (if any). You're in a low tax bracket, so you should be doing this whether you need the money or not. Just sell and then reinvest the money if you don't need it for living expenses. Check with a tax or financial advisor to come up with a long-term plan.; Too many questions unanswered.

1.  Capital gains tax is tiered based on income.  Talk to a CPA to find out how much you can sell without triggering the next tier.

2.  Merrill Edge’s borrowing rate at 13% is horrible.  Try moving your assets to Wealthfront (5.5% borrowing rates) or Interactive Brokers (same), or maybe even Schwab or E-Trade for better costs.  

3. Margin or non-purpose loans are great for short term borrowing when you make more money than you do.  If your capital gains rate is less than 10%, sell your stock.  Conversely, these loans make sense for people who make a lot.  For example, the top capital gains rate in California is ~38% for people that make roughly more than $600k.  If these people can borrow against their assets/stock for 5%, then they have 7.5 years to repay the loan using their income streams that are already taxed (ie w2 wages or self employment).  In 7.5 years, stocks have the potential to double, so wealth could double and they paid no taxes beyond what they were going to anyways.  

4.  I don’t believe we know what your goals are.  What are your plans for the money?  Are you simply looking to diversify or are you looking to buy a house/make a similarly large purchase?  That could change the strategy as well. 

In your situation, these paths mostly lead to selling if your income is that low, but check with a cpa or ask the ai robot at turbotax to confirm. 

Good luck!; Pay your taxes

You can minimize your tax burden which an advisor/accountant can help with, but you will pay taxes nonetheless.; 15% cap gains tax is reasonable, just sell and reinvest. Don't overthink this.

Pay whatever the cap gains tax is, it's high absolute but not high in relative terms. 
The market won't rally like '23-24 anymore and there's a reasonable chance of a correction, the magnitude of such a drawdown is roughly what you would pay in taxes. No one ever lost money taking chips off the table while in profit, but waiting in an overvalued market, that could backfire.; Check the capital gains tax details. Some people here reported that you only pay tax if you earn above a certain amount. It sounds like you may be below that.

NOW, selling a stock will trigger a GAIN in income, so do the math accordingly to see how much you can safely sell without much of a tax liability. Maybe consider doing this annually until you feel comfortable with your rebalance.

I ran into this in 2020 when I was furloughed but I realized that in the sale I could just put aside a little bit of cash to cover the tax. Sure it’s not ideal and it hinders growth a bit, but I just did it for convenience and simplicity at the time.; Don’t take a margin loan. That is a tax avoidance tool for very rich people.

Barring those unusual income/tax future events, you could just take the gains gradually over numerous years to help optimize.  The portions you sell will more than fund the smaller tax liability.; Who tf told you to do that, absolutely braindead advice. If you need to sell, you need to sell. If you don't, then maybe it's worth selling them off slowly to stay below the tax threshold - although personally with valuations where they are I wouldn't want to be taking 10 years to sell out of big tech.; That rate is outrageous.

You aren’t losing money, you made a huge profit, just accept that taxes are part of that.; Use IBKR or Robinhood to get your margin loans down in the 5% range (that's also deductible as investment interest).

IBKR also allows ""portfolio margin"" for higher allowable leverage levels. To be clear I'm not suggesting to be a degen, but to have more cushion for swings.

Also, I wouldn't even consider borrowing against stocks unless you simultaneously have more stable assets somewhere else that can be used to cushion your account during volatility.; Margin loan only if it's a bridge situation.  You don't want to be on Margin long term.; sell a box spread; you’re going to get taxed on it at some point, why does it matter now or later? just sell what you want, keep some as cash for taxes/whatever, put the rest in s&p index and watch it grow to a few million in 25+ years.; You could look into Section 351 of the tax code. Here's a quick description of how it can work. 

>A section 351 ETF conversion refers to a tax-related mechanism under U.S. tax law, specifically Section 351 of the Internal Revenue Code. This mechanism allows for the transfer of assets (such as stocks, securities, or other property) to a corporation without recognizing a taxable gain or loss, provided certain conditions are met.
>
>In the context of an ETF, a 351 exchange would typically involve the transfer of assets to the ETF in exchange for shares in that ETF without triggering a taxable event.
>
>In other words, you can contribute an investment portfolio and “seed” the launch of an ETF, and receive a diversified ETF in exchange

But if not, taxes or interest are your options. If you're responsible, you're talking a few thousand in ""fees"" (taxes or interest) which arguably is worth it if you ""ain't got it"" in cash up front.; I would recommend selling covered calls- free income and you effectively would only sell if the stock hits your target price above the current price, so it’s better than immediately selling if your are on the fence.; Terrible idea.

You are probably not eligible for portfolio margin with your account size and income; Don’t sell until it’s enough to move to an income strategy and you can replace your income with it.; With a $40k income, OP would be in the 0% long-term capital gains bracket for a good chunk of any sales, and only 15% above that.

Simple math makes this one pretty clear.; Unless you're comfortable with the value of your account going down 50%, take some gains off the table and diversify a bit.

So any income over that amount is subject to an extra 3.8% tax; Not exactly. The 47k is taxable income, so the standard deduction and or other deductions would give 15k of headroom above that.; He needs to consider state taxes too.; Only 7 k would be 0% capital gains, if he made 0’dollars then the 47 would be 0% fyi; Sell only 7k worth of shares each year.; Bruhhh like my sentiment just pay the taxes.

If you buy $25k of that same stock and it goes to $100k, but only sell $25k, you will end up selling 250 ($100 each) shares which you originally bought for $6250 ($25 each) and gained $18750 of profit which can be taxed. How much you are actually taxed depends on your income, how long you held the stock, etc.; This makes no sense. It’s all percentages.

This person makes $40,000 a year. They’re gonna be paying virtually zero taxes on LTCG, and it’s a week left in 2024 so there’s a lot of tax planning to be done even if they were gonna incur a “relatively large” liability.; First of all if this person only makes $40,000 a year from earned income they are absolutely not paying any taxes on long-term capital gains up to a certain amount. They should be realizing that amount. This is called tax gain harvesting. 

Second, the standard deduction increases annually along with the tax brackets. On this website, people often complain that their wages do not keep up with inflation.

According to the hive mind, this person will be making less and less each year and therefore be able to take advantage of a slightly larger amount of tax-free, long-term capital gain realization.

# Idea

Stochastic is a momentum indicator, very similar to another indicators (like RSI).  
As the study shows, it is very good for entry. But to use it for exit, you need to trade Trend Following.  
We will look at how it can be used for Mean Reversion.

The indicator produces two lines and takes two periods. Unfortunately we will not use both, as the second one is just an average for the first one. ('D' line is not used in strategy).

*The strategy buys only if there are no open trades. That is, there can be only 1 trade at a time.*  
*The strategy does not have a shortsell trades as instrument is often in the uptrend.*

***Inputs:***

1. K\_Period: **1**/2/3
2. LowTh: 10/15/20/**25**/35/45/50

*D\_Period=1*

**Buy Rules:** Stoch(K\_Period, D\_Period, Slowing).Fast < LowTh  
*Fast is 'K' Line*  
**Filter**: Close > SMA(200) (Optionally)

# Conclusions

1. Stochastic is perfect for entry, but bad for exit.
2. Works well on all MR instruments
3. 76% winrate, which is pretty normal for Mean Reversion.
4. The strategy has almost no optimization, but it works with the same parameters on all MR instruments.
5. You are free to choose when to exit the position.
6. Simple risk management is already doing more than the return of US100 with much lower drawdowns (7+ return / dd ratio)
7. Sharpe Ratio > 1, which is very rare for MR strategies.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Trading) if you have any questions or concerns.*; I see you used SQX for this research. I'm a fan of the platform myself. 

You and I both know there is more to the story here 😉 

With that said, you should show the fuller picture. Include the robustness tests results that SQX generates.

How does this hold up with monte Carlo simulations? What about parameter sensitivity? How's the WFA look? All reds with spots of green? Or all green?

Try to be fully transparent. A lot of people here don't know any better and will actually go and try to trade this.; Use a a less leveraged instrument. Problem solved.; Thinking of getting Metatrader just to try some of these on some accounts of my own.; interesting, thank you for posting.; Your task as a trader, is to improve & simplify your approach for efficiency while maintaining an up trending equity curve while avoiding the draw down that leads to RoR. Risk of Ruin No one elses result matter as you’re not them, not likely trading the same system, the exact same way. Even if 100 people get the exact same trade it will yield 100 different results, this has been proven in simulation and in real time trading environments. The only trend that matters is the trend of your equity curve!; Thanks for sharing!🔥; Nice, I use a similar strategy running calendar spreads on futures for risk management. ; Stoch is great for entries on Stocks and stock indexes. But I agree that using it for exit is bad; Your parameters (Stoch 1,1,1) < 25 seem to equate to IBS < 25

I eyeballed my tradingview chart and I am not seeing profitable months in July and August  2024; How about some examples of those number of trades (with pics including indicators). Thanks; So basically it's more about the crossing of the fast Vs slow stochastic. When you say no take profit you mean you choose in stochastic crossing on the other side?; Seems dope; If 826% yearly was possible you'd put every hedge fund out of business - what do you know that they don't? Why aren't we all sitting at home algo trading?; Which library did you use to create those charts?; Nice. But I am not statistically trained and am confused, if you say US100 is in an uptrend, which it is, then it tends to behave more like stocks, and it is different from FX and commodities, because mean reversion works for these instruments. So why would mean reversion work in this case?; This is good stuff, very good stuff.  

I'd love to hop on a call with you sometime to pick your brain because I'm trying to develop a similar algorithm for evaluating traders' performance over time. Each successful trader's confidence interval will be determined by recent performance, thus introducing a human element to the equation.  All the successful trader's trades will be made, but with a weighting according to their confidence score.  Thus resulting in better performance overall.; Thank you for posting!

Adding my experience playing with this idea:

Implemented in Tradingview's strategy tester, on a daily timeframe, where it has a positive win rate and profit factor  (even better on the weekly!)

US100 w. Deep Backtesting on D := 70% profitable , 1.034 profit factor 

TSLA D := 67%, 1.578 PF

GOOG D := 69%, 1.68

I do think it has potential and I will start with a small account and see where it goes :); What kind of education do you recommend to start working on this kind of business?; Such strategies often fail on Monte Carlo because it have high winrate and big losses (unlike Trend Following where small winrate, small losses, big profits). 

Monte Carlo is more suitable when you have equal profits and losses for each trade (takeprofit + stoploss).

I usually bring a list of parameters and values, you can see it in the previous posts. So all strategies pass the sensitivity test for parameters successfully. Especially where one indicator is used.

Walk Forward is doing a great job.

In general, I initially test a strategy on 1-3 years of data. Then I test it on all the other years. Besides, the “Return /DD Ratio” parameter is important to me. As you can see, this strategy also works on other markets with the same inputs.

As practice shows such strategies rarely pass all tests. It will all fail, as this is the nature of mean reversion and trading without stop loss.

This only means that the strategy can be worse than others.  
But it does not mean that the strategy does not work.; Great idea; Great words; Glad it helped; Yes, using stochastics to exit leads to longer trades; may be good for planned exits too. ( and further, with contingencies and insurance/hedge etc); Trading View is a bit different and does not allow you to set the parameters you need. In Metatrader and Quant X it is possible.

Try experimenting with Stochastic, change its parameters and Threshold for you. Try also Sotch RSI.   
  
Not compared to IBS, but many strategies correlate. That's why I try to make different position closing rules; Next time I will try to add indicators to the picture via Trading View. Thanks for advice; No. It's not about crossing stochastic lines. Its' about using main line.   
No take profit = no limit order.  
**Close Rule**: Close > High\[1\]  
*Yesterday's close was higher than the day before that*; If you know how to use information and check it for truthfulness, that's always cool!; If you're talking about prop firms, they have drawdown limits for customers.

To make 826% yearly you have to put up with -80% drawdown (that's what you missed when you were admiring the beautiful equity chart).

Even to do 20% yearly you have to put up with -15% drawdown, which is shown in the Overview picture.

You can safely trade on FTMO with -5% drawdown, but then the profit will be less. I don't want to lose my account because my drawdown is lower than I am allowed.

I have all funds distributed between 10+ accounts, I do not use stop losses, but I am insured that my account will explode or be deleted.; It's not library. It's programm called ""Strategy Quant X""; That's the nature of the instrument. Statistically top stocks and indices are mean revertable. Forex too, but there you need to use the Shortsell trades. I have attached to my previous posts a video where a person demosntrates working on forex; Good thoughts.; Thank you for sharing your results!; I think YouTube videos is enough. Algo trading ideas, strategies. Tutorials for you language and software; Thanks for the follow up.

I was just giving examples of robustness tests -- indeed, not all tests are applicable to all strategies.

The broader point I was making was about effectively empowering the audience.

You took several screenshots, but seemed to leave out the ones that actually mattered most -- the robustness tests; one of the very things that makes SQX such a great research tool.

IMHO, whenever possible, one should try to share the whole picture.; Will contact you if you are open to a tutorial or questions.; Thank you & Happy Holidays to you & yours!; Would you recommend trading this with some leverage? 

My risk tolerance allows for a 50% drawdown on my account in unrealized losses.

Let’s say I want to start out with a 1k account would it be reasonable to trade 1 or 0,5 lots per trade or something else?

If this would be profitable, what ‘formula’ should I use in order to determine how much lots i should use?

Thanks in advance; Buy doesnt even know the difference between hedge fund and prop firm.; Ooh ok; I immediately wrote “if you mean prop firms”. I'm not interested in Hedge Funds.

Is there a point in investing in emerging markets?,"Many people invest in emerging markets with the rationale that these countries have a huge growth potential. But my rationale says that even if these economies grow, it's the companies from the developed world that will benefit the most. For example, as poor countries gain more disposable incomes, they'll be able to buy more expensive products like iPhones and MacBooks. So this will help the Apple stock grow not the stock of some company in these emerging economies. That's not to say those companies won't grow at all, sure they will with increased internal demand, but the developed world has more to gain from the growth of the emerging economies. Also, most internal growth will come from international companies opening their manufacturing plants in emerging economies like Apple and Samsung manufacturing in India. So again it only makes sense to invest in developed world.

What do you guys think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hjg7uw/is_there_a_point_in_investing_in_emerging_markets/,64,2024-12-21 19:43:32,"The point of investing in emerging markets is for diversification. International equities as a whole are imperfectly correlated with U.S. equities, but emerging markets specifically are even more so.

Take the 2000s as an example…

The S&P 500 returned approximately -9.1% cumulatively, while international developed markets returned ~17.5% and emerging markets returned a whopping ~154.3%.

Contrary to popular belief, U.S. equities do not outperform International long-term. While U.S. stocks have been outperforming for the past ~15 years, historically international and U.S. stocks have exchanged in periods of outperformance lasting 10-15 years. 

Nobody knows the future… that’s why we should diversify.; USA was once an emerging market in a world of European superpowers. 

Diversify.; If a small country grows, which company’s profit will likely increase more? Apple (0.05% of revenues coming from that country) vs a local construction company (100% revenues from that country).; Everything you just said is known information priced into the market. If you want to concentrate in US large cap growth/tech, [at today’s valuations](https://x.com/benjaminwfelix/status/1865123503659188719?s=46), you can eventually learn the lesson of how outsized revenue growth does not equate to outsized stock returns yourself.; Nope. Capitalism is global now. And in capitalism, it's a winners-take-all endgame.

US companies already have their tentacles in every corner of the world, essentially becoming multi-national corporations that eat up local/emerging competition. AKA virtually unchecked monopolies.

There's virtually no way for developing countries to gain enough momentum to take down the big guys, due to lack of vertical integration, inability to get the best pricing on raw resources (due to lack of volume), lack of brand recognition/loyal userbase, and being unable to compete with the existing mass infrastructures that global companies have already built for themselves.; They theoretically pay a risk premium. They also have low correlation to the S&P 500 so they're excellent for diversification. The growth potential is actually irrelevant.; I don’t believe the opportunities are as great as they once were. All of the largest companies in all of the most developed countries are making enormous amounts of cash, and they are looking for investment opportunities. Some companies famously sit on piles of cash, such as Apple, but other companies are taking that cash and investing just like a private investor would do. They’re buying up smaller companies or interests in similar sectors or part of their supply chain in these developed countries, and the financial sector of course you would see loans being given out to those companies in emerging markets, which is a form of investment and therefore investing in the bank itself, could be an opportunity to return from the success of emerging markets tangentially. 

I think it would be very difficult for a retail investor to make a smart choice of which individual company to invest in within any particularemerging market, and even investing in a broadly diversified ETF of the emerging market is a shotgun approach. 

It’s the classic wisdom of when there’s a gold rush you want to be in the business of selling shovels. All of those emerging markets are looking for capital and investment, and the biggest corporations in the world are able to service that need. So you’re chasing an extra few percent for an enormous amount of extra risk. If you’re ok with that - go for it.; Emerging markets are risky and complicated, and involve investing in other currencies and political environments - environments that are not necessarily as business-friendly as the United States. It can take 2 years to register a trademark in Brazil. 

But I think you’re missing a major concept - which is the law of diminishing returns. The more companies grow, the harder it is for them to grow more. Sometimes they run out of “easy” customers and have to work harder to convince more skeptical / stingy potential customers. Or maybe their growth rate is slowed by increasing competition in their space - like Netflix during the streaming wars. Or maybe they become so massive that they can’t adapt quickly enough to capture new opportunities. In 1980, IBM was the biggest company on the planet. But it didn’t adapt, and was overtaken by Apple and Microsoft. Big ships turn slowly. 

Early growth is easy, later growth is hard. And that’s one of the reasons emerging markets can be attractive. Assuming you have a long time horizon and appetite for risk. 

I recommend reading this: 

https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/special-reports/look-forward/emerging-markets-a-decisive-decade; Not really necessary to invest in emerging markets for diversity, since many US companies do business in foreign markets.  (Plus, in recent years US stocks have outperformed foreign. ) But there are some interesting money making opportunities to be had in emerging markets.  I invested in Mercado Libre MELI many years ago with great benefit.  Now I am in NU (south america) SE (southeast Asia) GRAB (southeast asia) that are all involved in developing countries.; Emerging Markets tend to have unstable natural resource based economies, with higher level of corruption. That seems to go with the asset class.

IMO its necessary to be selective and identify the country that is moving into the category of developed market.  

I wouldn't want to buy a broad basket of Emerging Markets just because they are Emerging Markets. Its myth that all emerging markets will become developed markets. Many are always going to be under performing, because of culture, government, education, corruption, civil war, etc.; So there’s this guy, Paul Merriman.  Look up his research on small cap value and growth.; I have my international all in FSPSX (developed countries only). I don't trust emerging markets. That's just based on gut and I could be completely wrong. But either way I don't think it will matter too much if I had put it my international allocation in FTIHX/VXUS vs. FSPSX. Last few years they have performed similarly.; Yes absolutely there is for diversification. A total international index like VTIAX / VXUS is roughly 80% developed non US and 20% Emerging Markets. I am not inclined to have more emerging market exposure than that in my portfolio. If I was I would look at buying IEMG from ishares…; >But my rationale says that even if these economies grow, it's the companies from the developed world that will benefit the most

They will still have some industries that are better served by local companies. There are things like the utilities sector, possibly natural resources, etc.

>but the developed world has more to gain from the growth of the emerging economies

Both established companies from developed countries and upcoming companies from the emerging countries themselves can benefit.

Remember that Taiwan is considered an emerging market and the 9th largest company (by free float market cap) is in Taiwan (https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vtwax#portfolio-composition note that I'm counting Alphabet A & C as the same).

Then you get things like the utilities sector, possibly natural resources, etc.

And it also isn't exactly what companies will grow more, but rather grow compared to what the market was already expecting of them.

Edit: Typos; I've often thought the same thing, and your conclusion will even get stronger over the years (that US-dominated multinational companies will be benefactors of ""international growth"").

ETF's are OK but they're almost always in some kleptocratic bureaucratic companies that were de-nationalized like petrochemicals or banks. For instance, look at the top holdings of EWZ. It's all petro/old bank garbage with the exception of NU. You could have bought just NU by simply following what Buffett does.

The ""but you must invest in international markets to diversify"" mantra doesn't hold us much water now as it did 20 years ago (when intl outperformed US for a hot minute). The large US players are truly huge and their reach, and thus profits, are much larger now than ever.; ""even if these economies grow, it's the companies from the developed world that will benefit the most."" - that's the part that's not true.  We can debate whether emerging markets are worth the risk and whether growth in GDP really equates directly to growth in stock prices but its a given fact that local companies benefit direct and far more than companies from developed worlds.   Those are the companies the locals grew up on, has fond childhood memories about and it's impossible to remove.  100% of their business is tied to that local economy vs sometimes less than 10% for these international expansions.; >For example, as poor countries gain more disposable incomes, they'll be able to buy more expensive products like iPhones and MacBooks.

How exactly did they gain disposable income?  The local economy with local companies improving, expanding?; I got AVUV it's as far as I go; Only if they have a democracy; Yes, EEM (the oldest emerging markets ETF) has delivered a solid  8.38% return since inception in 2003 and is fairly uncorrelated with developed markets.

That's a 9% return if you account for the overpriced 0.70% expense ratio that the fund has (you would use VWO or IEMG today which are both under 10 basis points).; You want to buy LOW and sell HIGH. 

People say “oh, suuuuure. Easy to say, improbable to actually do…”

Look at NVDA vs BABA. Anyone who wants, remind yourself with the bot to look at the performance from here over three years. Or do it with VTI vs VWO. 

Everyone who wants to outperform VOO needs exposure to emerging markets going forward.; I think American companies are too global now to bother.

I’m sure there will be exceptions but it’s not like I’m hurting for American options.  Why bet on the long shot when the favorites are available to buy?; I like FSPSX; One should argue it’s actually the mix of risk and diversification not the diversification alone. It’s also a bet on higher growth as their economies develop and materialize higher performing businesses with a more technologically sophisticated workforce over time ; It does not seem to work anymore. Right now everything goes to US stocks. Just look how badly Mexico and Brazil were beaten up. China is fighting with the 62% retracement of the recent upmove. 
Yes there will be a time where emerging markets will come back but for now it does not look like it.; VXUS 10-year  return: +19%.  Inflation ate it up and more.  A lot of money not gained with this perennial loser.; In my opinion no. There are great opportunities in the US markets without having to risk currency crises or unstable governance overseas. For international exposure you could consider US manufacturers who may soon be expanding overseas such as Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation.

The incoming administration has stated support for their nascent ‘flying car’ industry and NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration is working closely with them both. Morgan Stanley has forecast the Advanced Air Mobility market could be worth $1 trillion by 2040.

In my opinion both companies offer great potential over the next ten to fifteen years but also as potential short term gains if the share prices ride up as worldwide commercial launches hopefully take place in 2025/26. That said they are more risky investments than your average company or an Index tracker for example.

I have recently setup a sub for discussing Joby r/JOBY_Investors and also recently joined another new sub for r/ACHR_Investors.

Good luck whatever you choose to do!; [deleted]; Every time I see a post asking why invest in non US equities, I buy 100 VXUS.; >While U.S. stocks have been outperforming for the past ~15 years, historically international and U.S. stocks have exchanged in periods of outperformance lasting 10-15 years.

Except there’s always one component of this that’s always ignored: Magnitude. Your goal as an investor isn’t the product of binary win/loss periods. 

The “golden” example in favor of exUS is always the “Lost Decade”. Everyone loves to use it when describing exUS’s benefit. Well here’s how well that went:

* US: -0.62% CAGR

* exUS: +1.74% CAGR

Well that’s technically a win, and as a bonus I won’t even mention the volatility.

How about the next 10?

* US: +13.17%

* exUS: +4.66%

Seems a ten year period of insignificant outperformance didn’t really compete with the divide over the next 10. Either way, all this theory is basically trashed with rolling returns of any period size of your choosing. 

exUS is a value trap. Has been that way for nearly 40 years. The top exUS industries are closer to the US in 2000 than today. If you want banks, snack foods, pharma, and gas…you can get exposure to those things without the currency risk.; The world is more globalized since 2000, and we have entered and remain in an rich/big/strong environment where existing global companies can push out any newcomers. The EU is starting to put some pressure on monopolies, but otherwise few governments seem to care.

With that said, I keep ~10% of my portfolio in VXUS for diversification.; Great answer. I agree with this; True; Bingo. And back then European investors probably thought ""why invest in those colonial upstarts when the East India Company is right here?"" History has some hard lessons about underestimating emerging powers.; The US began as a colony of the most powerful economy in the world, with no significant competition at all to pursue resource extraction from basically an entire continent. 

There are no other modern emerging markets where this is also true. 

The closest rehash will be space colonization if that ever happens. ; I agree, even if in absolute terms their logic was accurate, even a modest increase in business can be a large percentage increase for businesses in developing countries.  So I don't agree with their analysis from that perspective.

But the question you should really be asking yourself is if you, the foreign investor, are going to be the one to see the full benefit of that growth.  One of the reasons that emerging markets are not already as developed is that they often have less stable governments, less mature institutions, more corruption, etc.  They may not be committed to providing a level playing field for foreign shareholders to extract value from their economy.  You might find yourself in situations where the developing countries economy has strong growth, the companies you invest in have solid growth and profits, and yet for one reason or another your investment returns are not always what you'd expect.  There may be obstacles and challenges to realizing your gains that you wouldn't expect from a developed nation with a more robust stock market.

I think it's worth investing some moderate amount (no more than 20% or so) for the sake of diversification, but would be wary of having too much exposure, especially exposure to any one particular developing country.  If you're investing in ETFs, you want to look at what the allocation is to different countries.  You might find that an ""emerging market"" ETF is actually 80% China, for example, so it's not nearly as much global diversification as you would have thought.; You're not going to invest in that local construction company with an emerging markets ETF or mutual fund. You're just not. You'll be stuck with some petro-state garbage, banks, and maybe local retail or a cell phone carrier. 

Finding the diamond in the remote rough is the work of actively managed funds, which are particularly hated here in r/investing .; Specific examples of fast growing companies in emerging markets: NU, MELI. They are unlikely to be disrupted by multinational companies and benefit from growing economies in Latin America.; This rationale has nothing do with the present valuations. I know the market is overvalued. Buffet is sitting on the biggest cash pile of all time. It's common knowledge.; This.  Large US companies are already global and if there's a large profit to be made they'll jump on it.  You're not going to see the next Amazon spring up in Mali...sorry that's how our world works now. 

I don't think international, specifically emerging markets, will outperform US but that's my take.; I think at the moment what we're seeing is ""the winner taking it all"" - and one wonders what will happen if more and more of the world's money is shifted into US equities.


Arguably - diversifying is preparation for when the bubble bursts: because that money will have to go somewhere.; I didn't realize GRAB was listed on the NASDAQ. I might look into it, especially since Uber pulled out of that region entirely (and sold the business to them).; I dont trust them either, they have too much corruption and political instability; What if I wanted to invest specifically in African companies?; US companies operate more and more internationally, so one could think, the are somewhat diversified already. It's like global companies chose to place their headquarters in the U.S. for specific advantages like regulation and investment opportunity.; By MNCs from US opening their offices in India for example. I am a Software Engineer and the top payers are companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon. And now Apple, Samsung have started to manufacture there as well.; Lol that's even worse. As soon as these companies grow and become mid cap they are out of the portfolio. How will you ride the growth wave like that?; EEM: 1-year return:  +8%    
10-year : +7%    
From inception (2003):  +291%     
QQQ from 2003:  +1,620%; Yes, but what about emerging market ETFs?; Your returns must be terrible lol; It's asked so often, you must have bought millions of shares by now.; Up 2.28% in the last year.  My savings account has a better return lol.; Your argument is that the last 20-30 years of US and exUS returns should be expected to repeat just because they are what happened before? Despite the fact that US returns in this period are an historical outlier and [US valuations have been pushed to near record levels](https://x.com/benjaminwfelix/status/1865123503659188719?s=46)? Thinking that you know more than the market and that recent past returns can be projected forward are two of the most classic blunders in investing. Your goal should be reliable good returns, not highest possible returns with unnecessary risks, and country diversification is always a more reliable strategy in an unknown future.; Europeans were very keen to invest in the colonies at the time. It was how they made money. ; Yep. I would 100% rather have an investment in a $1M company that grows to $5M, than in a $1B company that grows to 1.008B even though that’s twice as much growth, the first company grew by $4M and the 2nd grew by $8M.

Big companies grow in value when they increase profitability of products. Small companies also have massive opportunity to grow by growing their market share. If you have 50% of the market, it takes a lot of effort to grow to 55%, and have 10% growth in sales. If you have 0.5% of the market, it takes one viral YouTube video to grow to 1% and have 100% growth in sales.

It’s betting on the long shot at the racetrack. Growth potential means that l it has a chance of paying off really really big, and much less of a chance to lose your shirt than, for example, betting on options.; Ahh… a case for AVDV and AVES! Hehehe. 10% each and call it a day for international diversification?; Your rationale as I understand it is that developed market companies will benefit most from the growth of emerging market economies. That doesn’t seem like something the market isn’t already acutely aware of or particularly different from the last four centuries of public stock investing. I think you could get yourself into a lot of trouble with narrative bias and authority bias trying to weight your portfolio based on how you personally think returns will play out or how Berkshire Hathaway is positioned. Obvious information confers no advantage; South Korea and Taiwan prove you wrong though. They were 3rd world countries in 1960. They spawned TSMC, Samsung, LG, Kia and Hyundai; I think you could see countries blocking the largest US corporations. No Facebook or Google. No Amazon. Those companies, especially Meta, are trying to be the layer on the Internet that everything is built on, but that only works as long as they're allowed to. I could see after increasing election interference regions like the EU simply blocking them and letting homegrown, regulated ones take their place.


No reason Mali can't do the same. They may be regionally limited but after 2016 the people have voted for more protectionism, more national options. So I think we'll have it. ; That's my thinking.

I can't see the emerging market developing a next Microsoft, Google , apple , etc. And if they try these companies will buy them out .; https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1hjs94u/based_on_rural_reach_indias_tiktok_substitutes/


Related to my other comment. I don't think a company will come out of India to take the US market, but there will be growth opportunities in countries like this with growing middle classes. 


Then again TikTok came out of China and nobody expected that. ; AFK or EZA; AVUV is basically the ETF version of DFSVX which has returned 11.55% since inception in 1993.

Source: https://www.dimensional.com/us-en/funds/dfsvx/us-small-cap-value-portfolio-i; It's my Hedge against VOO which is 50% of my portfolio.; Emerging markets ETF's are usually trash. For every gem you'll get three Evergreens or some mismanaged oil company/bank.

Edit: prove me wrong with recent data, not 30-50 years ago.; [deleted]; He mostly keeps his eyes shut.; exUS has worse absolute and *risk-adjauted* returns, revenues are global and only homogenizing further, and historical performance is simultaneously the reason I should expect an exUS resurgence, but not expect US outperformance…

Comparing the two’s valuations is pointless because (again) exUS is a value trap in aggregate. Plus you’re taking on various country risks that don’t exist in the US…including currency, lack of stockholder protections, and no legal right to ownership. 

International investing is sold as a no brainer, set and forget product…and sold it has been. Jack Bogle was totally against it, but Fidelity and Vanguard made it cheap and they’ve been pushing it ever since. 

Again, you’re free to rummage the holdings and assess if there’s anything there you simply can’t capture domestically do without. You’re free to paint a bull picture based on the valuation, but you need to also ask yourself why it’s sat that low for so long if it’s the next no-brainer.  Frankly, I can’t really find more than a few things I wouldn’t qualify as trash.

I dont really want Novo, Shell, Nestle, and Astrazenca in my top holdings. I dont hate ASML or TSMC. I want nothing out of China or South Korea. Easy choice to just not partake.; I'm talking about this point forward in time.  Our largest companies are simply too big and powerful.  If you had some start up start killing it in Uruguay, it wouldn't be long before a large company would either come in and take over or buy them out.  The whole set up of the 1960s was completely different.

The modern world was still developing  in the 1900's but it's hard to see this status quo changing much.  The big players are set and the discrepancy between the leading economics and emerging economies is massive in resources, technology,  education, etc.

 There were no companies close to the size of our biggest players back in the 1960s and the dominant sectors today didn't even exist.; South Korea shareholder protections are terrible. Companies can do amazing and the stock will do nothing. This is by design.; You get TSMC in the SP500. The rest you mentioned vacillate from bread winners to dysfunctional basket cases every few years.; Oh my gosh… Samsung?? Hyundai??

Yeah, I’ll take the American companies. You can have the exceptions, I’ll take the rule.; You’re missing the point. If you have $100k to invest, and emerging markets do take off, it IS likely that established companies will take most of that growth, yes. And GOOGL will make an extra $100M and go up 0.1%, but the local companies making an extra $10M might go up 500% because of that.; I'd never bet on India; No one asked about BTC here. That's not part of emerging markets. Think ETFs with stocks in places like Brazil, India, China, etc. (E.g. Vanguard's VWO).; People act like there is no country risk in the US...

I mean, you may be fine for 10 years or maybe the rest of your life. But maybe not. Look back 100 years instead of 20. The UK was sitting pretty sweet. Go back further when the Dutch ruled the world economy.

Recency bias, home bias, endowment effect, Dunning-Krueger, herding, a whole host of cognitive biases are working to blind us.

Bogle incidentally happened to be alive during the American century, when even bonds were great. He said it wasn't necessary, not that he was against it (did advise no more than 20 percent international.) Then again he also failed to follow his own advice several times such as trying to time the market. If you lived Bogle's timeline of course he was prescient but we are living our timeline.; Surely people used the same logic for the East Indies companies back in the day?; To add to your point. Look at the newest big growth area, AI. Who is running it? All the big existing companies.

The only risk I see is if when/if governments get serious about antitrust. The EU has done a little, and the little the US was doing is about to stop. So, party on.; Good point . Didn't think of that .; This is an excellent point. I also like how you just integrated Einstein’s theory of relativity into a global equities debate. Nicely done!; I'd consider a bet on India for India, not India for world economic domination. They are growing their middle class rapidly. ; Why not? They have about 17% of the world’s population with a growing number of highly educated workers.; First, I never even mentioned ‘country’ risk*. I specifically mentioned other categorical risks that are directly verifiable today…and have been for some time. You can throw out every bias you want, but your examples just highlight the nonsense of the “pro” argument and Bogle was making these claims in the 2010s. Not exactly a reflection without modern considerations. 

*Edit: I did write country risk, but meant “country specific” risks. Not broad “country risk” that pertains mostly to EM. Lack of right to ownership and non-existent shareholder protections are literally the biggest concerns I have with the countries I would otherwise like the most*

Why is a stance that these objective issues are a problem any more biased than someone’s position that they’re actually not…when 30+ years of returns have yet to support it? It amazing how many people can see the outcome of a generational divide and continue to profess it will end, without the ability to pinpoint a catalyst beyond P/E, which is a terrible metric to throw your weight behind. 

> If you lived Bogle's timeline of course he was prescient but we are living our timeline

There’s absolutely zero need to examine the world through the lens of colonialism (which you basically did) but that’s sadly not a rare argument. If things get better outside the US, it’s not like these changes ripple through the market overnight. If the problems I see disappear, I can change strategy with plenty of time. 

As it sits today, economic outlooks and quality of companies are miles apart (I can’t stress enough to look at the industries you’re counting on). Maybe in another 30 years that will change, but I plan to be long retired by then.; We're comparing apples to oranges.  Saying because it worked like this in the past so that's how it'll work in the future is very similar to the caution ""past performance is not indicative of future results"" on every prospectus.

We live in a world with a massive discrepancy between 1st world and 3rd world.  1st world countries are now developing AI and Quantum Computing.  I think it's a bit of a gamble to think that a major development in those sectors is going to come from a country that doesn't have reliable electricity, internet, or a functional government. 

It's not totally impossible but highly unlikely.  I'd put my money on the most advanced economies.  US, maybe some Asian exposure. 

If others disagree and want to invest in emerging, by all means and I really do wish you (and those countries) the best! It would have positive effects for everyone...more trade, more entrepreneurs and developers etc etc; Keep in mind that many of the new companies putting AI to use in real world applications are Chinese (but just getting started). I believe the Chinese are also graduating far more skilled workers and engineers from universities on an annual basis than we are in the US. Their workforce is highly skilled in CS and CE. They also often  work 6 days per week, with longer hours, on average. This is why I’ve been using VEA+VWO at a 1:1 ratio instead of VXUS. I’m betting that some of the Chinese startups are going to make waves. But, a great point was made about US companies potentially gobbling them up. I had not really considered that angle. I recognize that my theory or bet is just that. This is why I don’t recommend my own allocation to newcomers.; Next to the US (chipsets + software), China (an “emerging” country in many ETFs) actually has a highly skilled workforce that will likely revolutionize the **application of** AI in consumer products. And if only they were able to get those NVDA chipsets… they could become the tech super power. 

For this reason I’ve considered a crazy investment in CQQQ, but the risks of their governments interference with markets were just too high for me. 

I carry 10% VEA + 10% VWO for Ex-US diversification. Unfortunately, I still don’t expect them to perform well. 

Very recently, and mostly thanks to Reddit (for better or worse), I’ve thought about swapping out VEA and VWO with AVDV and AVES. But, it’s just an idea. 

Frankly, I’m getting frustrated with myself for constantly tinkering with the Ex-US portion of my portfolio for many years, all the while watching terrible results. Part of me thinks to go 20% VXUS and chill (and accept what may yet again prove to be a continuous drag on total portfolio return), OR just abandon the Ex-US investment altogether like recommended by Buffet for almost all investors and just be ready to ride out the next (eventual) cycle where Ex-US outperforms. So many choices."

P/E Ratios in the Tech Sector,"Alright guys and girls... I'm looking for some of the big investors on here with high 6 or even 7 figure plus portfolios. I'm wondering what folks with a lot more time in the market are thinking about the PE Ratios for some of these tech companies in various ETFs. VGT from Vanguard for example or even VOO/VTI. I'm not too worried about the players like Apple, Microsoft, etc. They have always seemed to have such deamand that they run a PE in the 30s-50s. But some of these companies like AMD at PE 100, Broadcom 170, NVIDIA shooting up into the 50s so quickly with massive investment. Is just limited supply and crazy demand for these shares. Are you concerned as investors? I had to close out portfolios 5 years ago to go back to school and pay for it without taking on debt. I just got back in last year and have 200k in the market and with our income now 600k to 700k per year we intend to keep maxing out everything and also contribute to brokerage accounts.... 200k a year total min with 401ks, Roths, brokerage account.",https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1hiwr1k/pe_ratios_in_the_tech_sector/,9,2024-12-21 00:28:54,"Hi, it depends on your expected time in the market and risk allocation. High P/E ratio tech stocks tend to be very speculative and volatile currently in the market. My personal view is there’s plenty of room for innovation, with growing demands for processing power and novel solutions to modern problems, not to mention the soon-to-be boom in quantum computing. I’m not a fan (at all) of the so-called ‘meme stocks’ or poor financial credentials, so stay well clear of speculation on ‘promising’ companies (aka I don’t listen to the media). I’ve stuck with VOO and Berkshire Hathaway, along with some small individual stock investments (albeit never more than 15% of my stocks&shares portfolio) for a diverse investment strategy, making the most of market upside potential and clear financial strength of specific entities and not had to worry about market volatility. What is it exactly you’re looking for?; I highly doubt the high 7 figure guys are hanging out on Reddit...

Today, I did the same thing again, though with slightly less profit. I’ve been focusing on just this one stock because the whole thing feels so surreal. I was literally sitting on the toilet, and with one click on my phone, I doubled my money, lmao. The next day, I almost tripled it again.

It kind of bugs me that I only put in $30, but at the same time, it feels like gambling just with better odds.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1hivpjr/trading_intuition_exist_or_am_i_just_getting_lucky/,14,2024-12-20 23:38:09,"come back in 90 days and let us know how it turned out; You are gambling. 
Lose 50% of your account and you need to make 100% to get back to breakeven. Lost 90% and you need to make 900%. Lose 100% and you are cooked. Keep that in mind.; It's luck. If you had $30,000 to invest instead of $30 would you have put it into that penny stock? What happened to you can happen for 20 straight days, and then suddenly...; Yeah, probably just luck. Penny stocks are a wild ride, and it’s easy to feel like a genius when you double your money on the toilet. 

Just don’t get too cocky, eventually the market smacks everyone; Haha you got lucky. You’ll blow your account very soon; Intuition does exist but it extremely rare and often related to a very thin and granular understanding of the market complexities. To the point where you could somewhat build a sound theory (no technical analysis nonsense) around it. 

That was the case for Soros theory on reflexivity or Livermore and his ability to “read the tape” 

But once again it is extremely rare and to validate if you have it or not, you should start formalising what you call intuition by writing down your observations and conclusions and what push you to put a trade on or not.; Ahhhh the feeling of taking credit for yourself while its being pure luck feeling so good ahhh; Give yourself 10 years and then see if it was intuition with some luck or just luck. Way to take the initiative!!!!; No luck in trading; Yeah there is trading intuition. For example, my win rate is 96% this year. The hard part is scaling up without getting over confident.; Happens to me in the beginning but once I decided to scale up, it didn't work 😫; bought a penny stock was up 400k. ceo got arrested lost it all in an afternoon. before that I thought I was the shit.; You're just getting lucky. There's no intuition in the way you're describing this situation. Brownian motion is not intuitive. You can't just ""feel"" like you know where a particle will be at some point in time. If you could, you'd have changed math and physics forever.; You got lucky. There are a few traders who specialize in trading small cap and penny stocks.; The opposite thing can happen too… it drops and you double down. Then it declines and the company files for bankruptcy. 

How do you minimize your risk while maximizing profits?; It is gambling, but that doesn’t mean you don’t have an edge. I know people who have this kind of intuition on meme stocks. Do you have any idea why you bought and sold when you did? Did you see something in the price action that made you think the stock was about to rise further?

While it is certainly possible you developed an intuition for this stock, this kind of intuition typically takes many years to develop. If you’re really only started 3 days ago, then I would attribute your gains to pure luck, and it’s best to look at it this way so that you don’t get cocky and take on more risk than you should.; What stock is it??? Also no shit I’ve never invested till I one day I woke up at 3 in the morning and instantly was obsessed with stocks when I never gave a damn about them or understood them. To me it was risky gambling but somehow I had it in my brain to look for AI stocks and bought 27 shares of nivdia at $116 and I’ve been investing a lot and doing well since. Out of all I’ve invested I haven’t lost a dime in profit. It was like my ancestors came to me in a dream. Anyway! My new penny stock is BBAI; Your intuition will never beat the market; You can absolutly have trading intuition, but you have to realize if its actually intuition or luck. Then if its intuition you have to not let your ego get in the way of your intuition, your ego can be pretty loud, its hard to know the difference. 

Then when your intuition is wrong its hard to know what voice to listen to, this is why we develop strategies, then when your strategy and your intuition line up its beautiful and hard to trade without BOTH.; Well both, You sell high, you buy low. You’re getting lucky coz essentially the market may want to go lower then the low you bought or higher when u sold at the high but ur being smart about it. Just dont let this go to ur head, dont make rash decisions and just be calm; Make a note of what you did and why, the rationale behind each trade, time of the day, how much you won or lost etc. This will help you get better. I would also say you should learn about position sizing first of all. You don't want to get wiped out and margin called on a handful of bad trades. Successful trading is about on average making money constantly over a prolonged period. In other words you still need to positive within a years worth of trading.; You can be lucky until you are not.  Yes, I have been both.  You can protect your profits by setting stops.  You might miss a sudden surge but sudden drops are ten times more likely.  If you miss a good rally you can just wait for another one.

Second of all when something has potential it means it can't get any worse than it already is.

Give him this week and you will see the next post ""intuition isnt exist - my story""; Do you think it's not worth playing with these stocks? Like I said, I only put some money into it because it's fun to watch and make some money each day. I don’t have the time to fully commit or learn trading right now. That’s why I was originally just thinking about investing and avoiding things like this.; This isn't pure luck. He started investing.Changed his strategy like a Pro towards the right penny stock, Took his profits and invested again,to Triple his money.; He didn’t take any credit for himself though. He said he’s new and he asked if he is getting lucky or not. Why is this sub so full of miserable people; No yo don’t have 96 percent rate; So you still held the stock, or did they refund the money?; You mean when it drops below my purchase price and I buy more? Nah, I usually just sell instantly when I see it drop by 1–2%. That’s nothing with a $30 budget. After that, I check the chart, look at the lowest point it hit yesterday or today, and buy within a 1–3% difference from that. So far, that’s worked for me.

As for selling at the highest point, I have no idea how I managed that it’s just luck..; no, plenty of things are already high and have potential to go higher; Dude, if you’re just in it for a quick thrill and a bit of pocket change, go for it. Just remember these random plays can bite you in the ass if the tide turns. 

That’s why people normally stick to simpler stuff—less stress, more chill. If you’re not diving deep into charts or messing with MT4 indicators on the regular, don’t sweat it; Best to just avoid it. There is no need to commit to invest. Just commit to saving and putting into an index fund and KEEP CONTRIBUTING regularly even if just a little as $30 a month. Let the FREE compounding work the magic.; Lmao try trading penny stocks next two weeks and see what happens. Your account goes to zero; Keep working on that 30$. Put it back and have fun learning with the profit. I used 50$ and racked up 0 profit but in the end had a total of 11,000$ in trades. It was fun winning but in the end its not retirement. I lost a total of 50$ learning so far. Testing youtube strategies and it just gives you a more confident eye spotting potentially profitable entries.; Because major part of people lose their money 🤣; If you can't accept people can have close to 100% win rate, you shouldn't be trading. 100% is what you should be striving for.; you're not serious are you??? Wow this gave me a fucking laugh for sure; I’m gonna screenshot, frame and put this comment on my desk.; I literally sold it for what I bought it for....pennies. They are now bankrupt and don't exist.; The fuck? Market doesn’t “refund” money dude.; It’s that easy! You’re going to be rich! Imagine all the people who have traded for years and can’t do what you do. I wonder why?; 😂! Your “strategy” is not strategy but gambling in market. Report back to this sub after a month.; 😂; Nah, dude, I don’t know anything about all this stuff. I’m just curious and not afraid to ask stupid questions. :); I see you can't take this seriously.; The CEO personally delivered him the cash and a thank you note for investing in the company; Just laughing at stupid ignorant comments; If you don't believe something that is true, who is the ignorant one? Questions like this are beyond your understanding, you don't know what's going on.; No one should be aiming for hundred percent because that is literally impossible unless you bought spy and voo and just held until you’re in the green. 

It is the profit to loss ratio that determines what win rate you need to have. Yes you should shoot for a higher win rate like 60-80 percent (which most likely it’ll be 40-70 depending on RR) knowing shooting for 100 percent isn’t possible. You sound ignorant. Please don’t give advice to people; As I said, you don't know what's going on. I'm telling you my win rate this year is 96% and you are fabricating an alternate reality where this isn't possible to affirm your own beliefs.; 😂 sure buddy have fun"
Why are my bond funds doing so poorly?,"My IRA consists of three index funds that have been doing really well, and three bond funds that have not. VTABX is down almost 12% over the last five years, VBTLX is down 14%, VWEAX is up 0.4% this year but down 9% over 5 years. I keep holding on to them thinking this is a long-term game and diversification is good. But I'm wondering if it wouldn't be better to roll this money into something more exciting like VOO or QQQ or individual big-name stocks like Apple, Amazon, Nvidia etc. These bond funds make up about 15% of my total IRA (around $8k out of $50k). Would love some honest feedback.

Edit: I'm in my early forties, have a healthy 401k ($150k), and don't mind some risk in trying to grow my IRA.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hiq5qp/why_are_my_bond_funds_doing_so_poorly/,35,2024-12-20 19:23:11,">VTABX is down almost 12% over the last five years

It is not.

You should never look at share price alone unless it is a company which has no dividend.  All that matters is total return.  That is true of equity ETF/MF but especially true of bonds which payout a signficant portion of lifetime earnings via dividends.

VTABX has a return of 0.12% on annualized basis over the last five years.  GRanted is pretty terrible.  Honestly I have no interest in foreign bonds.  Currency changes can have completely swamp any gains.

>VBTLX is down 14%

It is not. VBTLX total return is 0.04% CAGR.  Granted that is pretty bad but it shows how looking at share price along is worthless.

Now ~0% return is pretty bad but bonds went through the worst 5 years in the last 80. Typically returns are better although not particularly high.  Longterm return on total bond fund is around 2% real which with say 3% inflation would be 5% nominal.  There will years it does better but plenty of years it does worse too.; Why are bond funds doing poorly?

Bond funds typically hold bonds with varying maturities, at varying rates. When interest rates rise, bond funds typically *lose value*, because newly issued bonds will have higher interest rates than the bonds held in bond funds. With most of the world facing relatively elevated inflation, the expectation is that interest rates will remain higher than pre-2020 which means you would expect bond funds to have mediocre returns. 

Should you sell and shift to something more ""exciting?""

That depends on your investment goals and timelines. Given that this is your IRA (presumably Roth) I would aim to maximize total return to take advantage of the tax advantaged gains. If you're young (20s) I would argue that having any bonds is not optimal, but that's up to personal preference.

If you decided to hold bonds at some point, you should consider whether your initial reasoning for choosing to do so is still valid. Many people hold onto bonds not for the excitement of potential returns, but for the relative stability. If you feel like throwing caution to the wind and going all in on equities, that's perfectly fine.; Just about all bond funds are down in price from 5 years ago.  Rates were much lower 5 years ago.  As rates go up, price goes down. Long term bond funds are down the most.  the shorter the average term the less they are down.; Inflation dilutes the real yield. Lower rate bonds lose trading value.; You bought when rates were low.  Now rates are higher.  Therefore your bond funds are worth less.; If your bonds aren't doing well....that's a good thing ......  That means your stocks are doing well( better)....; I've never had bonds as part of my portfolio till just this year. I was talking with my MIL and she mentioned how she had significant losses over the past few years. That was my cue to buy a bit. Something things go on sale. I'll be DCAing into my bond funds over the next year and re evaluate then.; Maybe this is a silly question, but are you re-investing distributions, and if so, are you accounting for that in your assessment of them?   If you just look at gains in a UI in a brokerage the will not typically account for re-invested distributions.    They will never be as exciting as stocks but right now they are not terrible.  In a falling interest rate environment bonds are not bad.   When interest rates rise is when they are really bad (in the short term, over the long term it all averages out).; Need to understand the relationship of borrowing rate, fund ranking, years to maturity, demand vs supply etc.  Can not blindly own them hoping it works for you at all times.

VOO once was down -50.65 % within a few months that took 6 years to recover. As for QQQ one time it was down more than 1/3 prior year for 3 years in a row. It took 16 years to reach breakeven point.  Some of the big player like MSFT once it tanked so much took also 16 years to regroup. As for INTC it reached a peak at $75 well 23 years later it is at $19.52.

It takes more time and skills to understand bonds. I have a book on it. But each time there is another factor not considered.; I don’t invest in bonds to make money.  That’s what the stock market is for.  Bonds are “protection” for when the stock market tanks.  I can’t say I’ve done it as often as I wish, but in theory, when it tanks and I think the bottom has been had, then I’ll shift some bond money to the stock market tank and hope it helps make up for what’s been lost. Then rebalance before the bubble bursts again.; Timing-wise, bonds aren't doing so well after Fed Chair Powell signalled to the market that the fed planned fewer interest rate cuts than expected for 2025 this week. That caused yields to rise, meaning investors want more money for holding bonds, and things like bank rates on loans shot up as well. If you want to get nerdy about it, my book *Stock Market Sentiment, Structure & Game Theory: Essential Tools for Profiting from Trading and Investing*  goes over all the theory behind questions like these. My book would say that it's a good time to be in stocks, and lists \~50 ETFs from the examples in the book I cover, which are commonly used by financial advisors like Fidelity and Vanguard, and big money managers. It helps to sit down, read about the stock market once, and never feel like you have to do much because you read about it once. Over the last 5 years, investors have also suffered from higher interest rates because of inflation... which is why versus 2019, their market values would have fallen overall.; Are you considering their yield or just looking at the price? The price of bond funds won't move much over long periods of time. They should stay around par give or take % depending on their duration. Higher duration has a higher price variation but a more stable yield.

Bonds aren't for growth, they are for preservation. If you want growth, don't be in bonds.; Somethings in life you learn what not to do. Bonds and this diversify for the sake of not losing money when the market goes down just blows my mind......the oppurtunity cost far outweighs anything else.; Whatever you do, don't make SAA decisions based on trailing 5 years which is anything would tell you the inverse of what you want. ; How old are you?  Seems like you are too young to have that much allocated to bonds, but I don’t know your specific details. 

I was always taught bonds go up when stocks go down, but my 20 years of investment experience has taught me otherwise. What I’ve noticed is that bonds aren’t really an inverse of the stock market. Instead they lessen the big swings you’d see if you only held stocks. 

If you’re not near retirement, lessening the big swings isn’t really important yet. But it is important once you start nearing retirement.; Those wanting stability, hedging and reasonable returns have left intermediate and long term bonds since the firstborrow rate fall last fall (Sep 16). Right now wanting interest is CD.  Skilled investors already locked into individual bonds 15-20 years at above CD interest rate of 4.4%.; [removed]; Why? Bonds got trashed in 2022 when fed started monkeying around with interest rates to fight bidenflation. Long bonds got hit the hardest. Short bonds less bad.  You need to research your bond funds and look for the average duration. For example my long bond fund with vanguard has average duration of approx. 8 years. That means it could take 8 years to recover any lost principal. All you can do is set the dividends to reinvest, and sit back and wait and watch. They will eventually recover if you wait.  Or you can dump them now and write off the loss against your other gains.; A bond fund is not the same as a bond.i learned this years ago; Bond are safe but don't yield as much as something like an ETF. 

Couple that with the overall economic climate and inflation and you have your answer. 

Hard to tell what your portfolio should look like without understanding your goals and risk tolerance, it's likely best to chat with a financial advisor (an actual advisor and not just a talking head trying to sell some junk) and use that as input I to your strategy; Suggestion:  diversify into a managed commodity account.  The world has their money loaded in stocks and bonds.  Bad!  Invest where China has needs!  They have 5 times more people than America!  That’s where to look at!; Thanks for pointing that out. Good to know.; I agree on your points but it seems that a money market account would have done better almost across the board. The real plus for me is being able to use the capital loss against my gains elsewhere.; One of the only foreign bonds I’ll buy is Swiss. CHF is the strongest currency in the world. In fact, I’d choose a Swiss bond over US treasury most of the time; Early 40s.

But I get what you're saying.; Early forties. Probably another 20 years until retirement. I understand bonds are more about preservation.

And then reduces the interest rate when inflation drops. It doesn't water which party controles the white hose.; Morningstar has some good charting that includes interest & dividends. 

But your question is still a good one, and one I ask myself frequently. Bonds have just sucked for a long time now, including TIPS. 

I’m staying the course, but really kicking myself for not switching from bonds to cash (T-Bills, money markets, CDs, whatever) 4 years ago, and still wonder if that wouldn’t be the better move even now. 

But I’ll probably stay in bonds. *sigh*; In the short term sure.  The last 5 years have been some of the most brutal that bonds have every experienced.

Over the long run bonds have yielded about 2% real and cash (to include MMF, HYSA, short duration CDs, etc) have yielded about 0% real.

If you know the years where money market accounts will beat bonds and the reverse then you should definately keep money in cash during the years it beats bonds and then buy bonds before bonds beat cash.; Bond funds are longer duration, so they're smoothing out the swings in rate changes. When ultra short rates go higher than longer duration funds you can get a higher immediate rate, but that's also when the price of longer duration funds gets hit the hardest and therfore when you'll get more bang for your buck given some set period.

For example, if you look at a 20 year period, or whatever number, there will be times when ultra short rates are higher than a ladder based on that period, but there are times when they'll be lower and the average will be very similar to the ladder or longer duration fund because they're based on what the short term rate will be over that time. You can have a rate that varies between 1-5% over that time or you can get 3% the entire time.; Like a HYSA?; I can't predict the markets.  But one thing for sure, you will keep getting the dividend as long as nothing defaults.  And you are not down as much as a lot of long term bond funds are - some are down 30-40%.  Some folks are saying rates may continue up in the short term due to fed response to Trump Tariffs.  But in the long term, the almost have to come down because high rates are not sustainable by the US government due to deficit/debt issues.; No, give that you have an appropriate target allocation for your goals, the last couple years are when you should have been buying more bonds as the price is low because of higher short term rates and equities performing so well. You should have a plan and trust the process. Waiting for the performance of bonds to improve means it'll be too late because you've already lost value selling equities that are down and then you're paying more for bonds that are up in price.; You own bonds in the biggest bond bubble in human history. They will never match inflation if you are waiting for the yield. You can only increase your wealth in bonds by trading them or in arbitrage. High yield bonds can give you better returns for more risk. As a measure of inflation gold is compounding over 8% per year for 50 years. Bond yields are not even close.; Ok.  Are you accounting for this in your numbers?  With bond funds almost all of the growth is through distributions.; I’m in the same age group and the only bonds I have are I-bonds for my emergency fund. All of my retirement accounts are all equities. 

If you want to hold bonds, you might consider them. They aren’t traded, so they don’t ever go down in value. They have 2 different interest rates attached to them. One is a fixed rate that last the entire length of the bond, 30 years. And the other is a variable rate that is adjusted every 6 months to match the rate of inflation.; Most current fed officials have been appointed by dems. They owe their jobs and paychecks to dems.; Thanks for mentioning Morningstar. Are there any other websites that show interest& dividends? 🙏; >The last 5 years have been some of the most brutal that bonds have every experienced.

Depends on which one. Funds based on short term government bonds have done ok the last few years (SGOV, TBLL, etc). SPHY and some of the high interest bond funds have been alright too, when adjusted for total return. I-bonds have given fairly lucrative returns for a few years too.; [Gold did nothing but lose value for almost 30 years.](https://testfol.io/?s=aZwvVBAO3q6); Not only that but if you are rebalancing you are using the boring money to buy the dips. Can’t buy a dip if everything you have dips too. :); Generally speaking SGOV and the like as well as HYSA, MMF, short duration CD and short duration t-bills are considered cash not bonds.  Cash and bond behave differently.  Cash has done pretty well the last five years.  Bonds have not.; What a dumb take. You selecting a specific timeframe only proves you have a bias. Nixon took us off the gold standard in 1971. Thats when gold was unhooked to the dollar. A specific event.; Cash - actual cash - has depreciated terribly. Double digits some years depending on your inflation measure. 

Short term treasury bonds have helped stymie some of that for many folks.; So? I selected 1980, not 1971.; Cash in investing terms does not mean a wad of dollar bills in a coffee can.

>Cash in investing refers to money held in a bank account or other short-term investments with little to no market risk and a maturity of 90 days or less.

Likewise when someone says Apple has ~$120B in cash they don't mean Apple has bilions of $20 bills rolled up with rubber bands stored in a locker somewhere.  Apple holding $120B in cash means primarily they are holding t-bills.

Nobody calls a 90 day t-bill a bond.  Nobody calls a HYSA a bond.  Nobody calls a MMF a bond.  They are cash.  Yes cash has done relatively well over the last 5 years but that is atypical.  The longterm return on cash is about 0% real."

I've been hearing about how everything's about to tank and it's the worst time in history to buy every other month since like 2015.  If we can hold out for a couple more years it'll be roughly a decade's worth of everybody screeching about an impending recession.

However, I bet not as many people will freak out and remove all their money like they did during the great crash, so maybe it won't be as easy to tell. Sorry I can't predict anything for you. It just seems to me like it will crash more than it has. I think there are some hardships coming that have yet to happen. But it also seems like there are enough people in power now willing to prevent a lot of that, and that's what I was basing it on, that and listening to others who've predicted it, like Buffet seems to be acting in that direction.

Lol.  The fact that you can type this, alone, means that you simply don't operate in reality and everything you say can be totally disregarded.  Love him or hate him or somewhere in between, there's no debate - Trump has not changed *at all* in like several decades.  In fact everybody (except you, apparently) voted for him specifically because they want the same man as ""trump 1.0"".; Phase 3 LSD at that...; I appreciate that tip as well.  I just checked it out, it is pretty cool.  Thank you!; You can find a monster toy online to plug it up

You were the product; I guess that is less stressfull but if you have nothing else to do but look at stocks most of the time you can gain a few extra buckos by doing stuff like that.; More like 3%; Maybe a 30% loss for those on margin. Regardless, they belong here.; A Commander in Chief going into battle needs people who take orders and direction and not a team of undisciplined, petty, whiny and weak narcissists constantly undermining his authority.

He's assembled a team of tough guys and tough women to rebuild the country ..because that's the only way to pull it out of the shit mess it's in. Tough times require tough people.; Once the debate is lost, the loser resorts to personal insults.

Observing a person and their ways ..doesn't mean you support that person. You don't know who I voted for.; Is that what you did?; Numbers are hard for some people; It’s absolutely hilarious that you think any of this.; are you fucking serious? tell us your trades so we can work in the opposite direction. the market doesn't give a fuck about your feelings and my returns have been going nowhere but up since trump tanked the market last time; It doesn't matter who you voted for.  Your opinions are not valid because they weren't formed on this planet, and you're clearly  not observing jack shit other than exactly what you want to observe.  No one is obligated to treat your made up fantasy world with the same weight as stuff that's going on in reality, just to avoid iNsULtiNg your inane beliefs.; Yeah?; 3% =30% for people who started investing in 2023.; People ridicule what they cannot comprehend. 

Because you don't understand discipline and chain of command and think its all just ""Yes men"" then you must also think that all military soldiers, seal teams, delta force, green berets etc, etc..  ..the worlds biggest ass kickers ..are just ""yes men"" ..

Ridiculing a perspective rooted in facts is the mark of an immature mind.; Interesting.. in that you seem to be describing yourself.   
Such is your delusion.; Can’t time the market, luck is luck. Could’ve sold before an earnings pump.; Yeah, Trump and all the people he’s placing in positions of power are very disciplined lol. Y’all are so stupid it’d be hilarious if it weren’t ruining peoples lives.; Maybe watch a few less Jocko videos homeboy; Keep telling yourself that mr-Donald-Trump-is-a-changed-man lmfao; Okiwoki if you think so.

Could GOEV (Canoo Inc.) Be a Hidden Gem and at a Place When Tesla Was at $1.33 Only or When Bitcoin was but Mere Cents Only?,"Hi investing friends, could GOEV (Canoo inc., I've bought quite a significant number of shares at least significant for the budget; always with cross-referencing do your own research and trust your own instincts after the data, always doing due diligence and this is not financial advice) be a hidden gem and now at a place when Tesla was at $1.33 or when BTC was mere cents (Bitcoin even started at $0) about a decade and a half ago? It was ignored coz' no one was buying much. It's always tough to see looking forward (it's always looking back of course that one see gems that could be hidden), though I always look at who's creating what, who's the real leader and Canoo's leader seems maybe a few percentages of Elon Musk. 

The Canoo founder has a lot of patents it seems, innovative it seem similar to Elon (but not as big like Elon's pre-Tesla and SpaceX, like PayPal or Zip2) had a successful venture (Solera I think). 

But only time will tell if the pattern will repeat itself with Canoo, it has a great design, innovative, especially their MPDV (I wish that was the one they focused on but had a smaller non-van version with the same). It just needs to launch already their working models (unlike that Nikola truck which even got GM fooled) have amazing design especially the shelf mechanism of their nice looking MPDV. 

If they just did a pre-order which is a genius strategy pioneered by amazing Apple, God-willing they will break through but they also need to upgrade their battery from 200mi to 320mi for good measure. They need to launch now coz' the chinese EVs are coming with tariffs by Pres. Trump or not- it's like 'finished or not finished pass your papers.' 

God bless traders and investors.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hip93e/could_goev_canoo_inc_be_a_hidden_gem_and_at_a/,0,2024-12-20 18:43:49,"This kinda looks like a pending bankruptcy to me... and if not then 10 rounds of dilution...; No. Get out while you can.

This trash is going to 0; they just furloughed a bunch of workers around christmas, not a great look.  I think they also shut down a factory.  Super risky so maybe small size is the play here; Scam company. I have never owned any stock in them but I've been watching for a while. They've never made any actual cars. They just have other companies make 3-4 show cars and deliver them at a huge cost to themselves. They have a bunch of production equipment in Oklahoma and no one knows how to set it up. Somehow they have 170 engineering employees in California that are paid to sit on their ass and do nothing all day. But they have no cash on hand and are diluting like crazy to survive because no one is dumb enough to invest in them. Absolute trainwreck. Bankruptcy is imminent; Your bags must be heavy - as this was dead a long time ago.; So… what do they do?; That'd be sad, it's a great design the MPDV is very stylish, I'd love to have one and live in it, rent free with Starlink.; Hi, that's the thing in my extensive research and comparison, if it was a scam, it'd been exposed already like Nikola and have run off with the money like the Nikola ""EV truck"" founder (what happened to him) but they have a working model which has a unique, innovative design which was checked out by sir Sandy Munro: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3Sj2jJmug8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3Sj2jJmug8) 

I'd love to buy God willing their cool looking MPDV (a smaller version which I suggested, though that van is the coolest) which has a nice beveled edge and cool lights. It's probably what a Tesla CyberVan, if they made one (though that may well  should look like.

Also if they've given up, they wouldn't try to not get it delisted by opting for a 1-for-20 split. A lot of companies' stocks were around that much (about a dollar or less) for a very long time, around a decade or so like Tesla or NVDA.

If Canoo would only launch already, I know (strong conviction) they will do great (not Tesla big, Elon Musk in a way is an anomaly, his Musk Enterprises hedges the companies within it), God willing. 

Instincts (after comparing it to known scams and successes) tell me I should buy more, it just needs that one break- a pre-ordered launch so it can control it's inventory. If it goes bankrupt God forbids, although my shares a significant for me, I've hedged things, it's not the top in the portfolio. GOEV, Canoo Inc. could have the pattern of an Amazon or an NVDA or a Tesla, Apple as well (though some price have to be adjusted for inflation) which had low price stocks for 10-16 years (not to the heights they became but the gut feel just tells it, pray I'm not wrong :-D ✝️🙏🏼).

Thanks for reading.; You didn't address anything I said in my comment. But alright then, good luck to you. Also ironically Nikola is actually shipping a product, unlike canoo; Nikola never had a working prototype, they just filmed a video on a road that goes downward, Canoo is different but of course lots of Hail Mary's (Arrival EV which went bust which Canoo got their tooling from is different- nothing innovative but buses take more resources to make. They're MPDV is a great design. Though I understand, let's pray and hope this is like Apple  when it's stock was at 2006 and then Steve Jobs came ()who knew) :-) It's pure instincts now- it really just needs to do a pre-order.

Also their stock is practically $0 why don't they just file for bankruptcy like Arrival, which for me is they are going to make a move, I don't think their CEO is quitter."

The Current State of the Stock Market in 2024: How Should We Navigate the Ever-Changing Market Environment?,"Hello everyone, as I've been observing the stock market lately, I've noticed that the volatility has been increasing. Especially in 2024, the market seems harder to predict, and many investors seem to be taking a “wait and see” approach, as there doesn’t appear to be much certainty. Tech stocks are still performing well, but they are also facing significant pressure to adjust, while traditional industries are more stable, though they lack explosive growth potential.

Firstly, tech stocks continue to be the darlings of the market. Companies like **Apple**, **NVIDIA**, and **Tesla** have attracted a lot of capital due to their strong performance and promising outlooks. However, we must face a reality: have these companies reached their peak valuations? In the past few years, the rise in tech stocks has made many investors a lot of money, but now the market seems to be undergoing a revaluation cycle. With macroeconomic uncertainties and rising interest rates, the overall valuation pressure on the market is intensifying.

Additionally, the rise in interest rates is certainly a major issue. The Federal Reserve's rate hikes, while aimed at combating inflation, have far-reaching consequences. The increased cost of borrowing is squeezing both consumer spending and investment, which poses a threat to the earnings expectations of many companies. Recently, some once-strong consumer goods and retail stocks have reported disappointing earnings, especially those companies that rely on cheap capital, which may face even greater challenges.

That being said, I also see some opportunities. Companies with solid performance and strong cash flow, particularly dividend stocks, have become especially attractive in this environment. The uncertainty in the market has made many high-risk, high-volatility stocks more unreliable, while a more conservative investment strategy seems to be better suited. For investors looking for long-term returns, perhaps it’s time to focus less on short-term gains and more on stocks with strong risk-resilience.

Overall, the stock market in 2024 is truly filled with both challenges and opportunities. Investors need to approach it with a calmer mindset, more patience, and a solid asset allocation strategy, without blindly chasing short-term hot stocks or trends. What do you all think? How are you adjusting your investment strategies in the current market environment? Feel free to share your thoughts and experiences.

**Conclusion**: This post is just my personal perspective, and it may not be entirely accurate, but I believe everyone in the market has their own unique insights. I hope this sparks more discussion, and perhaps together we can identify some truly worthwhile investment opportunities in this volatile market!",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hild07/the_current_state_of_the_stock_market_in_2024_how/,5,2024-12-20 15:48:02,"

It is a great product, but buying expensive will decrease by a big margin your gains. 

Saying that I have them in my watch list.; It was at 280 half a year ago. No thanks.; I've been selling.  Will keep some as a long-term position but not buying here at all.

I don't disagree with anything you said but the stock was up about 75% going into the election (which, in any name is an awfully good year in/of itself) then post-election proceeded to go up about another 56% in a matter of about a month before pulling back. It's still up 150% YTD.

Primary concern that I have is that it feels like you have a handful of things that people believe are ""easy money"" because of the election. For those who were on here in late 2020, there was also a lot of discussion that the clean energy ETF was ""easy money"" because of Biden. So you had the ICLN etf go up about 55% between the election and the first week of January, pulling forward considerable growth. People thought it was easy money because of Biden, but bought the shit out of it to the degree that it created a mini bubble and the top was right before inaguration. Clean energy then ran into other issues (inflation/higher rates), but for all the ""easy money"" discussion, it really never did well from the get go during the Biden administration.

Not apples to apples obviously but I do think that with a few things viewed as beneficiaries of a Trump election, the market has indiscriminately bought to the point where it's once again pulling forward a lot before the administration even starts. I don't know that this plays out like clean energy at all looking over the coming years, but in the very short-term you've priced in a lot. A *lot lot* especially when it got towards $700. 

If AXON got back into the $300's I'd look at adding some back.; Is this dip in the room with us? I don't see it; AXON is being added to the NASDAQ 100 (QQQ) during its upcoming reconstitution. 

Moderna (MRNA), illumina (ILMN), and super micro computer (SMCI) are being removed and Axon (AXON), Micro Strategy (MSTR) and Palantir (PLTR) are being added. 

Changes will become effective prior to market open on Monday, December 23rd 2024; huma is new axon; I ended up selling my AXON recently. It became too large of a position of my net worth and I got uncomfortable with the valuation. Sadly I’m going to pay taxes up the ass. Thankfully it’s all long term cap gains.; What dip?; I'll buy at $160.; My biggest regret, not getting in ever. Saw it recommended in Motley fool a few years back, but never pulled the trigger. Ugh; What happens when next admin declares that officers have a carte Blanche do what ever you like and axon is now useless?; What would be your entry point?; SaaS is a completely different model/demand than clean energy right now; I’m late here, but care to explain? I’m pretty skeptical of biotech; Sadly?  Until they start taxing at a rate more than 99%, you are still coming out ahead.  Congrats on the gain and the ""long term"" status.  That's a win win!; With that logic I’d buy PLTR at $20. Never gonna happen; You can't buy everything Motley Fool recommends.; I got in because of the MF recommendation.  I bought like 30 shares around the $50-$60 price.  Bought like 7 more along the way up.   I just sold 2 shares at $604 to take a little profit.  I'm holding on to the final 35 for the next 5 or 10 years.; This is why people think retail is dumb; I'm not trying to be an A-hole, and you won't be able to figure out who I voted for by this comment, but are you letting your political frustration totally taint your perspective of a stock?; Nothing above 200 makes sense for this stock. The EPS is around 2$, with a maximum of $4.46 expected next year. Is a massive grow but for 2026 is expected to go to $4.65, they will need to figure out how to generate all the income to justify a valuation of 40 billions. 

  
Way to expensive, should be around 10 - 20B.; Wasn't comparing companies/business models at all, which I noted above. Was comparing similar post-election ""FOMO"" buying (the degree of which is pulling a lot of the perceived benefit forward before the administration even gets into office) based upon belief that something would be major beneficiary/""easy money"" given election results. That's all.; Nobody thought META would drop 70% in 2022. It's just math. AXON needs a 10 year compounded FCF growth rate of 33% to justify the current stock price. That sounds insane to me.; That's obvious, nor was I saying anyone should. I've been a member of the top service for years, and have bought maybe 5 recommendations total, out of about 100 they've made.; Well done.; Retail ain’t dumb, people are dumb !!!; I know. I’m just pointing out that SaaS businesses are booming right now and have been, I don’t think that’s going to stop anytime soon; Blah blah blah 🙄; I didn't mean to sound degrading, sorry if I came across that way.  I have never subscribed to Motley Fool but have considered it.  Would you recomend it?; No worries.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

""Coal demand set a record high in 2024"", at ""8,771 million metric tons this year, up 1% from 2023"". Moreover, they revised up 2023's demand from 8563 million tons to 8,687, ""The difference equals roughly the annual demand of Japan, the world’s fourth-biggest coal consumer."" The IEA is predicting demand to continue rising the next 3 years, although their estimated increase is small. The revision of estimates for 2026 in the span of 1 year has increased by the annual demand of the US and Japan combined.

[Visualize previous forecasts and the historical trend](https://i.imgur.com/uSWpbQd.png).

The world still burns 10 dump trucks of coal ever second, or a Great Pyramid of Giza every 6 hours ([source](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-07-25/climate-crisis-old-king-coal-remains-omnipotent-and-omnipresent?sref=5dj0X2VO)).

Coal will continue its decline in the US and most of Europe. But those countries need more energy period, as well as storage capacity. Though there was a recently a major power 'crisis' in Europe because of dunkelflaute, where the wind/solar output simultaneously fall. As a consequence, Germany and a few other countries were drawing substantially from their neighbors grids, causing everyone's power to go up. The electricity price in Germany literally 10xed its average on one of those day. Norway/Sweden faced similar spikes and were naturally very annoyed by this. [To put in context, the power prices increased so much that a 10 minute shower in Sweden = $5]

Averaged over 2023, you can see [UK and Germany industry](https://i.imgur.com/Yj9MLVH.jpeg) are facing much worse costs than peers around the world. It's pretty remarkable how cheap electricity in the US is if you consider it's income per capita is much higher than say Argentina or India but we have cheaper energy.

As for this ongoing winter, [Europe seems to be drawing on its natural gas storage](https://www.thecommoditycompass.com/p/european-natural-gas-and-electricity) quite quickly. This article focuses mostly on the Netherlands/Germany/UK. You can see for example, [that a period of dunkelflaute](https://i.imgur.com/XoGMk9C.jpeg) in November caused Dutch storages to drop by 20%. Europe doesn't have infinite storage, so if they draw down on storages entirely, expensive LNG imports + demand destruction have to fill the gap.; America is too joyful of a place to have a correction before Christmas.

Thoughts??; META actually down; I'd be surprised if the META movement wasn't options day related as it's one of the more popular tech names, so it likely gets lots of call option buying (the Broadcom movement probably also is and it's why I wasn't a fan of it going as crazy as it did last week and Monday).

For that matter, we're seeing exactly why I didn't want the resurrection of TSLA to occur, because if it blows up, it can shove around the indexes, both on the upside and the downside (and it blowing up might end up being an indicator of a high coming soon, but it's too early to tell).

Maybe it doesn’t occur without Powell’s speech, or is at least delayed, but it goes to show you that you can’t get as imbalanced as we did without consequences. 

I should’ve figured this, but I think we bottom Monday and then don’t have tech lead for the remaining trading days. Don’t think this is all OPEX related, but 6k breaking on the S&P is consequential on OPEX week, and it seems likely now that we’d have just stayed flat without Powell mentioning inflation.; These small cap, momentum stocks are gonna be the first to get hit hard.

especially healthcare - something that never goes away. 

alot of high dividend healthcare stocks have been killed on all fronts by 1) Trump Win 2) UNH assassination 3) health just being in general out of favor most of the year 4) end of year tax loss harvesting. 

example - PFE keep releasing better and better guidance and the stock barely responds and is basically at a 12 year low (for obvious reasons though); Kind of a fun fact, no one really does either. People that trade, will us TA, but that isn't 100%. It's mainly just an educated guess based on everyone using the same psychology.

Going to be starting my Roth and contributing the max and was going to start adding to my brokerage account, but now I'm thinking, contribute to the roth and let the money sit there, so I can catch up, starting it late, but then just keep funneling more into my HY savings account and take the 4.7%, all this red is just fucking awful.; Sounds like the actual result was 22.5% weight loss instead of an expected 25%.  Sell off does seem a bit much.; Same. IMO a complete overreaction. 22.7% vs 25% isn’t that significant of a difference in someone who’s 250 lbs (comes out to be losing 5 more pounds). 

At the end of the day, it’s still an effective drug and LLY and NVO are the only players in this market for at least 1-2 more years. 

NVO is still going to do very very well overall; It has a long way to go to get 230 back; I doubt this one will go through in US because they may be viewed as too much of risk for the US in light of the TP-Link internet routers issues.; For my own sanity I hope that you are wrong.; I like it.

Completely insane valuation. ; I bought a ton on it's first day of trading ($10.xx), watched it shoot up and then sink back down within a couple of years and bailed on all of it, thinking I'd get back in when the time looked right. Back then I remember reading an opinion that sounded correct, that this co's stock would probably languish for a few years, then explode up towards 10x. It did. I didn't. Oh well.; Lower inflation = good. Rate cut = good. Rate cuts happening slower or lesser in frequency = bad. Inflation data comes monthly. Interest rate decisions every few months. Sometimes they happen on same month. Hence we saw bad --> good in short succession.; AMD short-term technically quite a bit oversold and probably being pretty impacted by end of year loss selling.  

Beyond that, there was the trade late last year until around March where people were clearly hoping that AMD would catch up to some meaningful degree to NVDA.  That faded in the Spring when it was clear it wasn't happening and earnings reports have been.... ""fine"", ""good, but"", etc. Short-term could certainly bounce especially towards the end of month and early next year, but beyond that people are going to go, ""Why don't I just own NVDA or AVGO?"" and AMD has yet to make enough of a case to people.; next -  AMD to 95 NDA to 200.

I wouldn't but at this price...but the market itself if richly priced right now so you do you.; Id love to have been able to grab some of that premarket action, was under $10 for a sec; They've always been like too pricey for me to want to take the plunge. I do have some exposure in the space, but it's mainly through $CW and $DSR. 

CW is on the pricier side, but I bought them like a year ago. Big thing for me is that they have nuclear exposure. 

One of things I've added to my investment thesis is getting exposure to naval components, due to the fact the US is behind China in ship building. We will need to invest more. 

That's kind of why I like DRS as well.; Just dumped makes no sense at all.

3 months' worth of gains gone in 3 days.; Stock just has such strange movement day to day. Big daily swings on no news is normal for it.; Last minute witching action clearly favored aapl nvda and dingdonged meta and tsla; I believe it will drop to 550.  It doesn't mean to sell, I am bullish on it but thats just me.  It was trending down on witching day so it should pull back healthily on its next leg up.; > it was impossible for this thing to stay down

And by ""this thing"", let's just say. Ha ha.

My peanits.; Are you still puts/short/cash or did you give up?; PLTR and AVGO; Last 2 months? Almost everything is up my friend.; IonQ and RocketLabUSA have been very kind to me this year.; LUNR RBRK DAVE CFLT; A few stocks:

Sprouts Farmers Market

Rocket Lab

Cloudflare

Even Dardens Restaurant had a great earnings call yesterday and saved my portfolio from going red lol.; Are there really any Discounts atm?; When has anyone said Uber is next Waymo lmao.

I thought it was Google is the better company. Uber is one going out of business with Waymo expansion soon.; You got your wish!; Most people here didn’t buy in 2024; That move matches your name perfectly. 20k risk for a 2% gain; I have a friend that trades like this with a cash account, rarely takes losses but never makes enough to stop complaining about not making decent gains. So in an attempt to increase his gains he just opened an options account. It totally blows my mind with the risk vs reward logic to consider options trading if you’re only shooting for 2-3% in a cash account…. either way good luck with this meta play I’m sure you could find a 2% in intraday,  just watch out the chart had dead cat bounces on Thursday and Friday.; What do you mean? Ionq up past week and year close to 500%, people making bank. I doubt the retail investors are sad about that ; I bought Amazon ATH in August of 2022 at 134. I'm now up 5k on the stock. Time in the market is better than timing the market. You'll be fine; I put 15K in 2022 Jan 3rd. It happens lol; not an app but totalrealreturns.com might be helpful to you; Will be interesting to see. A big part of NKE's story was the previous CEO and the move to direct to consumer during the pandemic. 

Like during that time period, they moved away from innovation. I can only go off my own experience, but I did recently buy some ON shoes over Nike since none them where that nice. I would be happy to buy Nike again if they made better shoes. 

I think the other aspect is the new CEO worked up to the position from being in the company. Which I think is a good thing. 

However, I'm not the biggest fan of investing in retail companies. Also not a fan of investing in turn around stories. 

It does seem like the sports market is huge and only getting bigger. Like the most watched live events were NFL games.; All the arguments for why NKE will bounce back seem to be based on their brand and hope. The power of that brand has weakened over time. I just don’t see enough to want to invest in it, but a number of people feel differently. We’ll find out who’s right 📈📉; I feel like the heyday of NKE's marketing is over. They struck gold with Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, and ""Just Do It"". GenZ doesn't view them in the same light.; [removed]; [removed]; [removed]; To each their own. 

I think speculating is fine as long as it’s done responsibly. There is money to made. 

I’m personally long RKLB. Would never suggest buying at these levels, but I’m up over 500% on my investment because of that speculation. 

I tend to buy stuff based off fundamentals, but have been a big fan of the company. Been posting about them being my lotto ticket for years here. 

I think it’s better to help each other try to make money. ; Rklb still up 10-15% on the month. If people bought the top of these stocks and hadn't been DCAing in its part of the risk.; I can't help but laugh at all the people here who always speak as though they have a firm grip on the market and their strategy is the way to go. We're all speculating. Some better than others so to get on your podium and ho-hum other people is petty and stupid.; You’re 100% right but prepare to be downvoted since it seems like more posters here are meme bagholders than ever before.; ""Nothing sedates rationality like large doses of effortless money. After a heady experience of that kind, normally sensible people drift into behavior akin to that of Cinderella at the ball. They know that overstaying the festivities — that is, continuing to speculate in companies that have gigantic valuations relative to the cash they are likely to generate in the future — will eventually bring on pumpkins and mice. But they nevertheless hate to miss a single minute of what is one helluva party. Therefore, the giddy participants all plan to leave just seconds before midnight. There’s a problem, though: They are dancing in a room in which the clocks have no hands.""

\- Warren Buffett; Yes, RKLB, a company that literally sends rockets into space is a ""shitco"" compared to the equities that you own: *checks notes* A company that sells weed.

This dude's brilliance is off the charts, everyone!; We are here to make money, memestocks, undervalued stocks, overvalued stocks, bankrupt stocks, it just doesn't matter.  Rklb, for me, is still at 300% gains. Thats all what matters.; I'm a long term RKLB holder. 

I think we will benefit from DOGE's suggestions to privatize space contracts more. 

Jeff Bezos wouldn't build a rocket company if there wasn't profit to be made. 

Give it some time, by 2030 I think we will see a share price of $75.; it's still going up lmao. jealous much? Why do you care so much about  what other people decide to do with their money?; Is one week before christmas ”early”?; I thought max pain was 370; no!; I fail to see how a weighted average of 500 stocks can have support and resistance levels if the 500 underlying stocks also have ther own support and resistance levels.; The only way to stabilize is buy back program; I'm not selling. And I know in the long term the shift will insignificant. But in the short term to see it; Could it have? I doubt it. This market will never actually go down.; Agree huge disruption gonna come to autos. If you aren't autonomous you're done. Google gonna be just fine.; [deleted]; Sure, then add on winter heating costs, kitchen/ laundry appliances, then suddenly having an electricity bill 5-10 times higher than the usual adds up. It's not literally just $5 (or rather $15 for 3 people) more per day per family! 
And that shower figure is like 20-50 cents using normal electricity prices.

Voters will riot over eggs going from $2 to $5, as we've seen recently.; Oopsie; Yea why couldn't he just keep his trap shut; Yeah… I was gonna close it out on Wednesday and take a loss. Then decided to hold and was just going to close it out regardless today. Dumb luck that I waited long enough for this huge increase. Position was at $9.42 so I didn’t make huge profit. Just don’t want to be on this ride anymore haha; Pre market it dropped to $74.17; I've done well with LPLA. Still planning on holding them.; I imagine this dude wakes up every day, checks his puts, paces back and forth in his 1 bedroom apartment, and smashes his pre-paid Boost mobile phone against the wall after typing these comments.; There is one. It's called VVIX

https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/whats-vvix-and-why-does-it-matter; Hey man this sub was rejoicing for trump lol; What makes the most sense is for cryptocurrencies to be outlawed.

Why are bearer bonds illegal but bitcoin isn't?; yea I have a pet rock, and it's worth $10,000,000 gonna call it Scamrock and paint it green.

Wanna buy it?; That’s how see it. I was able to scoop some up at 84. Figured once the actual market opens and volumes locks up, hoping people buy. 

Worst case, I caught a falling knife and I’m holding the shares longer than I’d like. ; The other issue becomes adverse effects. 22.5% vs 25% expected leads to a selloff, but if it has worse AE than something that's say 18-20%, the 18-20% that's much more tolerable is ultimately more compelling imo. 

Why did only 57% of patients get to the highest dose vs 70% with semaglutide? I think this NVO selloff is overdone, but imo it does look like VKTX - which has had a difficult year ended by a bad month w/smaller biotechs selling off - has the better drug.; Yes it does; I don’t understand what you mean? And I don’t think you know what you mean. 

This has already gone through, and it’s just them buying some patent designs of chillers they like.; I doubt it.  We're going into the cyclically weak time of year for tech.  If you can get 620 from it before February I'd consider selling but if you're long term, hey, just hang on.; They’ve already started moving away from China manufacturing.; Where is this report? I bought at the peak and am down bad; That’s what I’m thinking. The immediate future is so up in the air right now. I think I’m going to DCA monthly next year.; I do DCA for peace of mind lol but I'm on a budget and wouldn't make sense for me to unload all 7k; Didn't work well for EVVTY...; I held PLTR, have always hated Musk and told my self I would never buy TSLA. But there’s infinite potential for govt contracts over the next 4 years, they practically have the world’s largest money printer at their disposal.; you mean \*when you understand the stock market is vehicle institutions used to pump up stocks to make money regardless of the fundementals; Long term its almost impossible to keep this valuation. It trades at 500x operating income, which is just bonkers. But still, this madness can continue indefinitely.; yep , they have a continuing resolution ready for the worse case scenario, means they want to celebrate xmas with their families.; They presented their product to us with a use case that was essentially a chat GPT wrapper. I’m not sure what their value proposition was that couldn’t be replicated in house or by something much cheaper.; I tried to give explanation in the comment. Instead of repeating the same bear cases that gets mentioned about valuation. Institutions control the stock. They dont care about valuation. One part probably wants to be able to say to clients look I was in PLTR the stock that went up 350% YTD.

Maybe it me but do you ever get bored saying insane valuation day after day?; I have concluded that the Powers-That-Be know something about Palantir that we don't.

Or it's valuation is just nuts.; Thanks; how do you buy into American companies when the government takes 65% in taxes?; Lower wages though to be fair and higher taxation.; Lmao; In theory, you should be. On fidelity, you just need to turn on it. Trading pre-market or post market isn't anything that retail can't do. Just most brokers have it off by default, since volume is low and ask/bid spreads can be really wide.; Thanks! I never invested in DRS, but I have been in CW for a bit. I'll take a look :)

I've noticed that some other names like FTAI, LOAR, and WWD have all taken a 10-20% dip in the last few weeks. Going to add them to my watchlist.

I bought a HEI call to see what happens.; 
It’s down 10% in a week on nothing.  What’s crazy is we’re now in an investing world where a bad lunch at a tacky Florida golf club can affect a stock more than any amount of fundamentals.

Meanwhile oddball coins and anything with the word quant-m on their website is up by multiples.; It's a company people hate.

Personally, I loathe Zuckerberg and META.; are you even old enough to have a brokerage account?; No one could possibly make money shorting this thing unless you perfectly time the 2-3 hours where it's allowed to go down. Especially puts. The thing is guaranteed to lose at least 30-40% of its value the next day since no down move can sustain.; ionq, lunr, etc.; Depend if u got Nike, mu or smci..; I wanted to write Google, but that'd be very preposterous, to make Google all about Waymo.; 20K risk for $400 lmao

Don’t know how people do it; Had you buy in december you would be 8k on the stock. Timing the market helps the time in the market; That works as well. Thank you !; Maybe? 

Could easily just sign with Jake Paul or like MrBeast and I'm sure GenZ will eat it right up. They are still consumers.; I just like to laugh at regards speculating and then losing money. RKLB has solid fundamentals but the fair value is closer to 10 than 25 lol; Losing money on shitcos and crypto is deserved. Therefore I laugh; That makes it even funnier to me. P/Es are useless until they’re not lol; I don’t care what industry the company is in, be it space or weed. For instance, the company that sells weed has a higher revenue than RKLB whilst being valued at 5% and being profitable. 

Nobody cares about the industry, but about the cashflow that the security underneath it generates. So yes, one share in the weed retailer entitles me to 20x the free cash flow of 1 RKLB share. I’m so stupid right; Well how do you justify 35 P/S without profitability and risks still looming? I shouldn’t have used Shitco but overvalued. SpaceX is valued at 20 P/S whilst being profitable, having better technology and also having functional Starlink. One neutron going kaboom on the first flights and the price is in the gutter. You can’t rationally justify this high of a valuation without speculation; Yes, the “Santa rally” refers to specific trading days and it begins on the 24th.; You got me. I didn't actually determine what max pain was at, I just figured it might be at 420 because funny number; 503 stocks yo..; I just think it's one of those like the iPhone. I'm a bit older than most probably here, like mid 30s, and it does feel like something out of the future. 

Really feels like society still hasn't realized we have self driving cars.; Maybe? 

I made this comment around Waymo like 6 months ago. 

They’ve beeb in operation in Phoenix and SF for like years. Seems like the market is only know catching up to it. 

The 30% off the high is from like an October I believe. So the market didn’t price anything from waymo until the last few months. To me, that would make Waymo underrated, since the news of them moving into one Market, Miami, was enough to take the stock down 30%.; Trying to claim average living standards of Norway are worse than here is a lost cause but go right ahead; First dead cat bounce ?; Yep,

Bit of a pullback in financials the last week, buying more here.  Citi is undervalued right now more than most, IMO.  

Very bullish on banks, visa, MC, AMEX etc.  Profit will go into tech in late February/ early march but hey, market conditions will dictate that not time frames where things change easily.  

I remain bullish in the cycles that are happening.; That's a vivid image, thank you.; Thanks. Learnt smth today 🥳 so, we are in a transition stage, seems like. From rough waters to a calm ocean. 


That's why my options basically are flat even when underlying moved 3-4%. Normally, they'd jump at least 20-30% (they're far out).; Sounds like CDOs, is BTC the new CDO? Do you take cards? I’ll take 500 on 20 to 1 margin; Good Luck, when I look at them I just felt like their pipeline was not as strong as other players.  I would expect some small recovery.; I do wonder at the end of the day, will the consumer actually care who has the best drug? 

If ballpark is roughly the same, I’d imagine the consumer will care most about price and availability of the drug. 

Plus those who work with insurance. I’d imagine in the near future, insurance companies will want to cover these drugs, due to the fact that obesity is terrible for long term health. 

If treated like preventative care, it will actually save insurance/ consumers money in the long run. Heart disease is still the number one killer in the US. ; Oh I am long term lol.

Bought one lot in 2016, a smaller lot in 2018.

Capital gains would be murder.; Look up Grizzly Research. 11/21/2024; now I dunno lol. this market; [deleted]; at least they handled it somewhat better than AMR, who bought back to the sky whilst management cashed out stock options last january. Half the price now, no cash for buybacks left..

EVO sort of timed the market, probably not expecting further price derioration after last fairly good earnings. In hindsight, they should not deplete buyback authorization completely although the occured value loss is minimal still. US and regulated market margins is where risk is for EVO.; The problem is musk has never demonstrated he's willing to do anything politically for tesla. He's not defending the ev rebates, he's not going after the oil companies. It seems the maga got to him, not the other way around. And that's bad for tesla.; Trump does not control Congress, and based on the budget debacle currently going, not all R's will fall in line with Trump, so Trump will have a hard time passing his agenda. There's only so much corruption the executive branch can do for Tesla.; Correct, psychological, not fundamental; I can’t even conceive of the kind of person that is buying Palantir at these levels.; They can not shut the government down 5 days before Christmas.; Never used their software, but seems like all these companies are basically the same thing. More or less they have their own ETL's that move data into a data warehouse. From there, I'm assuming that PLTR must have their own models. 

I do think a lot of this can be accomplished in house, however, the ETL aspect is a pain. Depending on how much data and the type of db structure you have, trying to migrate data can be really annoying.; I think it’s a Elon Musk effect being applied to Peter Thiel. Some assumption that the election result will help his businesses in some unspecified way.

That and a rabid cult of people that invest in the stock.; European taxes are much higher; Its more the issue that my ass cant get up that early on the west coast >.<; People hate Meta

They use it, and they hate it.

They go onto Meta's apps and scream about how much they hate it 

They bitch and complain about Meta stealing their data in Europe and then use VPNs in Europe so they can use their new smart glasses pretending that they live anywhere else.

If Apple were to buy Meta, they would praise Apple for their invention of social media 

Everybody hates VR until Apple makes a headset and then charges what you could get for a kindey on the black market for it, and it flops, but now VR is dead.

Sick of this shit.; That's ok

I yearn for the days someone makes a slightly better god damn smartphone than that that rotten fruit company that can do no wrong and people remember that they hate electric vehicles.; Why?

3.06 billion monthly users.

That is just under 40% of the world's population.

Everybody hates Meta?

Oh, they will be punished if they can't get that number to 3.07%

It's the oh FB is dead people, when all they consider is the United States.

It's the oh, I hate Congress, but my congressman is doing a bang-up job mentality. 

It's complaining about Meta WHILE on Meta.

It's users in Europe bitching about their privacy while simultaneously using a VPN so that they can use Meta AI on glasses Meta told them wouldn't work in their utopian countries.

An then bitch when Meta closes the loophole and users complain and again Bitch about Meta, while all Meta is trying to do is avoid getting shaken down by those frikin Europeans.

There is only so many ways to ""social media"" and Meta has the market cornered and people can't stand being dependent on Mark Zuckerberg.

It's an irrational dislike, and I just can't figure out why.

People criticize Meta for just copying everyone else when a big chunk of Apple's revenue is taking 30% from app developers for exactly no work. 

Apple is a parasite and holds some sort of cult like following while Zuckerberg is demonized. 

He should have changed his companies name to peach or lime, and then maybe people wouldn't hate him.; >To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development.

People in their 30s can reference dick joke memes, man.; I agree I don't short indices. Are you sitting on cash? You seem a bit annoyed by the permanently rising indices a bull wouldn't mind it.; Stop losses; Don’t tell that to the regards here; There are a LOT of shitcos but RKLB isn’t one of them.; You should see all the recent Seeking Alpha articles pumping these stocks. Totally absurd.; So right!; The price is high yes but I don't believe its unreasonable.

I wouldn't buy more currently unless it hit under $20.

SpaceX is around 350 billion

RKLB is at 11.7 billion, putting it at less than 4% of SpaceX's marketcap.

That being said, it has a -70 P/E Ratio. 

This is a slow moving industry with huge potential and I'm in it for the long term. RKLB is one of my more speculative investments.; Shit I always thought it was up to christmas.; Same difference; Not enough people live in areas w robotaxis. One ride in that and people would open their eyes.; I agree in principle with safety etc but these elephant in the room is the cost, with the state of the art uber reliable chips and other components that are needed to facilitate these cars, doesn’t it put these cars out of budget for most Americans and certainly most ppl outside of America? 

You have to have some advertisement pitch that says how it will save you money over the years to convince you to buy. Safety is not enough. 
You aren’t saving any time either buying autonomous vehicles, even if you were, it wouldn’t financially make sense to buy a costlier vehicle to me.

I am taking abt relative profits from these cars to Google in relation to the money they already make since you mentioned you like GOOG for waymo.; Two things, and then I have nothing else to add:

1. Never said living standards are worse in Norway. I'm literally just saying energy costs in Europe are frequently spiking to abnormal levels in winters, to levels higher than most places in the world, including other relatively rich countries. This has bad implications for future industrial growth and economic growth. That's all. This isn't a 'US versus Norway' argument.
2. I didn't even say Norway anywhere in my comments above (the anecdote was Sweden). The hourly wage in Sweden is about 36% lower than it is in Norway [(source)](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/average-wages-across-europe-map/). And these power spikes are everywhere, Germany, Sweden, France, UK, Spain. Not just the richest Nordic country you can find.; Barrons streetwise last podcast had one of their analyst do like their 10 picks for the year. Citi was one of them. 

I don't really do banks, but I have a family member that whole sales annuities and that's how I even know about LPLA, just being the biggest independent broker service. 

Overall, been really happy owning them. Plus they aren't the worst in terms of valuation.; Ty!

This is a trade and hopefully not an investment, ie I caught the falling knife lol. ; Yes, price and availability are primary considerations, but I'll still say adverse effects (especially along the lines of PFE's failure with their trial a year ago that they chose not to advance to phase 3 - discontinuation rates above 50% does not help) vs peer offerings absolutely is a very meaningful part of the equation.

There's been this view that ""why doesn't everyone just pop out a GLP-1 drug?""  for the last two years as this theme has gone on and yet, LLY still remains with a substantial lead. NVO's stock is going to open about 40-45ish% off the high, the PFE trial results were poor, AMGN's offering doesn't seem encouraging, maybe ZEAL has something but that's -16%. IMHO the specifics matter and it's not just ""who has the biggest % loss."" 

One key cloud over VKTX is production, but when you have a top drug in the class with excellent tolerability that can at least potentially be worked out. If it was just ""who can knock a lot of a drug out and maybe the side effects are like that vomit scene from Family Guy but people lose a good deal of weight and it's cheaper"" then the market would currently have more options at this point and yet it's still almost entirely LLY/NVO two+ years into this theme and the latter is starting to look like it's falling behind a little.

I mean, I had dozens of arguments last year with people who kept trying to make the case for PFE over LLY/NVO because ""they're cheap and they have an obesity drug, too!""

Edit: Citi: ""This is nearly a best case scenario for LLY..."" (https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GfPopmZXMAAUMe2?format=png&name=900x900)

Citi also noting what I said: ""...as discussed in our note, **tolerability is paramount to doctors and patients.**""; Oh never heard of them. Solid report though; Buying European equals losing wealth straight up; Oh, I agree EVO is doing well buying at these prices. Long term, if they keep it up they can really slash their share count on the cheap. 

So far it hasn't helped though.; Lol, why not?; I’m not sure layering on a proprietary software into the process really makes things all that simpler. It certainly makes things much more inflexible. ; THought I had read that the average was something like 65%. That was awhile ago.

All that free stuff they get, sure does cost someone a lot.; You can do GTC limit orders and leave them open for extended hours. So you dont have to be on the app/brokerage for the order to execute.; Hahah totally. I'm also west coast, but I'm naturally up like 5AM every day. Kind of cool, kind of sucks lol. 

There's like one other time that I've done something like that, which was like a few quarters ago when DDOG dropped off an ok report in the pre-market. I did it this morning with NVO, hoping I didn't catch a failing knife.; I hate meta and don’t use it.  I invest since it’s slightly less toxic than tobacco.  As for VR, meta’s cheap and well liked product is one of the reasons I’ve been long.  However I wanted to crystallize the recent gains and be out of the blast radius when the corrupt TikTok thing happens, assuming I’d buy it back after that.

Now I’m probably stuck and when the TikTok bribery thing does happen, the stock will get hit again.; I had sell orders on all social media like META and SNAP and others at the start of the week since I’m sure the crime family boss will do a corrupt deal with TikTok.  I’m bitter the META ones just missed executing.  Maybe someone knows something and they front ran it here.; MSNBC keeps claiming no one uses Facebook or that weird ignoble site any longer so I understand why some people think that. ; Zuckerberg is a psychopath who has intentionally amplified the worst trends of modern society so that he can profit. 

That is why people hate him and his companies, and it is anything but irrational.; Shouldn’t have used shitco but overvalued to the tits. 30+ P/S is a joke; They have to learn somehow. Ionq to 100 right?; The comparison to SpaceX is irrelevant, SpaceX is miles ahead and you should value company by the financials and cashflow that they’re producing. You’ve got a company that’s more expensive than SpaceX (75% premium to SpaceX actually) that is inferior with all the technology and that is unprofitable. One flop and the death spiral can commence, with SpaceX it’s far less likely; this is the pre santa rally; I'm looking at these vehicles as more of a pure robotaxi vs something a consumer would want to purchase. 

No idea if it will be something that the consumer even wants 100%. There will always be people who prefer driving. Just like there is still markets for VHS and even records, before they become popular.; Banks are ok in an easing cycle and with Trumps easing of banking rules.  It's a no brainer for now but I would NEVER long banks in the USA.  They underperform.  

This is a good once in five year run up and its going to be a nice ride.  Unless we get a recession of course.  

This is how to trade bank stocks and cyclically this is the way to play it.; Because as laughable as our government has become from geriatric presidents, sex offender attorney generals, and word salad interviews a government shit down right before the biggest holiday of the year would be the most rancid diseased cherry on top ever.; Cause I said so!

It's very scientific.; Just depends.

ETL's aren't crazy, but we had to build our own due to cost. The way we structure our data, it wasn't scalable to use a different solution, due to cost. However, the trade off is that we can't migrate all the data and it there is still engineering cost in order to maintain.

I just feel like at the end of the day, when building and maintain software, it's all about trade offs. Different companies require different solutions.; Depends what do you prefer?

A social net if you get dropped or wealth if you excel beyond your peers ?; Yeow. Man I'm glad I got out of NVO back in Aug/Sept. A good company though, probably still a good long term hold, -for the patient investor. 

I think I basically swapped it then for more RKLB, just about the opposite kind of bet. It worked.; I don't know what to do with it. 

Bought my shares back in 2016 and 2018, have been more interested in maybe selling some and diversifying but not now.

I believe in the company still, this to shall pass, but all i can see are the capital gains I am gonna have to.pay when I sell.; Almost 170 million Instagram users in the United States to go along with the over 3 billion users worldwide of Meta's apps,  having a hard time seeing the hate from everyone.

You sound like the people in Australia who wanted to make it illegal for anyone younger than 16 to have an account so that they wouldn't have to parent. 

It's a lot easier to say you can't because it's ""ilegal"" than to just say no.

An yea, it is irrational.

If Meta knowing your pizza topping preference can allow you to be manipulated, that's just sad.

I'm sure the downfall of modern society has nothing to do with the Jersey Shore and the Modern Housewives of who gives a shit and everything to do with Facebook.; I don't disagree that SpaceX is miles ahead of RKLB.

RKLB had a faster time from rocket schematics to flight testing than SpaceX. 

They're progressing at a faster pace than SpaceX and I think we will continue to see that.

In November 2024 they launched electron successfully twice to deliver a payload in less than 21 hours. They have a total of 60 launches so far with a lot more in contract on the way. 

Neutron is expected to progress quicker than Electron did.

A flop would surely decimate the stock short term but they have ample funding for a dozen mistakes.; Makes sense. Kind of almost reminds of me like airlines. Seems more like a trading instrument than anything you would want to be long on.; > government shit down

Perfect; The thing is...orange man don't give an F...about any of that. You thought geriatric presidents were bad...watch the chaos this madman causes.

Please cease the political shit."
Why I’m Short Apple (AAPL) March 225 Puts – The Bubble is About to Burst,"TL;DR: Apple (AAPL) has surged irrationally, rising over $25 in December without any clear catalyst. Meanwhile, the cracks in the armor are forming—AI isn’t saving them, potential trade issues will pressure margins, and their premium valuation is unsustainable heading into Q1 2025. I’m betting the downside is unavoidable.

1. The AI Supercycle is a Mirage
Despite market hype, Apple has no meaningful AI differentiation. Unlike NVIDIA or Microsoft, Apple isn’t seen as a dominant AI player—its products rely heavily on services and premium hardware that have limited ties to AI advancement. This means no “AI tailwinds” to buoy the stock. While Apple has released some iterative software updates tied to AI (think Siri enhancements or computational photography), they’re nowhere near monetizing this tech the way other companies have. Investors are waking up to this reality.

2. Trade Headwinds and Shrinking Margins
Apple’s dependency on international manufacturing is a double-edged sword. Potential trade barriers or geopolitical uncertainties could result in increased costs, impacting its gross margins. While Apple is exploring options to diversify its manufacturing footprint (e.g., India or Vietnam), these shifts aren’t immediate solutions and are notoriously expensive. This margin compression story isn’t reflected in its current valuation.

3. Q1 2025 Will Disappoint
The first quarter is traditionally one of Apple’s strongest due to holiday sales, but cracks are forming:
	•	Demand issues in China: Geopolitical tensions and economic headwinds mean weaker Chinese demand.
	•	Premium Pricing Fatigue: Consumers are scaling back on non-essential upgrades. The iPhone 15 isn’t converting older iPhone users as fast, and other product lines (MacBooks, iPads) are not seeing the kind of innovation needed to boost sales.
	•	Services Saturation: Apple’s growth engine, services (App Store, iCloud), is nearing peak user growth, and regulatory scrutiny could start pinching service margins.

4. Valuation Has Gone Too Far
Apple is trading at 30x earnings, far above historical averages, for what is fundamentally a hardware company with diminishing innovation. By comparison, during its 2016 stagnation phase, Apple traded near 12-15x. A “soft landing” for tech multiples will hit Apple harder because its growth story is exaggerated compared to actual fundamentals.

5. The December Surge Is Speculative Froth
Apple’s meteoric $25 rise in December is unfounded. There hasn’t been a game-changing product announcement, a blowout earnings release, or AI breakthrough to justify the move. The rally is more likely driven by institutions trying to mark up their portfolios for year-end performance. When the rebalancing happens in January, Apple will be the first to feel the heat.

Why Short March 225 Puts?
AAPL closed near $250 recently. My short strike at $225 gives some cushion for temporary noise, while still capturing a high premium as investors scramble to secure overvalued positions. I’m betting that as Q1 progresses, analysts will cut estimates, trade challenges will hit margins, and reality will set in. I see AAPL revisiting the $200-$210 range in early 2025.

This is not financial advice, but it is a warning: Apple’s future isn’t as bright as Wall Street thinks. Evaluate your risk, but don’t ignore this tech bubble.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1high4l/why_im_short_apple_aapl_march_225_puts_the_bubble/,80,2024-12-20 10:51:18,"

kindly reminder.; Good luck, Apple literally has so much FCF they do $90 billion in buy backs every year.

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640); Aren’t there 1000s of other unprofitable companies to short? Why apple out of all of them?; you are right but you will lose money ![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787); Oh boy wait until you hear about Tesla.; I agree with you short term however betting against Apple long term is risky.. Apple is the master of not being first to a new technology but somehow managing to still steal the show in the end. I wouldn't be surprised if they find a way to do this with AI too.; Never bet against Apple. You’re betting against monthly automated inflows from all kinds of ETFs, pension funds, 401Ks, mutual funds. So many other junk to go short on and you pick the darling of wall street that’s been infallible for decades.; Wrecked; Good write up, but post your positions; I thrust Tim Apple to keep the stonk bullish. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883); I hold their stock forever and buy calls after a dip. This is one of those stocks that likes to go up.; Loss porn please. ; short... puts?

methinks OP is somewhat not understanding; It's apple. Goodluck. I'm up 100% in 4 years. It's fort Knox; You assume that Apple will lose customer base because they can't compete in the form of AI? Last I checked, people bought Apple products for reliability. It was never about being first or being the most innovative. It's the same argument over and over for decades now. Even if their stock price comes down a bit, their cashflow remains strong as ever with marginal increases.; Anyone else ready for GUH 2.0?; I've been saying this for a while now. Clear reasons to upgrade in the past used to be performance and battery life for both phones and laptops. Now that both are more then fine people opt to rather replace the battery then buy a new device. You see this happening everywhere. The tech simply isn't that revolutionary anymore. They try and upsell you fancy new AI stuff and fancy cameras now but AI can be accessed through a browser just fine and if you're not a photographer, you don't need such a fancy camera. 

Mark my words, all phone and soon laptop companies will start to take a massive hit. Qualcomm and their fancy new snapdragon cpu made sure of that.when will it start? Well, my guess is somewhere around March the real bleed will start. Why? God damn global unrest and how much more expensive shit is going to get.

Edit: and don't give me any of that 'but apple is an ecosystem' bs. It will be an easy choice if you have to decide between food and a phone where you just use it to watch YouTube and browse reddit on.; Betting against $AAPL, huh ballsy, stupid but ballsy; Get a load of this guy. He's *shorting Apple*; higher risk, higher prize. well.... another one bites the dust; Have fun with that. Wendy’s needs Christmas help.; Yo if buffet is cutting his stake, then he might know something. The top is in.; this will lose you money!; None of the AI stuff, while very impressive, will generate revenue. All these chips in datacenters are consuming energy. 

You need products to sell. The feature phone craziness is long gone. That in my opinion means Apple cannot maintain its product pricing. 

It has invested a lot in its chips. They are impressive. But the margins are not maintainable. 

If and when the stock market reacts accordingly is another story. But I agree Apple is due for a massive downturn.; I hope you're right and you profit but what keeps me from doing the same is people are fanatical over their products, innovation or not. People in poor countries will still buy their devices even in rough times.; You forgot to add people are getting tired of buying the same phone every year; welp, AAPL calls indeed; The catalyst was them announcing a dividend; Apple is clearly overvalued but AI hype keeps the train going.; Good write up, Apple can be a hard short (shareholders are stingy).  
But i think this will hit.; This play is a no. Apple’s customer base buys new products even with small incremental improvements and will spend thousands of dollars for it.; Will china cool on apple? That's what i worry about.; I’ve been reading “the bubbles about to burst” for the past year; Why is everything a bubble ? Why can’t it be a pullback here is an apple chart as a reminder this is the years when apple pops people the bubble is here blah blah blah. A guy that works Wendy’s is calling the bubble

Apple colab with airports for find your phone was pretty cool. Their phones are hitting a wall though progress has slowed significantly.

I wonder if they'll ever release an iPhone Fold.; Post your positions or ban; Two hundred billion in share buybacks; Apple puts are my hedge against other disaster as well. If it drops to trading near 12-15x earnings again in the next 6-9 months I'd make $2-3M lmfao.; Almost every school nationwide is locked in on buying iPads or MacBooks - makes you wonder who's making money on from it all. Of course, if the DoEd goes bye bye, that could all change...; AI on iPhone is big nothing burger; Bro, Apple is the Magnus Carlsen of companies. He will turn any situation with even the slightest advantage to a win and scoop up the full point.; Yes getting bad, as they sell 255 million IPhones for 1,500$ each; Bears 🐻 I know you guys had your one day of fun last week with that big dip, but I think it might have made you a little delulu basing on this post; Blue horseshoe loves AAPL; Goodluck.; 1% profit for 3 months?
Short put is a neutral / bullish position.
You sure it’s smart?; “Short puts”? Uk being short on a put is bullish right?; Shorting Apple requires ball of dark matter when there is so much overvalued stuff on the market.; I see big money rebalancing into Apple in January; You surely made a fortune on this; Homie there's a graveyard filled with AAPL bears who thought Apple's days were done after Steve Job's death. The moment Zoomers think iPhone are ghetto and stop buying them is the day i dump all my shares.; do not bet against the king himself; Apple is definitely way overpriced.; $AAPL PE ratio is at a peak, a level not seen since early 2021.

Warren Buffett unloaded 2/3 of his Apple stock this year. Now he is sitting on an all-time-high level of cash.

The Wednesday crash did not hit $AAPL nearly as hard as the other big tech stocks. More room to go down than other stocks IMO.; [deleted]; Idk man.. Apple announced back in June the integration of Chat GPT and have now implemented Chat GPT on their Iphones 2 days ago + MAC OS.. So not sure why you think there has not been any catalyst for their increase in stock price. Seems pretty obvious with just one google search.; Justify your position all you want, just realize it is completely wrong and you will lose
Money.  The holidays are the best time of year for Apple.  Just because the iPhone 16 didn’t sell well out the gate….probably means that people are getting it for themselves or someone else for the holidays.  Apple will print money hand over fist again this holiday….and the next year….and the next….; Only an idiot shorts apple lol every dip gets bought. Pick another stock; I'm constantly thinking about this: Shouldn't apple develop a server, which will be crazy efficient thanks to Apple Silicon, to replace some Linux servers. It's all Unix, so most things exist for Mac as well. That would open a new world to them.; Can I get the too long/can’t read on this? ⬆️; Fcf?; Buying back shares at the top isn't a great use of cash; Short the strongest. Buy the weakest.; https://preview.redd.it/j9v9cfjqpz7e1.jpeg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e902d96d19e1beb20574e2be6608645f4317e8c7; 😷☠️; **update**: shorting TSLA here wouldve made a killing; That's right. What I'd like to point out is apple just bounced off of it's high again today... that type of thing doesn't happen over and over again.

You're hearing it here first, bloody monday. If I'm wrong you can take trunks flicking my balls.

Also dow happened to go up more today than the nasdaq, first time that's happened in ages.; Imagine his surprise when he goes short on some put options, Apple skyrockets, and he goes to the eye doctor to find out why red shows up as green in his eyeballs.; The last part is so true. 
The new devices are so expensive but the only things you really need are:
- Mail
- YouTube, Netflix, whatever you stream 
- A fast Webbrowser to access most social media 
- Some games to kill time
- Make photos for social media 
- All devices have Instagram, Twitter, whatever 

You can do that on 99% of all available phones and tablets.; Ah yes, gonna have to choose between fOoD and an iPhone 16 pro max. How much do you think basic groceries are/will be, regard?

Agree with your larger point about discretionary spend but anytime someone in this sub mentions “food is too expensive” (in the US), I just want to roll my eyes; Don't underestimate Apple brand loyalty. I bet there are people, who will cut corners in other parts of their lives (food, shelter) just to remain in that ecosystem (for the social ""status"" or whatever the fcuk they're getting out of it).; 🥱; I don’t think so. AI will rule. iPhone users will want their Siri to be ChatGPT.; They just increase prices. Manufacturing high tech is still a good deal for China.; Past decade.; **update:** shorting here would have made a nice profit; So they have nothing better to do with their money, got it.; Still holding my position; Lol mag7 are not hit as hard (they still get hit obviously). They are seen as safer bet; That’s BS lol, Apple’s in house chips are actually industry leading; they have to pay MSFT to use it. The hope for Apple bulls was that Apple would deliver their own ai product, not rent it from someone else. They failed.; They make their profit and high margins because they sell closed systems. 
This is also how they finance their development. 
There is no profit making their chips available to run operating systems they don’t control. 

By the way. You can get Apple hardware in the cloud.

Umm, no!  Bought a desktop in college for more than my first car, 1995.

$4,000 for the used car and $4800 for the lowest end desktop the school told me I had to buy.  Devices have gotten more powerful and a lot cheaper.  Accounting for inflation, these devices are even cheaper than the simple math for comparing a $4800 laptop to the lowest end Mac book.; [deleted]; I was referring to the general cost of living, this includes but is not limited to the rising cost of rent, the rising cost of power, the rising cost of food, the rising cost of health care, the rising cost of education, the rising cost daycare, the rising cost of (okay quality) clothing, the rising cost of entertainment, the rising cost of insurance. You get the point. Peoples expandable income is decreasing at an alarming rate and luxury items will be the first out the door for already the lower class and now the middle class.

"Nvidia Will Be the next Intel, Why I'm bearish long term. TSMC is the true winner(assuming China doesn't invade)","Right now, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Meta are all spending more than Nvidia on R&D and are developing their own AI chips. Tesla, and AMD are also developing AI chips. Right now, tech companies are only buying Nvidia's chips to get started and build market share, because they do not want to fall behind their competition. 

Using Nvidia's chips at current prices is not profitable, even successful AI companies such as OpenAI fail to achieve positive operating margins despite a highly popular product with paid features. Large tech companies are reluctantly buying Nvidia's hardware to avoid falling behind their competition in market share. But relying on Nvidia long term is never the intention, these companies need to be profitable eventually, Nvidia is just there to get them started.

The thing is, Nvidia's 74.56% gross margin is a strength, but its also a vulnerability. It demonstrates that any AI company that can cut out Nvidia can significantly reduce their costs, and that's why everyone is building their own chips. They don't need to be faster than Nvidia to succeed, they just need to be fast enough to provide services at a lower cost, which is quite a low bar. Developing new products takes time, which is why Nvidia's windfall has lasted. But give it 1-3 more years and you'll start to see the impact on Nvidia's sales.

With everyone rushing to develop their own chips, and all of them relying on TSMC, TSMC has the true windfall. They will certainly be able to hike their prices on wafers due to increased demand, which will hurt Nvidia's margins.

Intel was once a dominant and unstoppable player in the semiconductor space, but then they got too comfortable and started spending their cash flow on dividends and stock buybacks instead of reinvesting in R&D. We see how that played out, with AMD catching up and stealing market share, and now Intel is struggling. No moat is impenetrable.

Nvidia is following in Intel's footsteps with their $50 Billion stock buyback plan at 50x earnings. Despite facing competition from the largest tech companies with deep pockets, they are spending their record windfall just to buy back less than 2% of their shares outstanding. This will be their downfall. They are not hedging their reliance on TSMC by seeking to acquire or develop their own fab business, they are not increasing R&D sufficiently to stay ahead of their competition. This will be their downfall.

In 5-10 years, Nvidia will almost certainly have thinner margins and less market share in the AI space as their customers develop their own in-house solutions.

RemindMe! 10 Years; Don't bet against Jensen. The dude is smart as fuck and runs Nvidia like it could go bankrupt tomorrow. If you look back over the last 10 years, he has strategized and executed absolutely brilliantly.

  
Literally the only thing that can stop Nvidia's growth is the fact that it's running out of market to address.; If you are such a genius, back up your conviction with position. Or you are just a clown troll begging for attention 🤡; China will invade. Rip entire wall of text; [deleted]; You're stewpid; You must be regarded; chinese APTs taking deep footholds across american infrastructure to prepare for an invasion but sure it's safe to assume they won't *really* invade; Intel fell because its initial leadership of engineers who understood the products were replaced by business men who wanted to maximize shareholder value at the cost of the company. 

The only similarity between peak Intel and current Nvidia is that they’re both dominant players and lacking any real competition. 

TSMC is definitely a safe bet but a simple comparison between Nvidia and 2017 Intel’s capex will show you how utterly regarded this post is.; Chyna has been threatening to invade taiwan in the past 70 years. This is worse than the broken clock. ; Wait you’re that guy everyone flames in r/aoe4 💀💀; Microsoft tried to make phones how did that go ? How did the fire phone go ? Remember Google + ? 
You think one day you decide you want to be a pilot and then the next day you are one ? If they could make chips they would but they can’t; This dude has never used a computer; No; As long as Nvidia isn’t turning around in 7 years time to unveil their 5nm++++ process while literally paying people not to buy AMD cards, I can’t see them following the same trajectory 

For one, Jensen doesn’t even have to pay anyone not to buy AMD, he just rings up his cousin and tells her anything above 2gb gddr in the memory modules on her cards and she’s not invited to Christmas dinner.; I aint gonna read allat but you're fucking wrong OP thats all I can say; You're viewing the business relationship with TSMC as one-sided, but that's not the case. TSMC’s reliance on Nvidia as a major client means its pricing power may be more constrained. Outsourcing manufacturing isn’t a weakness. Apple doesn’t build its phones in-house, yet it remains one of the most dominant companies in the world.; -10.00% for the month.; I've been bearish the past 6 months, this post isn't anything new; Absolute mouth breather ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) OP, do you even have any puts or just foaming around?; Did I imply that they own the design? Without TSMC, Nvidia has no product because they do not own their own fab. And TSMC has lots of customers that will be lining up, willing to pay high prices to develop their own designs that compete with Nvidia. So Nvidia's margins are at the mercy of TSMC.; Give it 5 years and you will see.; >The Intel comparison? Nah fam. Intel got clapped because they couldn't figure out their manufacturing game. Meanwhile NVDA's playing 4D chess with their software ecosystem. CUDA got everyone by the balls.

Their entire business is dependent on a single company in Taiwan because Nvidia has no Fab at all. If TSMC doubles their prices, what are they going to do? Go to Intel? Samsung? Both of those have an inferior process. TSMC has all the power.

> Your OpenAI example's straight copium. They're losing money cause they're burning cash on compute to stay ahead, not cause of GPU costs. That's like saying Ferrari's gonna fail cause gas is expensive.

Compute is literally their operating costs. Without compute they have no product. What OpenAI is doing is like the equivalent of if I started an electricity company that charges $0.10 per kilowatt hour to customers, but pays a power plant $0.40 per kilowatt hour to produce it. It's not sustainable, but I base my business on hoping that eventually I can make my own power plant that produces electricity at $0.05 per kilowatt hour, and leverage existing market share to profit in the future.

>The real shit? Everyone and their mom trying to make AI chips just proves how massive this market is. More players = bigger pie.

They would not be developing their own chips if they did not think they had a chance at being a substitute for Nvidia's product. They do not need to produce a superior product to succeed, they just need to produce it at a lower cost than Nvidia's insane markup to avoid Nvidia's price gouging.; dyinggg; Holy shit.

AMD is the biggest opportunity in the Semi space ,"To the victor go the spoils and AMD beat Intel, so now its time to reap the rewards of being the biggest in their space. I think Intel will be sold and parts of their business bought out by various companies and the Fab business separated from the chip side of things. Leaving AMD as the go to company for microchips as they are miles ahead.

Look at your work or home computer, would it be able to run a next gen AI app or AI software in the next year or so?

There has been some concern this week with Micron and the PC business but i think the market is overlooking the fact that there is a massive upgrade cycle coming for AI personal computers. Think about all the outdated PC's that are currently out there. That's thousands of companies and corporations, Universities/colleges/schools, data centers and personal home computers that are not optimized for AI and the AI apps that will come down the pipeline next year. The addressable market is massive, this isn't limited to the US but think Europe, Asia, South America all looking to have an AI enabled PC in their office or home. You cant have the AI software development without having AI enabled PC's. Apple discovered this with their AI phones. You need upgrades on CPU's, Upgraded GPU's, Upgraded RAM and hard drives/storage.

Next lets talk about custom chip designs. The market went wild when Broadcom brought this up. No one realizes that AMD has been working on this for a while. They also make AI accelerators that directly compete with everyone else in performance. Their website has a list of their products this isnt something new they are jumping into.

Someone pointed this out yesterday in a similar post and now I can’t unsee it.

I sure think we are approaching an interesting entry point but these posts are just low effort.; ""to the victor go the spoils"" that would be NVDA. dont penny pinch here. buy the real deal and sleep easy.; Did ""AMD beat"" Intel or did Intel just...generally lose? It's not exactly the same thing.; The problem with AMD is too many Redditors are bullish on it. Inverse Reddit always wins. I'm waiting until most of you start claiming this stock as a scam.; Tesla uses the AMD Ryzen and other chips in all their cars - didn't realize this until today.

  
Bullish!; Im buying, everyone else is feeling max pain right now. This thing was over 200 this year, AMD has already usurped intel and its server sales for AI demand are skyrocketing. it will sell off until next earnings and then go back over 130 is my guess; The money went to Broadcom; buy time; I’m getting Intel Deja Vu from these posts lol; Yes, I agree. AMD is a good investment for long-term, but i think we are going to see low 90s before that.; Assets May Devalue; AMD’s AI story is dead .
90 incoming Note: I am a bag holder at 160. Selling covered calls to bring down the cost but it’s heart ache to see its fate for sure going to 90; Every time I see one of these AMD posts about how good it is the stock falls another 3%…everyone is posting about how good this company and meanwhile the stock is in full blown crash. I’m long at 137. Never seen a stock that’s supposedly so good, suck this bad. Already regretting choosing this over NVDA or even just Spy.

A lot of companies will flip back to Intel due to business development. I work in datacenter enterprise and Ive seen the flip to AMD. Intel just needs to release something decent for companies to buy their processors due to the “made in USA” aspect as well as diversification. Basically don’t confuse consumer sentiment with actual enterprise sales.; Wow, there's actually an AMD bull out there. Good luck! You need it.

>To the victor go the spoils and AMD beat Intel, so now its time to reap the rewards of being the biggest in their space.

The stock price has little to do with AMD's competitive position regarding Intel; you need to be thinking about whether AMD can gain share against Nvidia.

As it happens, AMD isn't beating Intel. For all Intel's struggles and AMD's successes, x86 market share is 3:1 in favor of Intel.

>i think the market is overlooking the fact that there is a massive upgrade cycle coming for AI personal computers. Think about all the outdated PC's that are currently out there.   
...  
You cant have the AI software development without having AI enabled PC's.

Many companies have been trying to sell that they can offer fast local inference, including AMD, but I don't see any actual demand for such services.

Most of the world is betting that AI is not really a PC thing. Microsoft is trying to make it a thing, but the investment dollars are going into the data center. The most likely future is like [chatgpt.com](http://chatgpt.com), which you can access via any device. No need for any number of TOPS on your local PC, or even a local PC.; AMD beat Intel, unfortunately for them they can't even compete well with Nvidia and the CPU duopoly they have enjoyed for years is at risk. ARM is already making inroads in laptops and servers. I don't see any reason x86 couldn't cease to be the mainstream in a decade or so. Their moat is shrinking.; I'm long AMD, bought in 2022 and up >50% currently. I do agree the stock was too high, if it dips to near $100 I will increase my position. Looking forward to seeing what the next 5 year outlook is.; AMD is undervalued. My perception is that it is out of favor at the moment, but will not skyrocket up, thus taking time to grind higher. I am holding AMD, NVDA and AVGO.  Bottom line everything needs a semi chip nowadays so exposure to semis is needed. SMH another possibility if ETF preferred; Another factor is that it’s led by Lisa Su - another engineer CEO and who has been around for about a decade now. She orchestrated the rise of Ryzen. So for sure AMD is in good hands.; Nvidia is king and already has plans to enter CPU market, If AI stumbles.

AMD has failed to execute on their AI strategy thus far.  They need to topple CUDA but dont have the SW engineers to do it.

NVDA is king.; I think you may have misspelled SMCI.; I've been traumatized by both AMD and SMCI. I could never buy either again.; Let me be *absolutely* clear here.


Ive worked repairing PCs for the longest time. The ""mindshare"" that people both young and old (mostly young) have that nvidia cards are THE BEST. Is mind boggling.


Very RARELY if EVER, do kids come in and ask for AMD cards. Always Nvidia.


NOW, regarding AI. AMD will not take advantage of the AI trend unless more open source work is done to make it as seamless a process as it is for nvidia users. And that trend will bubble up to more mainstream populous. That is a fact. Once you see news in the small communites that AMD cards have this new fangled open source program thats easy to install, sure, jump on and dump a few k to hold for a couple years.


Fin.; Maybe but I’m sad; We have one of these weekly now. We started at $160 down to $130 and now $118. 

Biggest semi opportunity is Nvidia. Based on analyst expectations they’re poised to double again in the next 2 years. 

AMD isn’t going to grow just because it had a bad year. It jumped 128% in 2023 despite not having much AI datacenter revenue. This year the stock has repriced since their AI revenue is still tiny next to Nvidia. Next year they’re expected to double again $10b in AI sales and 55% margin compared to $160b and 75% margin for Nvidia.

Buy AMD if you want but it would be a fraction of your Nvidia position.; I’m sure they can topple Apple backed Broadcom; I like MRVL.; Shhh don’t let people look at the balance sheet before I get another 100; No Intel is; > Guidance keeps going up. This stock is recession proof.

What's the PT Barnum saying again?; uh ARM much?; AMD being pushed everywhere. Seems like you should wait for a real bottom.; My Poker-playing gut says this will run eventually but might need a very positive catalyst otherwise it will continue to bleed. Fundamentals are overrated in this Yolo Robinhood era we find ourselves in.; I believe. I bought, I bought too early by 8.3%. might buy more when this time I'm certain slump is over; It’s not tariff proof.; Now it'll definitely drop another 50%; Lmao this is much worse than the Intel analysis. A lot of words with basically close to none in substance. At least the Intel post talked about innovations made that is pulling the company forward.; Meh, nah. Your post all depends on a big assumption about Intel, doesn't give any reasoning why that'll happen, and also doesn't take into account any of Intel's strategies. They just started making GPUs and already have  competitive products for price tier. In 1-2 years this could flip the script where Nvidia is coming to them to make their GPUs instead of TSMC. Intel also has several key technological advantages they are incorporating into next-gen CPUs coming 2025. They are in hot-water right now and seemingly at a make it or break it point, but I think it's too early to call it.; I’m not making that mistake again with AMD, I thought I bought it at a right time and it went down massively. A lot of bullish articles then. I waited, but did not came back up so I sold. Then literally 2wks later it went up a lot. I see the same pattern, now I just wait it out. If it’s not in the coming months, then we will see some returns in the coming years. Technology is the future of humans anyways and we always will need a computer, so lets see how AMD will behave next year!; Even at 90 usd per share more expensive then Nvidia, like wtf and they dont even have such dominant position, for me, Nvidia is a Winner and the share orice doesnt reflect that, Look Avgo or Tesla P/E pure hype madness; I get pleased when I'm red on AMD and I buy more every time I am. When it's time for me to retire in 40 years I'll look back and thank myself ; This ai upgrade cycle is a myth.; Woman Jensen ain’t pulling her weight; Let it bottom near 100 then I’ll be interested; Have you seen the reviews of the latest ARC GPUs?
Intel is already not able to meet the demand and might become profitable as a company soon.; AMD - Angry Mean Dips; Amazon going to make its own chips. Like rn, almost everyone is going into this, therefore competition is going higher and higher. Who knows, *who* will make something revolutionary next; In this market, attractive valuation is actually a suspect.; AMD is the new intel and that’s a good thing?; So what is the bear case on this stock? Because with a PEG ratio of 0.31, it does seem like a screaming buy.; Intel dropped the ball horribly and in the zero sum game of capitalism it's now on its way out; I sold at 200 something  (203 maybe?) because that was my goal when I bought. Then when it ""dipped"" to 160 got excited and jumped back in because of the ""opportunity"". I've averaged a few times on a few other ""dips"".  Still not feeling this damn opportunity. I think the only dip(shit) here is me (and many of you).; Do consumers really buy PCs anymore though?; AMD is a laggard, sorry; HA NO; NVIDIA will always do better than AMD; Tax loss harvesting is coming next week. New 52 week low incoming.; Inverse reddit. 

Time to short it.; AMD is doomed. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|downvote); -20% in not a good opportunity; Can AMD do an NVDA and hit 1k? Why or why not.; Amd shareholders seem to be going through a lot of pain because I see so many posts about AMD. I’m not in it but I’m also not interested in buying because semis have been lagging the broader market. I wouldn’t even touch NVDA, let alone AMD. If you recently bought, take the loss and move on.; YTD negative in a bull market. Just how?!; Just buy NVDA at this point, it dropped at s good level; Advanced Money Destroyer is gonna get you!; AMD owes me money. Please buy the stock so I can at least come out even and invest in Nvidia.; I thought it was INTC trading below 19$ and AMD will soon drop to $105; I work in the semiconductor sector and I can tell you that it is a risky move to buy AMD right now. Just because an industry becomes popular and mainstream doesn't mean it is a profitable high margin business or makes the stakeholders rich. Look at Intel between 2000-2020. On paper, they should have been like Nvidia. Monopoly everywhere which was high margin and relegating ARM to the king of cheap chips (no pun intended). I can assure you that if we cannot monetize AI in 2025, VC money is going to get dry and all these AI startups are going to go out of business because they are not making money. It is going to be like the .com bubble, some AI companies will survive and in 10 years we will have amazing products (basically Microsoft and the other FANG companies). Actually, that is the most likely scenario, rather than automagically making AI truly useful in 2025. In this case, everyone will take a hit, Nvidia, Intel, AMD, Apple, Meta, yada yada. I would wait until that happens to get AMD really cheap. Not financial advice though ;); AVGO already is dominating custom and has the three biggest customers in the market, why would they suddenly lose market share to AMD?; AMD is a second tier company that got lucky with Ryzen and hasn't done anything significant since.; The pe is over 100.  Isn't that wildly expensive?; How do they deserve a 100PE with much slower fro than NVDA with a 50PE?; Yeah, no; Advanced Manic Depression; Advanced money destroyer; Again more declines; Arghh My Dick; Automatic moolah depletion; All money disappear; Always Moving Down; INTC entered the chat lol; Inverse Reddit. I’m tempted to jump back in now 

What’s Jim Cramer saying about AMD!; Really? I have seen so many people are hyped that the stock is beaten down this much like don't get me wrong, I think it's undervalued as well at this price but everyone on reddit has been so optimistic that I have been hesitating to buy.; ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|upvote)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face); Especially if they hire a good CEO instead of one hired not for their abilities. ; This is really happening. Check inside trades. Lisa Su & gang is buying fistfuls.; Karp needs to join the cabinet as Secretary of Defense.

At this point, nothing matters anymore so everyone should just buy PLTR and roll with it; I’ve made a lot of money on AMD LEAPS in the past 5 years. It’s a cyclical stock I’ve noticed, I usually go as far as possible out and manage through there. Also a great PMCC stock if you manage correctly.; VIX is crazy high rn. Options premiums are pumping and AMD is no different; *Conceptually* AMD could be a great value because there is some unknown but large TAM growth ahead and they *could* become a solid \#2 supplier to NVDA in a big and rapidly growing market. If that *does* play out and AMD has industry normal margins then earnings growth is taking off and maybe they maintain a nice ~30 forward PE multiple as long as revenue keeps growing. Simple.


The hard part is how likely is that scenario? Cloud server CPU TAM could well be declining in the face of the robust competition and all vendors offering cost/core to drive down hardware price, and hyperscalers are prioritizing investment in GPU capacity. This was AMD's most dominant market and it's no longer sexy.


Client and gaming markets are going nowhere. Embedded is going to stay depressed until at least late 25 or 26.


So the fate of the stock is all on GPU and it's highly uncertain how much success they will have.; Totally agree, the stock comp for this stock is gross. It doesn’t feel like management has shareholders best interest at heart; With a $3.2 trillion market cap I think they conquered the market many times over; A bit of both and the end result is the same; INTC net loss of -16.6B in 3rd quarter; This will never gonna happen, when it dropped to 150 ppl say “this is a good time to buy”, same in 130, 120, and future 110 or even 90. And if you really hold your belief you should just buy put.; Yes and a boatload of nvidia too.; And it’s much better than intel atom from before; Ok so things get priced in the moment you realize it?; It’s negative ytd dude; Here, you dropped something:  /s; Gonna make Grandma proud.; Low 90?? AMD destroyed all my money already; So sell at this point?; I was looking at it last night $85ish was my target. ; If this is true I have no idea what people see in AMD. I feel like the CPU market is theirs to lose atm.; LOL their AI story has been dead since last year and the stock was slowly bleeding the entire year. The revenue is growing quarter over quarter which means they are still growing but they will NEVER see the explosive growth NVDA saw; It doesn't suck, it was just overpriced because everyone hoped it would take off like Nvidia any day now and that didn't happen. But it may grow substantially as it grows more sustainably in the years to come.; My cost basis is 38. Sold at 176. Ran over 200.... now on the way back down. Once it bottoms out it'll be severely undervalued and I'll buy back in. Likely between here and 100.; AMD isn't a great company imo. They've always struggled with having decent software ; What’s your take on Sierra Forest/Granite Rapids and then Clearwater Forest/Diamond Rapids next year. Also their Gaudi offering. Nice to hear from someone who actually works in a relevant field - do you think Intel is becoming competitive again, and able to hold their ground in the market share?; This; AMD Fwd PE: 36 

NVDA Fwd PE: 43; AI won't stumble anytime soon.; CUDA is really it. The vast majority of Machine Learning software out their relies heavily on CUDA and unless AMD can improve ROCm and make it enticing enough to software developers, companies will pay the Nvidia tax for GPU compute power.; This ""mindshare"" concept holds more value in products like APPL and TSLA. There is brand loyalty and social status in owning them. 

For products like GPU and CPUs, as soon as one brand's product straight up performs better, people will jump ship. I'm not saying AMD GPUs will beat NVidia in performance any time soon. But look at how quickly Intel dropped off as soon as x3D chips from AMD got crowned the king of gaming performance.; Last time I tried AMD gpu was 2018 when everyone was saying they were great again and had non stop driver issues in old games. Nvidia almost never has issues and you can see despite amd having only 20% of gpu market share they have as many issue threads on driver issues. Nvidia is worth the premium for peace of mind ; AMD aside, it's endearing to find someone sincerely believing ""analyst expectations"".; Intel could explode or implode on itself like a diaretic anus running in reverse.

I have a small position that I am willing to gamble on.; Over the next 3 years? Sure. In 2025 it will be lucky to reach it's March 2024 high; I love it how people only start caring about PEs once I enter a stock… when AMD was ripping at 200 never heard one person mention the PE. Now that I’m long at 137 everyone is a value investor all of the sudden “oh look at the expensive PE” comical. ; aint making dollars; Buy the dip for more depression?! Or save some therapy money; Ain't Makin' Dough.

yet; This was the only one that actually made me laugh; Just sold it for his dumpy trust; The opinions on it seem mixed. Considering Lisa Su won CEO of the year and AMD YTD is down considerably (in comparison to its competitors in big tech) the consensus on this has been sour. The fundamentals are good, cash to debt ratio is at 2+, their debt to equity ratio is good. People are just spoiled now with quick gains. This is a long term hold, so not only your money is invested but so is your time.; Where do you see that? Most recent inside trades I see are Lisa Su selling & selling up till 4th Dec.; No she didn’t she sold shares which is not unusual or uncommon for tax loss harvesting.; Wrong.; I bought a little after the election to swing trade the grift and it's the only winner I have picked in quite some time; He was even on Bill Maher recently. Also his hair is less crazy than in 2021 which is clearly bullish.; It's not going back down, might as well stop complaining and get on the train; If been going full Lichello with AMD since my entry at $15 per share.; 
The Gaming sector has been falling double digits and the margin evaporated.; Hot garbage. Yay AMD a solid play for #2 position, why not just buy #1?; Nvda forward pe is 30 and AMD is 24. Volume of sales is just so much higher with nvda and not likely to slow down soon; And it should be higher. They are the best to ever do it in the semi space. Give them their $10T spoils (in time).; But the Nvidia tegra before the atom was absolutely horrible. Such high failure rates and unbearable lag; [removed]; No shit Sherlock. This might be going over your head but Some people like buying when stocks are red not green lmao; What’s your strategy? Buy high sell low?; In a bigger sell off. It might hit that level, but If I were you I would hold onto my AMD position for long-term. Lisa Su knows what she is doing!; I would not say sell, but rough early next year. I think there will be a correction.; Never say never, dont know what coud happend in the future; They were in the exact same position regarding Intel.; God these comments are uninformed and you sound so convinced. Tell me, what’s Nvidia’s guidance for earnings in 2025? What about AMD’s?; Honestly more and more ppl are willing to buy it when it continues to drop. Almost EVERYONE is stuck inside now and if someone gets in at this moment, he will likely make a profit; Yes their new hardware is looking good. Enterprise just needs a reason to buy and they will - basically we buy Intel procs and they buy our product and then both us put our logos up in each others “partners” page and promote each other. Standard business dev. However Intel screwed up last two releases and as hardware architects we simply could not use them in our builds because AMD was too far ahead. We will be using intels new processors and will see how those go but they look okay on paper. Having two vendors is also ideal because it lets us source from two different supply chains which reduces risk. It’s not all just about performance there are several factors to consider. I work at a Fortune 500 cloud software company. 

If Intel can deliver at least close to AMD products they will do okay. Their brand recognition is not “dead” but it did make them miss a few upgrade cycles from a lot of companies. Not sure about guadi but we are looking at trying AMD GPUs next round.; AMD forward PE is only 22.; On what projected growth rates?

Maybe I’m mistaken but AMD has shown negative earnings growth while NVDA’s growth has been staggering.; 
This has already happened in the CPU space after INTC shit the bed on their current gen processors. AMD has become the new in demand gold standard CPU; >But look at how quickly Intel dropped off as soon as x3D chips from AMD got crowned the king of gaming performance.

X3D is great stuff technically, but it only has meaningful value for a tiny segment of gamers - the ones who build their own high end desktop. Most gamers buy laptops. Most gamers who buy desktops buy prebuilts. Go look at the Dell Alienware, Lenovo Legion, or HP Omen storefronts. I can't find a mention of X3D anywhere. Among gamers who build their own, most don't have a budget that justifies buying even a 7800X3D, let alone a 9800X3D.; Your affinity for reading the thesaurus is endearing; Dude think about what you just said. The stock was ripping to $200 on the ""hope"" that it will see explosive growth, which it did not and most likely will not see. Will it continue growing? Sure but that doesn't justify a $200 share price and it has deservedly been crushed this year unless they somehow ramp up growth more in their AI chips; AMD and the infinite dip; Just bought another 4k, great to hear; If you think a stock will grow based on debt and cash, I have bad news for you.; Bro, #sarcasm! Are we really thinking the post that I replied to, is not sarcastic?; Genuine question.

The price was 30 something at the time of airing.. I was def considering buying but the company is also owned by peter thiel so I couldnt pull the trigger.  Its going to do great tho.; As a consumer when it comes to the gaming gpus, I personally regret buying NVDIA and will be looking at AMD as my next purchase.

NVIDIA got a lead due their shiny features (Ray-Tracing and DLSS) but in the end I found the jump from the 1080ti to the 3080 not to be as amazing as I expected.

At least from that perspective I do think AMD will continue to have room to gain their market share back.; AMD could triple with a 20% market share. What's NVDA gonna do in a couple years? 10T market cap? Why not 20T? 50T?


The time to hold #1 was a 5bagger ago, and I did, and I still do; Yes and NVDA is overvalued right now while AMD is undervalued. Source DCF model. So sure NVDA to the moon but AMD has way more catch up to do and that’s very valuable to the future earnings potential of a dollar invested. Competition is healthy and AMDs focus on accelerators and AI networking seems to be pointing to a potential breakout.

AMD earnings growth forecast is 40% and trading 40% below value vs NVDA earnings growth forecast is 25% and trading 25% over.

NVDA is huge and will pull big numbers but a dollar invested in AMD today, in my opinion will return more than a dollar invested in NVDA today over say a 5-10 year timeframe.; Volume of sales doesn’t matter that just has to do with market cap. NVDA growth is decelerating and AMD growth is accelerating.; The trailing pe is over 100 why is the forward pe gonna be so much different?; [deleted]; Good one ; How did you know u/LordBagdanoff's real name is Sherlock?; Why buy amd when u can get NVDA at almost the same price lol; That’s interesting, thanks. I’ve seen a lot of people say, “Intel don’t have a chance, as once a data center switches, it’s almost impossible for them to switch back”. Seems like this isn’t true then. I guess the hardware is probably updated every 1-3 years and you just evaluate what is the best fit in terms of value for money & performance.; You’re mistaken indeed. 

Negative earnings growth? 

GAAP Y/Y Net income last qtr 

For Amd: 158% 
And for Nvda: 109%

Absolutely no idea how people are believing Nvda is a better opportunity currently; > Among gamers who build their own, most don't have a budget that justifies buying even a 7800X3D, let alone a 9800X3D.

5800x3D ($175 USD currently in aus) exists and is considered one of the greatest chips ever made.

7800x3d was sold out everywhere in every country for a long time. And when the 9800x3d launched it sold out everywhere within minutes. It has way better thermals, energy efficiency, and price to performance ratio than Intel's latest gen chips. (In gaming) That's crazy if you think about it, running on less power and lower temperatures but still outperforming Intel's flagships.

But yes it's not a huge market like NVIDIA has in AI. But I wasn't using this to boost AMD sentiment. I was merely pointing out that ""mindshare"" people have don't really translate to hardware like GPU and CPUs. IF by miracle  AMD makes a better GPU than NVIDIA, everyone will switch instantly. But no matter how great an Android phone is made, or if a BYD vehicle can outperform Tesla in every metric, people will not switch over easily.; Just funny how sentiment works. Everyone loves PLTR at 360 PE right now. AMD has been nearly cut in half from its peak and everyone who loved it at 220 hates it at 120. Every individual stock is litterally a pump in dump. ; If you have other gains to offset, it is almost always advantageous to harvest the tax loss. And if you still want to own it, you can always buy back in after 30 days.; When you think the stock is going to go down you should sell.; That's why I bought loads of Raytheon after Biden appointed a Raytheon board member as Sec of Defense. Right on cue the US started sending billions in Raytheon product to Israel and Ukraine!; bro 3080 is old af just get a 4090; Invest in both to diversify; NVDA's PEG ratio is 0.97, indicating that it's pretty close to fair value. AMD would have to triple in price to reach the same PEG.; Was replying to the previous message implying nvda reached its peak; Because the way the Xilinx acquisition was done. That’s what artificially drives up the current pe; Ha, except we have regulation now so it’s not really anything like that.; His mum told me when we were having a shag; the price of one actual share isn't relevant right? last year nvidia approached (surpassed?) $1000 per share, so they did a 10-to-1 stock split; Comments like this show how clueless redditors are; Brain cells have left the chat; Crazy they just let anyone open a brokerage account nowadays; Bruh; Lol what is market cap?; Bruh; Yeah whomever said it’s hard to switch back is absolutely wrong. Every company that “switched” to AMD came from Intel ecosystem and is now currently mixed and is likely doing fine. I know this first hand. So really, switching “back” might even be easier in some respects (amd does have a few extra knobs to get max perf from their cpus where intel are more straight forward).  Yeah im at a fairly large cloud company with many datacenters and we design yearly server builds with one being “new” and the next years is just a spec bump/refresh. So usually we work about 2 years out so 2-3 years to see a change in spending is fair.; Haha same!!! No actually I do, because I can clearly see most people don’t actually look at any important fundamentals. They shout about PE and Forward PE but they can’t even explain why it’s what it is. They don’t understand acquisitions or earnings forecasts or relative strength or the time value of a dollar.; >5800x3D ($175 USD currently in aus) exists and is considered one of the greatest chips ever made.

Without question, it's an amazing part. The list of people for whom it's a good idea to buy the thing is pretty short, though. It makes sense as a final upgrade for an aging AM4 system with say a Zen+ in it. For a new build, you're better served buying something else.

When it was a new part, it had the same overkill problem that 9800X3D has today. 9800X3D makes sense if you are building with a $2000+ budget and you have no productivity use case. There just aren't a ton of people like that. Gamers have mostly been well served to buy sub-$300 CPUs these past few generations. 

>I was merely pointing out that ""mindshare"" people have don't really translate to hardware like GPU and CPUs. IF by miracle AMD makes a better GPU than NVIDIA, everyone will switch instantly.

Everyone still hasn't switched to AMD from Intel in CPU land. Actually not even close. Intel still has 75% market share in x86 CPUs.; I wouldn't say AMD is a pump and dump, they are a good and profitable company that is also growing. But they were priced to be like an NVDA; >When you think the stock is going to go down you should sell.

After the stock has already gone down. So by that logic you're following the age old advice of selling low and buying high.; Diversification is another word for being a pussy. Half joking; Regulations are meaningless unless enforced. I don’t see the Trump admin enforcing much on this front…; Just leave these types to their ignorance; Well my $ is safer with NVDA 😛; Lmao joker; In the gaming CPU land it's a pretty major shift. There are many more use cases for x86 CPUs that x3D chips don't excel at, hence the market share number (wherever that's sourced from). Again I'm not arguing about AMD vs others. I'm just using AMD as an example.; Most regulations are local and it’s a wild leap to think companies will now be able to break federal law with no enforcement. Presidents in the US aren’t kings even if he wishes he were.; nah why not help them out - maybe it will get them started in investing n shit. or maybe i missed their point entirely; If you want safety why not go for t bills ; I hope you’re right, but banks and big tech are celebrating his win from an M&A perspective…; No you didn't miss any point. They're comparing stock prices at face value without regard for float/market cap"
Has anyone heard of an app called Silo markets?,"Hey all. I recently came across a video from Ryan Scribbner talking about an app called Silo markets, it seems to be a slick app for folks seeking bond investments, the vision seems to be designed for gen z, the UI seeming very Robinhoody... As I did research and followed his referral, it took me to this page of the app store. No android, or online option. 

However the reviews seem pretty solid, does anyone have more information how to get it on Android? Rn I'm with Fidelity but I'm not enjoying their software and there are hoops to jump through when buying or even browsing bonds. So I'm always open for new options.
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/silo-markets-bonds-indexes/id1630228218?see-all=reviews  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hi0rfk/has_anyone_heard_of_an_app_called_silo_markets/,0,2024-12-19 20:21:55,"I don't understand why people get drawn into these tiny little startups.

Silo is a tiny investment advisor that is only registered in Texas as an SEC 203A-2 advisor (ie an internet advisor).

They literally have only 2 employees who are probably the guys that wrote the app. 

They managed using Interactive Brokers - probably Ibkr's advisor platform. And their app probably is just a front-end for Ibkr's API.

As of April 2024 - they had the grand total of $23k in AUM. That's K as in thousands with about 283 customers.

It doesn't even look like a real company. They have raised no venture money that I can see. And it looks like a part-time project.

I'm not suggesting that it's a horrible company - but this company is more in the playing around stage.; Hey, that's already a ton of information that users wouldn't know, you seem to have gone down the silo rabbit hole if that's accurate, I appreciate it. However re-read my OP I do  mention that it's Robinhoody lol what I meant by that is the interface is sexy and to people like me who value simplicity, and tech savvy software over complexity, and corporate bank software silo is attractive, start-up or not. 

It's precisely why I'm here creating this thread in the first place, I'm not enjoying the fidelity process I'm using now, and every CUSIP or whatever has long ass names, and opens new tabs to see the bond details and then another to proceed with the buy."

Increase rates anticipating tariffs and deportation inflation and he would look like he is making decisions based on politics since he is not going by current numbers but rather what Trump is stating he will do. He would be making decisions on forward looking statements and speculation. 

Decreasing rates because of current data will make those who speculate take more loans and max their credit cards thinking that inflation will go sky high.

Consumers and businesses will be taking high risk buying things they don't need or want only because they think it will increase in value. Those items may not increase in value and if they do and they have adjustable rate credit cards or loans, their interests may increase higher than the inflation. 

Hoarding groceries only leads to more wasted food from spoilage. Even frozen food doesn't last too much past 6 months without freezer burn or lower quality. Rice, pasta, cereals can attract rodents and insects.  Canned foods last for years, but very easy to over buy and not consume because you know it lasts a long time and forget them. 

I know many people don't believe in trickle down economics, but it is in the best interest of the businesses to give 1/3 to lower prices, 1/3 to profits, and 1/3 to employees if they want to have conservatives win in 2028.

The lower corporate taxes, income taxes, and deregulation is an opportunity for the businesses to make voters happy and thus win the next election. 

Deportation is an opportunity to purchase drones to do agriculture and other work that immigrants usually do. They can say they give humans priority but since there are no humans applying, they have to resort to drones.

I sold the lot at that point (5965) because it signals a lot more potential downside, and if nothing else some real uncertainty.  I went from being up >100% for the year to down 20% all because I wanted to minimize tax burned this year.  I'm a dingus.  I was successful in minimizing tax burden, though.  So that's a big win. 

I bet we rebound tomorrow but choppy water until 2026.; I mean look around. The world’s fucked but the stock markets at all time highs? Markets about to come tumbling down this is just the beginning.; Nice one! I also like ""If in doubt, math it out!"" 😁; Escalator up, elevator down!; or a recession; With my luck it will go sideways, nobody wins.; So would be 10% up this year, pretty solid return.; Amateur clowns acting tough; 🤑; Whoa! I hope you're careful, they're killing the CEOs out there; Yeah that's the problem, I was DCAing into Nvidia all week thinking and buying the discount and didn't realize that the real discount was still ahead of me , wasted all the ""dry powder""; Where's that Patrick meme when you need it!!; Do it! You won’t! No balls!; WEALTH; Kinda sucks to have most of my cash deployed already… what do i do?; Haha, same here.; I honestly add to my positions everyday no matter what, but on days like today I just increase the amount.; In the end most will still rise anyways unless there's ww3, so who cares.; Then I’ll keep buying at lower prices; Lol. What decision? They made the decision they were expected to make. Interest rates are already historically low. If they cut rates every time there's a decision they'll have to start paying people to borrow money.  Does the market expect the fed to start paying people to borrow money?; Need to zoom out fellow Redditor.
Look at today already.; The last 4 haven't been? The 4 after won't be?; Raise em to the the moon; was not surprising news either though; Big if true.; This is Patrick; 🤣🤣🤣 the one where you can check the stocks; I doubt we will even get 2; Ah yes you like to buy high sell low right?; Hahahha more red tomorrow; Weird you're getting downvotes lol; Bet you feel like a fool today; Yes exactly, and then 2022 was the correction; It absolutely is market manipulation.  Powell took a non-political position and made it political.  He downplayed inflation for most of the year and then in September basically said inflation is no longer a problem, cut the rate by 50 bps and announced there would be 4 cuts in 2025.  This had 2 very predictable outcomes.  It caused the market to go up leading into the election and it also caused the most recent inflation numbers to rise.  Since the market had already priced in the 4 cuts he previously said this announcement yesterday caused the big drop to where the market probably should have already been.; Finviz. Asking is kindof a meme whenever it’s posted, so I posted since nobody else had yet.; You can buy any color as long as it’s red.; Even crypto?; Reasoning: this sucker’s going up; So there might be one more sell off before year end? NO WAY; Nonsense the market only expected 25 bps and two cuts next year was widely discussed. This is political madness by T& M nothing else !; If you think Powell or anyone has a crystal ball to make rate cut predictions for 2025 you’re seriously mistaken, those are possible guidelines, anything can happen between now and the future.; A 2% market drop made you go from 100%+ to 20%-?

Are you leveraged 100x??; Man you aren't good at this stuff. You lost more than 50% yesterday? Maybe today you can zero it out.; You’re going to lose all your money day trading SPY against algos and HFTs. Good lucks; Homie it sounds like that was on you and poor risk management. 2025 is gonna hurt when you watch markets climb higher... and 2026 we probably nuke.; The worlds been fucked up my entire lifetime but markets always went up; Remember covid? The market rebounded so high some financial gurus on TV were embarrassed. This is the amazing thing about the market...; I lived thru the dotcom bubble right out of college, the great recession in 2008, and COVID in 2020 and I'm still UP. You're pessimistic outlook will do you no good in the markets.; That recession lasted 12h; Dca over a week? And you think you can time the market like that? Lol freaking reddit man; U have unlimited daily funds or something?; You should look into Dollar Cost Averaging; You're spoiling the plot for the aliens watching us; You may very well do that. I'm personally shorting, I made $3000 today.; If it was expected the market wouldn't have bolted like it did.; My comment was made about the previous days trading.. \[rolling eyes\]

btw, yeah, its end of the ""today"" you speak of ..and the market is still shit..; Was very surprising news. It was basically a pivot. They are forecasting higher rates for longer. If it wasn’t surprising, the market wouldn’t have reacted the way it did.; Small if false.; It’s finfiz heat map bud; RemindMe! 1 Year; Be fearful when others are greedy, greedy when others are fearful. I'll take my 4.25% interest for now and be content with it; Why? This is the most overvalued S&P has ever been.

Lots of better opportunities around the world.

If the markets closed for 5years, I'd rather be holding to foreign stocks paying 6 to 10% div yields vs US stocks paying 1%; It is their official prerogative to set monetary policy and there will be always change in policy from time to time, obviously. They don't manipulate, they set policy.

These changes are made especially clear and in advance. It was known before the meeting what the Fed would announce with near certainty. 

The Fed use data like inflation + job reports + the global economy outlook. And the data mandated the slight policy change.  Their decision was reasonable and expected. You could read many articles in the news before that explained what would be the change.

If you can't even manage that and wet you pants for 1 day of fluctuations and have to complain about market manipulation for that,  you should not do short term trading.

If you invest for your retirement in 20 years, why complain of having a small sale ?; What about that green shadowy place?

That’s beyond our borders. We must never go there Simba.; Bitcoin, Not Crypto.; That's not a stock; How many trading days we got before the new year? We could have multiple days of sell offs before then! 🤣  Especially if our wonderful congressmen and congresswomen shut down the government right before Xmas… 🎅 🎄🧑‍🎄🧑‍🎄; Trying to day trade the SPY on 15 minute intervals is surely a winning strategy long term; That account as of late is high risk high reward because it's all play money in the end and this is a fun game.  I have more stable allocations that I sit on. 

That loss in that account over the last months isn't a realized loss; it's a loss in position value and I'm not worried about it because that account is still up way more than I ever expected.  What I'm doing is working there, I just didn't follow my own rules.  

I sold when it broke through second resistance because it signaled more downside, but I bought back at at healthy discount in premarket. 

I left a big chunk on the sidelines because this (over) correction isn't quite over, and I'm looking to average down.  SPX closed key resistance of 5972 yesterday, and there's good chance we'll see a bounce at 5840-5850, which will be my next buy in point to these riskier assets.    

Yes, I deviated from my general thesis because next year I'm not taking any income and investing a lot into my own businesses and didn't want to take the 40% tax hit when I can take a lesser hit next year.  So I held too long.; My position as of late is high risk high reward because it's all play money in the end and this is a fun game.  

That loss over the last months isn't a realized loss; it's a loss in position value and I'm not worried about it because I'm still up way more than I ever expected.  It's house money.   

I sold yesterday but I bought back at at healthy discount in premarket this morning.  

I left a big chunk on the sidelines because this shakeup isn't over, and I'm looking to average down.  SPX closed key resistance of 5972, and there's good chance we'll see a bounce at 5840-5850, which will be my next buy in point.  

 I deviated from my general thesis because next year I'm not taking any income and investing a lot into my own businesses next year and didn't want to take the 40% tax hit this year when I can take a lesser hit next year. So I held when I probably shouldn't have.; its really not that hard if the markets bullish  , trick is to accumulate , then dump

buy dips, sell peaks ,  if its not dipping or peaking , put like 1$ on it and pretend like its a fortune, lol then buy the future 'dips' with real allocations; it can happen to anyone, some of these crazy market volatility unprecented 2024

i mean i lost a grand in doge when it -25 + 25  in like 12 hours ,    if timed better or if i heldm y last position id be up grands,   

also i sold doge coin to buy kamala contracts and lost like 6k 

doge went up 25% right after

just because you make a bad trade, doesnt mean your bad at this.

just try to minimize your losses and move on and start growing again

btw you may want to stabalize your liqudity after a loss 

ie instead of doublign down or trying to make a quick buck real fast

  
dump the money on bonds a high yield cash for a few till u start again

prevents massive losses; Yeah you’re probably 20 then. Before you people could afford a house, car, family, groceries etc working at fords.; But but they said lump sum was better 🤣; I'm not timing the market necessarily rather if it's a company like NVDA or META that I think is fundamentally solid and will have significantly more upside than downside in coming years, when the stock price drops below my cost basis for one transient reason or another, I start buying into it every day on the way down until it rises back up above my cost basis. When I say DCA, is that I don't throw all of the uninvested cash I'm willing to put into it all at once once it drops below my cost basis but rather a percentage of it every day as I don't know how low it will go. Before this week it was above what I paid for it and I had no particular incentive to go buy more. Not really any timing the market per se involved here; I lost $10,000, so you’re welcome. 😉😂; The market is full regard. It will stay that way longer than your smarts. The fed has stayed really true to their timeline. No one ever thought inflation was fixed. The new presidency probably has a bigger effect on this than jpow.; Again. Zoom out dude; Finally!!; Wow!

|-|-|-|-|; Calm down.  Nobody is wetting their pants (or at least I'm not, maybe others are).  I actually think the current course is correct.   The problem was the September meeting where the economic data did not warrant a 50 bps rate cut or the announcement of 4 2025 cuts.  I think what came out of that meeting was largely political.  You can disagree.  The pullback yesterday is absolutely a reaction to the Feds about face since the last meeting.   Honestly the market has been overheated lately and was due for a pullback anyway.; actually u can make pretty good returns just use spxl or spxs   its 3x up or down , almost no bid ask spread,  in out at ez pricing; That hasn’t been the case since at least 30 years ago and the market has absolutely crushed throughout that time. ; So did I 😭; F; What you are saying is just not correct.  Powell cutting 50 bps in September and saying there would be 4 more cuts in 2025 was a sign to the market that inflation was fixed.  The 4 rate cuts were already factored into the market which is why there was a big selloff after Powell cut that to only 2 yesterday.  Saying the new president, who isn't even in office yet, had a bigger impact on yesterdays downturn than the guy who tried to manipulate the market leading into an election is laughable.; This is still not an issue really.

Different people will have different opinion but the Fed behavior is consistent.

They wanted a strong signal initially after waiting for a long time to lower rates. They did it and the market, economist and most people interested in the subject, got that message. The rationale was to not risk the economy with job report that were so-so at the time.

Now as things as going well on the economy and employment but on the other side the inflation is not lowering anymore, they refine their policy that is basically instead of lowering total of 2% from September to the end of 2025, they will likely lower 1.5%. That's fine and logical.

And we all know that if events/reports show that it is necessary they will change again the plan.

Their are steering the stuff with the data they have and do refine/change policy when they think is necessary. No reason to speak of market manipulation or whatever even if we don't all agree with the way they steer it in the small details.; Overall, yeah. But 2000 2008 2022 still exist and many new investors who just joined at this high may not be as well positionned as someone who had lot of time to compound; It’s still been a helluva year.; He did not say that. He said they would be cautious cutting rates and continue to monitor inflation. In September he specifically said they weren't going to cut rates every meeting.; I appreciate the thoughtful discussion.  I disagree that ""the Fed behavior is consistent"".  Inflation never got down to the target of 2%.  That is why throughout the year they held rates steady while at the same time suggesting there would be future cuts in order to keep the stock market going up.  If inflation had been under control they would have lowered rates sooner.  Then 1 month prior to the election they ""sent a strong signal""  by lowering the rate 50 bps.  They knew that would in the short term cause the stock market to spike.  They also knew that would cause inflation to rise but it would take longer for that data to show because inflation is a lagging indicator.  The 2 most recent inflation reports show that is exactly what happened which is why they are now reversing course and slowing the rate cuts.  We want to believe that agencies like the Fed are non-partisan.  I just don't believe they acted that way this year.; But they most certainly will be well positioned in 4 years if they just DCA. Unless the world ends.; 50 bps rate cut is not cautious.  25 bps would have been cautious.  People can disagree, but the 50bps cut in September (when the market was factoring in 25) seemed motivated more by politics then economic data.  He knew a large cut like that would spike the market leading into the election.  Now he is correcting back to what is probably actually the correct policy given the economic data.; That's your interpretation but there basically no proof. There was a bad job report at the same time and they were preparing to cut rate for a long time if you remember.; Depends if they blow all their buying power too quickly. Just look at people already ready to buy the dip. If they get rugged a few times it can make them long investors. 

Good luck finding support when it dumps with all the daytraders taking peoples money; Sometimes ""the world ends"" is exactly what you need. 3/20 was terrible, but not for me."

Not hard to understand that treasury yields would rally and stock market would fall; Its more the fact that the fed revised their expected rate cuts for 2025; I agree. This news should have pumped.; Yeah that's a nice Christmas present; Too many geniuses from subreddits like this make up the markets these days huh?  They think the FED is supposed to make their stonks go up.

This market has no idea what fun awaits for them over this next year.  I don't think the tariffs and field worker deportations have been priced in yet, along with levels of buffoonery never seen outside of fiction.; Guy jumped off house with dick out and landed right up my ass. 


I hate these crash landings. ; Tax harvesting at relative top, by quant and institutions to fund Christmas, into January rally probably. ; [deleted]; TSLA down 8.8% !; Where did the regards go wrong; Was before the crash. It was even green for some time; I bought spy calls at 3:59pm and down almost 5%; https://preview.redd.it/ug3i1t1v2p7e1.jpeg?width=1900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b39ef6d4b1368c04c4abae3feb9d1c1be78c26f2; Bought INTC at $19.26. Placed the order a week ago and just waited to see what would happen.; Googl; naw, Powell is going to be a prick until 2026 when he gets the boot; I will be messaging you in 10 months on [**2025-10-19 00:44:08 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2025-10-19%2000:44:08%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hhc6sp/hey_wife_look_what_i_did_today_at_work_jpow/m2qzcha/?context=3)

|-|-|-|-|; Oh my gourd! 


*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*; You guys are buying the tip. I was told to do something completely different. I’m never going to Wendy’s again; Is this the rich person equivalent of people rushing to buy a 500$ TV on 5% discount.; Atta boy.; Ran out of cash today, gotta get bent over to get more for tomorrow. Everyone have a safe night. ; I’m on margin, calls and stock with avg of 42. I didn’t sell one thing today; Nah, since 2022 Fed Officials can't buy single stocks, sector funds, crypto, commodities, derivatives (futures or options), shorts, or buy on margin. It's congress members that still get to have all that fun...; Surely someone will investigate that; If your getting fucked for millions what'd the problem. Bend over. ; Brother, I live in southwest Virginia, you're basically Bill Gates around here if you're making 250k a year; He would be the poorest person on r/salary; Not only that, but they did exactly as they *should* do and are signaling what they should be signaling.; Nah, just investments. So unrealized losses.; I did not.; SPY is going to be higher in a month, this dip will 100% get shrugged off like every other dip does.; Not taking about the macro picture dude, I'm talking about the way it rallied green before Fed on the news it was going to cut and then when they did cut, the markert took a fat shit on my stocks. It's really not that hard to conceptualize everyones anger, READ THE FUCKING ROOM; Have they rallied though?; nah, stock market will shrug off this news and rally into a new high in 2025; don't even act like you (yes you) understand what you wrote, you probably asked Chatgpt to write a reply to me. I've likely been in the market longer than you so dont even tryyyyy to tell me what I understand or not, EW. Stay in ur lane lil bro; Was priced in 2 on Monday at a minimum. ; Yes - I understand that. But he later went on to say he doesn't really know if he will cut or raise for next year but said ""depends on sentiment"" and then he literally took questions saying he's bullish on the next admin... and still the market wiped its ass on my face ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275); It is like an option on the market now. ; Such a ridiculous stock too, revenue is slowing hard and profit is stagnating, still up 100% lol; That's why they are all coming here; I bought Google Calls and it's down 18%. That's not a big deal for me, since the amount was very small (As I said, it was the first time I used options).; You will regret it when they hit $15.26 🤣. ; We’re all going to Wendy’s if this continues; I was wondering why there's a line at the Wendy's dumpster; Since 2022? You mean that year that just happened?; But his wife‘s boyfriend can. ; They don't get to stuff all their money into a trust that does all that form them?; damn. so congress people can fuck the country in the ass, escape all blame/accountability, invest in stocks that they know their policies will effect either negatively or badly, and avoid all responsibility? and the fed chair cant touch a single type of stock trade except buying SPY, only gets paid $250k a year, and receives ALL blame when the stock market crashes and the economy isn't doing well?

no wonder the dude is stressed af. seems like the worst job of all time; Won’t be Nancy; And people should have sold all those overvalued stocks. I mean come on. P/e of 50-100 seems like the new normal now. ; As long as I don't look at my phone, it's all unrealized.; alright shut the fuck up then pussy; This is why I don’t like long term investments. Random bottom drop out and lose half over night; So what's the issue?; He's not going to do the opposite just to placate you degenerate gamblers.

I know you guys always shit bricks over even a 1% move, since you regards are 100X leveraged and still get wiped out somehow.; Did you even listen to what JPOW said? What part of the statement made the cut sound dovish? Maybe learn to listen before you read the fucking room; Isn‘t this the whole point? To dump before everybody else does it?; 10 yr went from 4.39 to 4.52 in a couple hours which is a pretty big move yes; I agree tbh, just explaining the immediate short term impact after the Jpow commentary; Seethe and cope harder; Saying ""he doesn't know"" surely sounds promising.; Wiping face with ass sounds promising behind any Wendy's. ; Luckily I got a bunch of TSLA last summer, so I’m still riding the wacky wave, an 8% drop ain’t that bad.; Thank you for the price point. Ok with you to put that on my Bingo card?; Took your tip put it in dip. Thats how we got here. ; Oh hey can you pick me up a double cheese with fries and a frosty.; Yeah, due of course to some super sketchy looking trades that occurred just before the pandemic in 2020.; Yeah, I remember when the change was enacted in 2022, Powell at a press conference was like ""all voting members at the Fed unanimously support and voted for making these changes. The last thing we would want is to impede the trust of the American people."" 

Then probably a month or two later, Pelosi was asked by the press if congress should not be allowed to trade and she was like taken aback by the question or suggestion, like ""of course we should be allowed to trade whenever we want - this is America!"" Haha.; She'll investigate what he bought that she didn't to see if he made more than her.; everything has to go up, by any means nessesary…; I was glued online last night. I realized myself into a catatonic stupor; Huh how would you lose half on long term investments though. Something doesn’t add up🤔; I’m only down 3% today so not a big deal.; You're so right. That's why I only buy options.; Never used margin ever. Wrong person, direct your anger to someone else who does and honestly — all shit aside, whatever someone does with their money is (wait for it) their money. Yeah, I know, crazy idea. But you getting mad over what someone else does with their money is none of your business ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882) but hey let me not keep you from your hate-train, go carry on; My favorite part was when he said ""the fed can't legally buy Bitcoin"" 🫠; He said the US economy was good and they expect it to be good going forward. 


SPY -3%; I listened to the meeting live, eat my dick; Was a genuine question. Thx; suck me off and make me cum harder ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31224); for you, anyday, just ask; [deleted]; Down 3% bought more, merry Christmas to my brokrage. ; qqq went down 3.6%. if you lost much more than that, you were probably being regarded. ; So why are you telling us what you're doing with your money? No one cares about you and your losses when it's telegraphed like a punch in an 80's teen movie; You're mistaken, I don't care what you do with your money.

I'm saying the FED isn't going to placate you, or people like you.

Anything else?; Not yet, it can't 😀; Not while he’s in charge. Next year we’ll get the constitution rewritten.; No problem at all; Stop I can only get so erect; Us? Who the fuck are you; ya, actually I’ll have a cheeseburger plain and medium fries. Include the ketchup in the bag please. thaaanks; The sad bastards that have to listen to your angry pissing and moaning."

[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse); I've seen this shit many times and I am surprised every single time, guess I learned nothing!; I’ve been buying QQQ puts for weeks.  Burnt my ass left right and center.  Bought my first QQQ call yesterday.  Instantly tanks…..; wait they can go down?; You haven't seen anything. Just this past August, the market tanked twice this hard and the VIX jumped to Covid/great recession/dot-com-bubble levels because the Bank of Japan increased their interest rates by *.1%.*

The market is complete bullshit, completely detached from fundamentals and reality, and the weakest call of it's bluff will cause days like today. 

And you have to play it that way.; United Healthcare up almost 3% though... is taking the piss.  The only green on the heat map.  We've angered the rich folks.; Well at least it's Christmas colors?; Finally! My retirement contribution that buying today coincides with a drop in the market. Silver linings right?; Wanted to buy Nvidia GPU for Christmas, gonna get myself Intel Arc B580 now. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267); Nah this was absurd. Complete overreaction.; crazy how UNH is the only green fuq outta here lmao; Market will bounce hard tomorrow after everyone realizes they sold into a strong economy.

Today was a 🎁 if you took advantage; People thought there would be more rate cuts.

He said there would be fewer rate cuts.

Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.; at least my DELL PUTS will print hard tomorrow; Sorry guys that was me buying for $40k today.; Im not gonna let this recession happen; How many times must it be said:

**Stock market =/= Economy**; United Healthcare 🖕; i started buying stocks this summer and would like to know if this is normal and fun or some sort of extinction event; I have many times and like a true regard I ALWAYS get fucked. Turns out I’m a shitty hooker because I pay to get fucked.; This market is priced about 3x the strength of the economy. Correction overdue; This is a case of 2 things:

1) Sell the news. The entire market has been pumping in anticipation of the rate cuts and today was the final one for 2024. So sell the news.

2) Most companies that reported gave a poor 2025 outlook. MU today just the most recent example.; UNH is up lol; I sold because of the aliens; Hurr durr stonks go up; It's because everyone knows under Trump there are dozens of his policies that are going to create insane inflation and Destroy anyone making less than $75,000 a year; This is all joe Bidens fault! Somehow...; Buy shitty penny stocks to stay cheerful, there’s always one or two going mental in the opposite direction to everything else.; So the stock market get murdered by JPOW and guess who is the last man standing : United Health Group. Coincidence, I think not; Zoom out on your chart, 2001, 2008, 2020, they all look like minor blips in the macro. When everyone is selling, I’m buying.; https://preview.redd.it/8oe68gphgo7e1.jpeg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b213cbfd43ef03a19ec7c8427182cd291dcfdb5

All I know is if I see VIX like this on a not that bad of a news, I’m loading all the calls I can get.; https://preview.redd.it/cbwg6fhdfo7e1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c054b485d0a4d92f4527089e8731ab1efb6011f2

👀👀; it's just a holiday sale. relax; OH NOO.

WE DROPPED BACK TO LAST WEEK LEVELS

AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH; It’s going to rip green, this is a buying opportunity; look at Healthcare, thriving amongst all that death.  Where's Luigi when we need him?; How do I find where to get this website of stocks; That motherfucking UNH is up!!! Luigi probably going nuts in his cell; lol when they say the economy is going well it means money is moving around. It doesn’t mean it’s moving to you; This is what you call an opportunity; Ok upvote for the title; It’s a fucking 2% pullback in the midst of the wildest period of 200+% price growth in history. Chill tf out people.; People are just tax loss harvesting; Buy the rumor, sell the news.; If you think the US economy is unwell, what would you call the Canadian economy?😂; I bought 10 calls this week on Monday due to bullish sentiment. Dreading tomorrow AM. Thanks; Bought 15 calls of TSLA expiring in 2 days @5.50  
Am I cooked ?; CVS, is green because people are gonna be picking up their meds after the market closes.; I don’t mean to sound like a remtard, but what is that a screenshot of? Which site / program / visualiser is that? It is epic…, apart from the redness, obvs. Serious question. I want that on my screen, but the green version.; It is an opportunity. The longer I’m here I’m more comfortable I become.; First time?; Today was like a full page ad for covered calls. Holy fuck they made nightmare into merely very shitty today; What’s amazing, when everything is dying, including stock market, that when healthcare stocks are doing their best lol; Tech is still up for the month. This is just a small bump.; NBD dude.  Market do wut it do.  Plan for it and ride it out.; Young chap, you have a lot to learn.; Why do people think ""the economy"" = the stock market? You can have a healthy economy and an overpriced stock market at the same time. And you can have a healthy (growing) economy that at the same time offers no value to the working class.; well doesn't this look festive or what.; The stock market isn't the economy.... Until it is![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); chuckles in extremely volatile micro cap; Calls on UNH; The real bullshit is spy had no business hitting 600 in the first place. Still overbought af at these prices.; I brought 2 12/27 590 around 3:00 should have went all in would have 4x smh; Does no one here understand the relationship between interest rates and growth stocks? Apparently not…; Gann day iykyk; Exactly wtf? 0.25% was expected and was all over the news. Don't give me BS reason about the guidance, it was all well known. Market makers just having fun at this point.; [removed]; he meant deep well; Wow healthcare holds hmmmmmm; Harris Teeter replaced all their carry baskets from green with red last week. The managers foresaw the sell off coming.; UHC. LOL; It’s a crime that’s forsure maximum sentence is 0 days in jail; Last trading hour was a big jpow fiasco; Priced in a course; Those healthcare plans tho 👀; 3 weeks, lmao; [removed]; Ahh yes, healthcare is up because our monthly payments for the life saving heart surgery will be lower. Now they can squeeze the difference for the anal lube fee.; Sly the brouhaha, smell the brews.; haha welcome; All rich people heard is time to dump for the next chump pump; A whole 3 weeks damn. What a long career; follow shrill absorbed squeal seed impossible crush bow sparkle sleep; This is the time of year people cash in their profits, write off their losses and how they get a nice bonus, if you work for a company.; Uber…a safe haven apparently; There’s the economy and then there is the market. Two different things.; Bro got liquidated 💀; 3 weeks lol; Buy; It'll be green AF tomorrow; Market have been rally since early nov and today just aligned with Nov 8..; Very Christmassy. 

IN HELL!; Thanks Elon for shitting down the government ....; 🟢 Bitcoin; The beginning of the…….?; If this image were a song—> Face Down Ass Up by 2Live Crew; the irony lmao; Of course UNH is green, I had a feeling they bottomed. I was hoping we'd see 450.; That green splash though; Burning 🔥; Thank god for my UNH calls…; It’s funny because I actually invested in stocks for the first time 3 weeks ago 🙃; Stinks wemp up when they were hiking rates, now stonks will go down on every cut, ok, I got it.; Man, I should have bought puts. Man, I’ve thought of it. Man, why did I buy calls; Sorry, I bought some stock this morning so obviously the market crashed immediately afterwards.  My fault; Looks like webpack bundle size analyzer but with $$; Shit been rocketing up since before election; Wait for the election trading day gap fill that’ll be a buying opportunity; Last time I got puts nothing happened today It just dropped like the world on fire; ""In my 3 weeks of trading"" I'm dying.; Stocks were on sale.  I hope you animals bought some good ones.; What? How old are you?; United Healthcare the only thing green on that chart...; u havent seen shit; UNH closing green hurts even more; I heard him and the orange idiot got beef so it's basically a fuck you. Blew my accounts in one day is crazy work; Oh neat, indexes are on sale.; Looking like a lot of opportunities to me. Bullish.; RIP my calls. Lol.; Rug pull!; The economy is not the stock market and the stock market is not the economy. Irrational exuberance is what’s it is.; [removed]; was it an overreaction or? i missed it, picked up a shift at the wendys; America elected a liar in chief. JPOW came out and gave honesty when asked questions. He should know the market and America like to be lied to.; Market is highly overinflated. Let it come down back to reality, enough of this hype. Look at the P/E and more, fundamentals still matter.; I am here for the loss porn.; You're fine.; It’s almost as if the stock market is not indicative of the economy.; Trump is coming big money takes their profit before the shit hits the fan.; Stock markets trades on expectations of the future. People expected at least 5-6 rate cuts next year but they announced likely to be 2. Higher interest means ppl have less to spend.; This is called….artificial deflation….; Xmas sale!!!; Newsflash 🗞️ the market doesn't believe him.; Tell me about it! I've been trading for 3 days now, and I've never seen such bullshit before!!!; Only three weeks? Don't worry, more bullshit is yet to come.; That looks like a fractal of fucked portfolios.; Wall Street is not the sole definition of the economy; May I know what website is this? Where you can see all the stocks. Thanks!; Papa is Santa still coming?; MM expected gooder or the goodest of economies.; Rate cuts do not make for market confidence.; Cucks gone wild in here

This market was fucked up for years. What’s good for the economy is bad for the market.; “ I’ve never seen such bullshit in the last 15 years of printing money we don’t have at the expense of poor people” - the fed; These are rookie numbers. Nothing to make a fuss about; Can someone explain what happen; Friday is also the last big options expiration date of the year. This includes quarterlies that could have been bought pre election. I expect a shitshow the next 2 days; https://preview.redd.it/rclmpkp7hp7e1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3768925b4f0c6218c10d54a37203b904a1c4f2ea

Let me graze in the fields of green ![img](emote|t5_2th52|27421); This situation reminds me of  recent HOA meeting:

ACC chairman: With Bert leaving the ACC, I appointed Cedric to the committee.

Board President: You have no authority to appoint someone. The Board appoints ACC members. We would be glad to consider Cedric, but we are going to ask if others would also like to be on the committee. 

ACC Chairman: You don't like Cedric?

Board President: Cedric is a fine fellow, but you do not have authority to appoint anyone. Only the Board can do that, and we want to let any other interested to also be considered. 

ACC Chairman (interrupting): You don't like Cedric?; It's down because JPOW lowered the 4 expected rate cuts in 2025 to 2.; Market makers do what market makers do; How was it bs? Lol. The market was way above where it should be. We had a bit of a correction. The  U.S. economy is in shambles. We haven't had more than a 10%pb in a while. Today was only 3%. Honestly, there is no reason we aren't in a full-blown recession as many other countries have gone in lately. All you can do is say, market gonna market. Trade what they give, not what you want. As soon as momentum slows, get out, stay green, and wait for the next entry.; What goes up, must come down....

Glad I took some nice profits out in 2024....

Now wait for some lows to buy back into...

Riding the coaster my friends ....; 3 weeks … 😆 welcome to wall street. You got 10 more years to go; These days are for newbies; No it aint; Buy it is; Boeing not red? 😵‍💫; ME: What's the little green spot in the mi-

Ooohhh...; Lol at United Healthcare wearing bright green on red shirt day.; UNH call holders looking at us like “tf going on over there?”; Should the colors for these maps be adjusted? Like does a 3% drop warrant a bright alarming red? It reminds me of the bullshit weather maps on TV these days, where on summer days it looks as if the world is burning up.; Seems like a major overreaction. Might be back to these levels by EOY or Jan mid probably; S&P up over 29%.... everyone: Look at all the money I'm making. Market only goes up.  
S&P down less than 3%.... everyone: WTF IS GOING ON!!! OMG!! MY PORTFOLIO!!!; Uber calls; Fed rate cut = dump
Fed rate increase = pump
Earning beat = dump
Earning miss = pump; I’m so glad I sold my TSLA this morning before it tanked…..; I had some hedging puts and covered calls which saved me somewhat. Now it’s time to buy the dips. Now watch NVDA 🚀 and everything else will piddle around. 😂; Fucking pussies; Market wanted more than a 1/4, needed a 1/2.; Quantum computing still jerking; QUBT up 50%; *Opportunities (Let's Make Lots of Money)*; You’ll be ok. Just double up on your blood bank deposits?!; Also, really giant dick punch that equities and crypto are now a correlated relationship.  Oh, and bonds too. 


Almost like 12 people control 50%+ of all assets and when they get sad everyone gets it dry up the ass.; It's just our obligatory L's for the month. Nothing to see here.; Fairly typical rug pull, IMHO.; Kinda early for the so-much-winning rug pull; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640); I believe it’s an intentional cash grab collusion. Good news is coming so the plebs buy the news, initiate massive selloffs to incite panic selling for several days, then buy up all the cheap stonks.; Lol -- 3 weeks of trading; Guy has been trading for 3 weeks like he’s allowed to even have an opinion on the stock market 😂; Volume on Tesla dropped off in the first 15 minutes of trading, nvidia fell below support yesterday, markets are looking for the next big thing and it will be in the form of unmanned aircraft as AI data centers come online; most importantly UNH is UP; Meanwhile whoever bought 0dte 600 strike SPY puts before Powell spoke made an easy 15000% on their investment.

Lucky bastards.; 'Economy is doing well' means they might start doing QT again for a couple of months before another crisis makes them reverse and enrich the .001% again to keep the house of cards up. 1/2 of the stock market is basically fueled by QE liquidity.; So time to get back into TSLA again then, yeah?; Yeah except they got rid of one of the rate cuts and still did not stop the balance sheet run off and now we have a government shutdown on our hands; Tax loss; UNH is the one of the few that's up...; United healthcare is up? Hope Luigi had calls…; Economy is not stock market; Holy shit America is a riot, health care plans are the only thing in the green; After reading that people need a Christmas rally to break even despite being 23% up ytd tells me that half the sub is going to be wiped next year 🤣🤣; Apparently they didn't like Brian very much either; I’m a seasoned trader with over 2 months experience.    
I’ve seen this shit happen a lot, usually just before a big bull run, or a big bear sell off. Sometimes it’s just before a big flat period of not much happening.; Is that teeny tiny green box in technology for SOUN? One of very few tech stocks that did well today.; UNH had a streak of luck recently.; I cashed out last week and bought a smallish position on the market tanking by last Friday. Only 3 trading days off, I would have flipped $300 into several grand, RIP. Still I locked in 85% on the year, can't complain too much.

  
Now to chill for a couple of months and buy back in when the tanking truly starts.; Buy the dip; Congrats to UNH holders. Keeps denying those claims; Somehow the only thing up is UNH 😂; Lmao, tiny little pullback and the sky is falling.; Welp it was a good 3 weeks; What i tought the market was free money and never went down ? SMH Biden what did you do to me; Bunch of fucking whiners... One bad day and boo hoo... What about the last two fucking years where we've all gotten rich. 
Fucking baby's, buckle up and take a zanny.; Back to Reality ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); Does red mean good yet?; Love the concept that today was definitely some random guy's first time ever getting into stocks and he put so much money into it😂; He meant the US economy is *effectively* a deep, deep well.; The stock market is not the economy. You will learn this in you 4th week of trading.; Why would ""well - effectively"" be equivalent to ""great"". Obviously the market has greatness prices in, earnings is only 3% of S&P.; Lmao fucking UNH satan’s mistress; The dot plots are the reason.; Its probably Elon fucking with us all. He can pump it and sell it all without denting his wallet.; i haven't been paying much attention (broke AF) but i kept seeing SPY soaring and thinking ""damn, would be nice to grab a few puts soon""; All they did was talk about sticky inflation. If you bothered to listen puts was an easy play yesterday; Damn I thought these things happen every other hour; I too am a market maker🍆; Bullshit? The fed said they don’t want to cut rates as much next year as they might’ve … the market responded completely predictably to that new info?; You guys know they have to do this to get the Santa rally going right? Vix was too low and we had too many calls. Now retail will turn bearish and we melt up led by semis; JPow is a knave, not a knight; To be fair we hit all time high just needed some dweebs to hold the bill when the rich cashed out lol; Ooh look you have a square of green on yours!

No need to flex.; lone star $UNH; Okay. Thats not what he said. They cut the number of rate cuts next year back from 4 to 2, and he implied they may just do 1, and probably later than expected. Thats plenty enough of impact on leverage for growth and thatch PEs to drive this kind of action.; 3 weeks of trading!   A professional now 😀.     Market is now spoked about only two rate cuts.; If you’re an experienced trader you know the market dips this time of year, every year.; Good day to be buying today....  I picked up a few good deals:

AMD has potential.

Thx jpow; I'm assuming you were born in 2009; The market is not the economy; He also said ""We don't know what that Orange idiot will do but so far his ideas will bring back extreme Inflation and we are not excluding rate hikes"" 😂; Happens at the end of the year, every year, since the dawn of bull markets. How is all of WSB this surprised? I don't understand.; The market doesn‘t reflect economy… if it would, we would still be at 2021 levels; US economy is well, therefore no longer need for cuts = red; I sold my rivian stock about an hour before the s&p tanked and BOY I AM GLAD I DID THAT

Talk to me in 10 years; If I am reading the room right, there is one good thing in this chart to give everyone some xmas cheer - the only oasis of green is healthcare plans.; Confidence down; Fed announces a 25 point interest cut and whales start dumping........how does this make sense?? They said that less rate cuts will happen in 2025 but still why panic sell off good news......??; United healthcare seems to be doing good ,maybe a space in there capital open up; Reduced rate cuts in 2025 did this

Who saw that coming considering the US economy is doing well apparently?; US economy is not options / margin trading. Wake up fool; Care to see European markets so you can stop crying. U.S markets have done well so shut up and be grateful.; Hang around it gets worse then better. Then worse again.; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267); What is this, a green square for ants?; This was visible days away, just look at the bullish run, it was too steep. It all started with the ""trum*p trade""; JPOW sctewwed up many Christmas hopes. Fuck him; 3 WEEEKS!!! God damn dinosaur.; Market goes up for months and people celebrate… goes down for a day and everyone loses their minds.; Every time I think I’m one step ahead, the market makers are sixteen steps ahead. I can’t fucking win with this shit. I’m just at a total loss for words HOLY FUCKING SHIT; Its simple. 

We are taught and repeated it's already factored in. 

Its NEVER factored in. Ever. 

Too many people are chasing irrational returns at all levels for that to occur. 

Tsla a prime example. They have to replace MULTIPLE  entire industries to reach an equivalent value. 


MSTR is a god damn ponzi scheme based around pretend money that only has value because we as a people say, yeah that imaginary thing has value. It's now part of the actual index. 

All while AI bubble keeps building....but as of right now ZERO ROI to actual results. 

2025 is going to suck.; ""Just when I think I'm out, they pull me back in"" - Sil; Seriously, the market isn't allowed to dip?; Fr. I'm not mad at JPow. I'm mad at myself for not seeing it coming.; Can you please buy QQQ puts again. Thanks.; U bought calls after a giant green streak into FOMC interest rate day…. U belong behind Wendy’s; Same shit happened to me. I spent a month paper trading gold futures in preparation to day trade it. By the end of the month I was entirely too confident. I blasted my way on to thinkorswim  one morning in my undies, dick swinging... I set up a trade, executed and then threw my feet up on my desk, hands tucked behind my head. 

Within seconds the price dropped so fast it blew out my stop loss. My arms immediately sort of dove from the back of my head for the keyboard and mouse, twisting my body and pulling my feet off the desk. The chair somehow found new life in its wheel bearings and skedaddled the fuck out of their causing me to land square on my ass. 

So there I was a 26 year old man. In my undies, sitting on my butt, reaching up to my desk like a toddler to his parents. As I got up, I was locked into the price it had already dropped -$500.  By the time I got up, got the sell order in, and sold, I lost $800. I was devastated. That was the worst feeling ever. Mostly because my gf loaned me some of the money cause she saw me paper trading and was confident in me. Ugh. Just writing about it bums me out... Definitely learned from that lesson though.; Bought a weekly SPY put this Monday. Sold it today at 8:43am for a 50% loss. If I held it until the days end, I would have made 600% 👍🏻; So you’re the reason …; Maybe just buy and hold etfs?; Just a dip and thus buying opportunity!; As long regards keep buying the dip, there won't be any dip, it's a mere blackfriday sale.   
We have unlocked the secret of stocks, when it dumps, you pump, as long we keep pumping, we can keep the value of our stocks, well until we run out of money to pump, that's why we need interest to go 0 or negative, we will just borrow and keep pumping.; Japan has another decision coming so more unravelling of the arbitrage trade might bring additional headwind.; *This*

And this is why the market *is a Wendy’s*.

When your Company’s 401k guy comes for his annual visit, tell him that you’d rather gamble than max your contribution at irrational ATH’s.; This is why Warren B is sitting in cash and T Bills and chilling out as us guys load up on 0DTE options and bet it all; Valuations run on memes in 2024, and vibes in 2025. DOGE HAWK CAWK MICROPENILESTRATEGY Coin runs this bee-otch.; I remember this day, i was in market since 1 month ago 🤣; I mean that was more than three weeks ago so; its because United Health Care saved money on end-of-year CEO bonus; The market has determined that CEOs cost more than they’re worth.; noob here, where do I get to view this map please ?; Green for Luigi, oh wait.; Because it was already incredibly down.; So is uber and all the quantum meme stocks …; Glad that I own 15 shares of this bad boy 😎


Sad that I am still slightly in the red with it bcs I bought before the real dip :(; ITS ALWAYS CHRISTMAS COLORS. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|27421); That's the spirit!!!; My employer is getting bought and they're doing a dollar-for-dollar equity swap for employees. Tank everything for another month and then rebound because my half of the dollar-for-dollar is fixed and the buyer's is still floating ; Integrated graphics card for me...; another dip tomorrow I am going get a Raspberry Pi, lol.; Economy was great in 2024

We avoided recession

But we have 2 instead of 4 rate cuts which means we’ll never get rate cuts ever ever again so dump everything; SPY back where it was in Mid-Nov, this was nothing. It can fall a lot more if the market actually gets spooked; When the market trades like a meme stock, it can also drop like one. Even after today, QQQ is still up bigly for the month.; Paper hand cucks; Bounce back green by 1PM tomorrow; Market is down 3% and shiller PE is at its third highest value ever?


3% has never once in the history of the market been an over-reaction. 50% has been an over-reaction before. 


Losing 50% from these levels would make valuations *average*.


If we lost 70% from this level we'd still be looking at valuations more than double the 1982 minimum.; All I know is shit ain’t gonna get better with Mr Make it 2% or Ya Fired’s dumbass coming in.; It’s almost like it’s a bullseye on a target.; So is BCE lol; Yup.  

It's not Monday, so can't be a crash!  

Time to reload.; This is what I'm hoping on.  

  
Never had a >10K swing in one day before.  Especially in the wrong direction.; Well, i suggest you go against your instinct ![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787); yeah... strong economy...; Sure hope so.  I bought calls at close.; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640); This. Basically they're indicating uncertainty next year.; Then after that, change your last name to Burry.; Just put the fries in the bag bro; The world as you know it is over. Go get a generator and stock pile food cans.; I've been buying for two years. My port is mostly VTI/VOO so it mostly follows the market. This dip is not even remotely bad if you're buying and holding. People are upset on here because they yolo'd their life savings on 0dte calls.; It's normal.  Happens a few times a year.  It's buying the dip opportunities.

Most market crashes happen on a Monday.  Just check the day, and if not Monday, all good, buy the dip.; just look at the history of SPY and you will see there are a lot of periods of stagnation and drops; I started buying this summer too.  Right after I lump summed into VOO it went down quite a bit.  It has since recovered and I’m still up.  Once this bottoms out I’ll be investing again; A 3% dip is inconsequential. If you’re even slightly afraid run now. It’ll only get worse. ; Yeah I hate the word correction, but it fits today.; So dump mu TMR on open and take the losses or hold it till Friday?; Maybe 175; Thanks Obamabiden; Well. Even some Mr. T. stated not to replace a certain Mr. p. …; WeBull pre-market screeners for the win.

Coffee... load the screener, hover the cursor over the name, check the volume and chart thumbnail, swig some more coffee, and choose.  Like picking a race horse from the paper.  Worth a gamble.; I’m pretty new to this so forgive me, do you mean VIX calls or calls in general?; I swear the wealthy do this just to keep the paperhands poor so they have to keep going to work; No its not.

New ATHs incoming.; Finviz has a nice homepage that has it.   

Posted this exact same post here about three or four years ago, with almost the exact same title, and the most common reply, was people asking where to find the heat map.  Since then, most sites have the heat maps.  WeBull desktop app has a good one too, which is clickable.; Yep. Over the last four years,  whenever the daily red heat maps get posted.... is the reload signal.; Isn’t that when people sell at a loss though? Aren’t the markets up bigly this year?; Buying puts on Maple Syrup now I guess.; Considering you didn’t even provide your strike imma say yes; Finviz has a nice homepage that has it.

I think I saw a post about it... or wait, that was someone with their cat's paw in-between two Oreo cookies.  Must have confused the algos.

Isn't there some old thing that when Oreo has double stuffing, markets tank?; You know what I’ve noticed? Nobody panics when things go “according to plan.” Even if the plan is horrifying! If, tomorrow, I tell the press that, like, a gang banger will get shot, or a truckload of soldiers will be blown up, nobody panics, because it’s all “part of the plan”. But when I say that one little old mayor will die, well then everyone loses their minds. Introduce a little anarchy. Upset the established order, and everything becomes chaos.; Its going down but the scenario is the same as last December when it irrationally pumped hard; https://preview.redd.it/2mlplscj2t7e1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8c6b5a3c933a0f68c0d91e9c5a19d4330fa668af

They make $ on the spread while hedging to be delta neutral.; You’d still be up 24.5% on the year even after todays drop lol.; Stop gambling like the degenerate moron you are try to pretend to be intelligent and invest 😂😂; I mean what do you mean though - the markets ripped up for a long time with barely any corrections...; The stock market has been going up obnoxious amounts the last 4 months…; Literally everything has value because we as a people say it has value; Zero ROI on AI is crazy good luck though; only has value because we as a people say, yeah that imaginary thing has value.

You just described money.; >ponzi scheme based around pretend money that only has value because we as a people say, yeah that imaginary thing has value.

This is how all money works, a $5 bill is worth $5 because everyone agrees that piece of paper is worth $5.; Amen brother; AI can have ROI whenever it wants to.

The AI are still learning now, and already tons of people are using them right now (for free). Companies are even restructuring around AI by downsizing staff count.

Once AI is entrenched into business operations, all they have to do is kick in the subscription fee and companies would have little choice but to subscribe, because it's still cheaper than paying for more employees.; You’re smoking something good.  AI has zero value?  Why was UHC using it to $23b of profit ?   

It has tremendous amount of profit.  So many $150k/year white collar finance majors who will be out of a job in the next 2-3 years..  and that’s just one function..  add operations, IT automation, etc.  only folks safe are the trades..; !remindme 1 year; Let me know when you when you buy calls and I’ll buy a put for you.; you should write a book; https://preview.redd.it/r3jjt48kmr7e1.jpeg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3a9b0829283e8163ea5212e7f0c14c454646eee9; That’s tough!; Too smart for wsb; Now where’s the fun in that; What happens if has been dipping since sep30 and you buy every dip everyday. I mean I'm just constantly buying dips.


I'm just a dipshit at this  point. ; In the words of Tony Montana in Scarface ""I'm reloaded!""; Yeah, stocks are back to their level from about 2 weeks ago. It's practically the chance of a lifetime.; When’s that happening; My question is, is it really irrational or just inflation coming to the surface? M2 money supply has more than doubled over 10 years. Steady 5-10% levels. Inflation figures are pretending there‘s barely any inflation.      

Everyone assesses overpriced markets pointing at the Buffet indicator. But since this indicator was invented the money in circulation has quadrupled. Inflation rates do not seem to represent this as far as my limited amount of brain activity can detect. 

So while I agree with unstable markets, they aren‘t irrational ATHs if there‘s lots of hidden inflation. Which clearly there is. Now if I had more brain cells I could tell you if the quantity theory of money inflation is any more accurate than the figures we’re being told and what difference it would make if we used these  figures instead. I will research it tomorrow and share my findings. Just kidding I will yolo my life savings into Microstrategy as soon as I feel like it has dropped enough without doing any further research into anything at all because being financially irresponsible is trendy and I was told to not bet against market trends.; The cash isn't an investment, he parks it so he has it liquid in order to make acquisitions when the valuations are appropriate.; Thx for the good laugh homie XDD; C suite culling by investor hired hitmen is the sick new trick to maximize profits; I bet I'm not the only one belly laughing reading this.; They not only saved millions on the bonus but they saved millions more on the DOJ investigation for insider trading wherein the insider is now deceased 🫠; Take my award, you beautiful redditor.; Oh that was reaaaal dark; Imagine if he had a 50B pay package coming before something happened to him, stock would go nuts; Shhh the shareholders might actually start sending their own hitmen; Finviz. 

Though most places probably do em at this stage.; IM TRYING TO BE POSITIVE; Look at you all rich mf'ers.  Etch a sketch for me.; look at mr money bags over here with his fancy integrated graphics; 2-4 = -2 so math checks out!; We changed the definition of recession so that we no longer have them lmfao; to be a bear about this for a moment:

the US is the only economy not in a recession, and even then certain sectors of it (tech, manufacturing, white collar shit in general) are, we even changed the definition of what a recession *is* for the last 2 years, literally every single quarter of jobs data was faked upward/downwardly revised, the Fed has not hit their target on inflation at all and things continue to get more expensive, zero movement on housing, earnings are literally made up, companies like PLTR are trading at 300x forward revenue, AI startups and crypto scamming is back, ChatGPT is garbage and is already over the hump of being obviously worse than a over 100 IQ human, ceos are getting murked in the streets and everyone's cheering.; Funny thing is when we were projected to get 5 rate cuts in 2024 and we only got three, markets continued to rally all year long with no issue. Today was a total overreaction. Sure we might see some short term selling but you can book it, Q1 25, possibly around January or end of February they’ll be pumping this shit again for the next several months.; upvote because I want to believe; Or a continuation, 50/50; We also didn't have foreigners investing from afar, retail traders gambling from their toilet, and 401ks creating a constant lift.

Markets will be elevated as long as US is dominant. 2025 is vastly different from the 1980s.

Oh. Let's also forget to mention the rates back then vs now. And let's forget about the Fed and government propping up the market and bailing the market out if it starts falling too much.

Hate to say it, but it's different. I'd prefer cheaper prices but there's too much buying pressure in the modern era. We'll have another epic crash by the end of the decade where you can buy before it recovers. Be ready, kids, shit moves fast when you're flinging it around.; you know shit all. just like all of us. that's why we are here. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); Still baffles me that like 70 percent of his voters will cite a desire for lower prices as their reason, specifically oil/gasoline, when his plans will without a doubt make everything, ESPECIALLY oil, more expensive.; UNH is in my sights, for sure.  But remember, there's no silver bullet.; Funny shit, but most red days are actually Fridays, so... Fingers crossed ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31225); 30K here, one of my bigger losses.  Good time to pick up things on sale, but don't try to catch a falling knife, I learned that the hard way.; $20k today. Had to take a walk for a bit just to remind myself I’m not going insane; You must have not been trading during the last trump admin…; Agreed.

And specifically mentioning policy was unpredictable and specifically saying they can't buy BTC; And ""Under the Dome"" DVD seasons, just in case you hesitate with the last bullet.; I’m buying and holding!

It often causes a lot of strife in my life when I speak my mind.  Fine line between thinking the world should evolve around you and risking gullibility.; So many people don't get this. I've worked as a market maker and we never touched options.

You fukking with the best!” - JPOW, probably; In five hours; Don’t disagree, to an extent.

But, best case, the market has largely priced that all in by now. 2x since Covid. There is a lot of room to the downside for shaking out.

Draw a crayon line from 08 top to Pre-Covid top, to  2022 bottom and keep going…

That line doesn’t get to current levels intil **2030**; Don’t worry, the real comedy is yet to come; Rich CEOs hate this one simple trick…; They actually probably got paid millions via key man insurance; Hahahhhaha; I use pen and paper; Even when we had two quarters of negative growth this year, a technical recession, markets shrugged it off and continued to pump. 

They won’t let the indices crash significantly, *if* they can help it.; Chatgpt is good dude. I made a picture it drew of the market reacting to jpow's speech but reddit is being dumb and wont let me post it. But it was funny.; Seeing the reaction in here is bizarre. I’ve noticed the same as you and have watched stocks skyrocket in price to crazy valuations based on very little substantive metrics for months. 

This baby dip is nothing compared to what should happen. But I’ve learnt not to be a bear in fantasy bull land.; Stop. Reddit won’t believe the economy is shit until January 20th.; With everywhere reporting that the DJI is down badly for the first time since Carter was president, while the SPY had like 9 straight green days.  It was gonna come eventually.  

Reloading opportunities in abundance.; Only 4K, but that’s in my “Safe” growth portfolio which makes it all the worse; No problem with catching a falling knife, as long as you commit to continue to catch it; Yeah, I switched my view to ""all time returns""  to see some green and remid myself I'm actually up; We’d like it to be 99 but 95 we will accept; Exactly. It's actually so easy. Can't believe many people don't get this. Basic game-theory modeling would guarantee it.; Had a few background noise YT market streams going while JPOW was speaking, most were mainly people rejoicing with their strangles.  Opening bell tomorrow going to be wild.; I worked as a market maker and of course we made a market in options. That's what options market makers do. I worked on the open outcry floor of the Pacific Stock Exchange (which is now a gym). Where did you work?; Hedge funds essentially need to fuck retail traders for their liquidity right? I was just watching that leaked Jim Cramer video from ‘06 where he’s talking about it (I think the interview was supposed to be for some insiders club or some shit because he says in the beginning ‘this is the kind of stuff I wouldn’t say on tv’) so when they’re using retail for liquidity it got me thinkin (as I’m getting into options) about who they’re fucking and whatnot, it’s it essentially holders and sellers they’re using rather than options traders? Because it kind of seems like options trading is riding those waves the firms and hedges are creating; House always wins.; Market makers are bookies. They don't give a shit which team wins, as long as you make lots of bets; Market maker like same thing as flying man baby with heart arrow. Pair two people together to initiate transactions. Charge fee for transaction. These fees called ""spread"".; MMs are hedge to where price moves don't really hurt them. They make money by buying at bids and selling at ask prices. You can basically be a market maker yourself but there's actually regulations around it. I don't know the specifics. You would also need loads of cash to provide sufficient liquidity for the stock.; But it is because that's the value a lot of people have agreed upon. It doesn't matter if the store or value is something intangible such as binary flowing through cooper wires or green paper printed with symbols of long dead people. At the end it's the same thing, a bunch of people agree that XYZ thing has a certain value; Average redditor opinion is 2-5 years behind what's actually going on which is already 6-12 months behind what's being built; Yeah, that's me a couple of days ago buying avgo.


I also bought smci the damn day it dropped like a freaking rock!; Priced in; At the same time people have never been as financially literate as today. Supply and demand. If there‘s more money AND more players then the current valuations could be at a healthy level.   

The fact that VIX jumped pretty high and the markets went down so much based on very little pessimism seems to hint towards your assessment being more likely.    

However once Buffet puts his cash into the markets it won‘t matter that much how bearish the outlook is, supply and demand. So I feel like we‘re at the mercy of market makers, orange man, winnie poo and a KGB agent or so it would seem. There‘s no precedent so anyones guess is as good as mine.; That's because it's never about interest rates, it's about language control.  If you can give a Jpow-level speech with a straight face and some bigly words, the market might piss & moan (or even moon!) *but it will generally accept the absurd idea that there's a brilliant adult in charge somewhere*.  That there is at least the concept of a plan.    
  
What's a ""technical recession"" if someone says everything is fine and someone else is in the back making sand into machine gods?  Doesn't matter if it is all profitable, efficient, or even wise.  Only matters that the real possibility of profit *could* be there.

A market this large on a fragile and unstable Earth is inherently a sleight of hand. The truth behind the curtains is just this and nothing more:

*The speed on the money-printing crank varies.  According to the desperation we feel.  Whether or not any of you make money is entirely up to sheer, dumb luck.*  
  
*And if things get really bad?  We beg congress for the XL Kinkos Bailout Macro-Printer 5000. Then 10 years later the economy will be mostly recovered (usually).*; That was my problem.

Dow Jones Industrial Average's WORST streak in 46 years,"While US equities churn near all-time highs, one of the most closely watched indexes is mired in its longest losing streak since Jimmy Carter was president.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen nine straight days, the longest string of losses since 1978. The 30-stock index is down 3.5% over that stretch. 

The index has been dragged down primarily by UnitedHealth, the insurer whose shares have been in a tailspin since the Dec. 4 shooting of executive Brian Thompson.

|-|-|-|-|; You woke me for this?! That’s nothing but a fart. Zoom out: Where we are today was an all-time high a month ago. Even if SPY goes to $525 it’s only wiping out half of the gains for the year. Let me sleep…

Edit: initially quoted VOO price. Now using SPY; Its a shell game of moving building expectations and leaving people with bags.

Some of these valuations have no basis in reality if money is a real store of value. The P/E of most companies is insanely high.

We're just lucky we're in 'too big to fail' zones. Until it fails that is.; Right. So a majority of Americans contribute to retirement savings, but that’s just percentage of people who are contributing. Vast majority of the actual wealth is still held by the oligarchs; [removed]; Maybe I'm getting jaded, but this reads exactly like an AI generated comment; The call options these maniacs are buying on Tesla are blowing my mind. I just saw a post with 1600 call options with a  $800 strike expiring in early January bought for 160k. Eventually the hedge funds will clean these guys out.; Use logic here, my friend. If 70% of Americans are contributing to a 401k for retirement, and stocks decrease in value, what happens to the retirement savings of 70% of Americans?

Hint: they are in fact affected - I’ll let you figure out how; But that wasnt your original point. Now youre making a new, non related one. Good job. A vast majority of people actual wealth is held in the market. 70% of people who contribute have most of their $$ in their 401ks. Im sorry you dont contritube to such benefits.; And?

Yes, they dont have as much money invested. But that means the money they *do* have is more important to them.

If you have 100k or 200m, a 3% drop is still a 3% drop.; I’m not irritated at all by your comment, it’s just misguided and ill-informed. If as an individual, you don’t invest in the market, your future self is missing out. Even $50 a month will have a massive effect over 20-30 years. 

Plug in $50 a month to a compound interest calculator, with 7% (inflation adjusted) return for 25 years. That’s what investing in the S&P’s typical returns are modeled at. It’s worth it.; Beep boop; You'd think but I feel like 1) he's the shadow president and 2) its too big (of the stock market) to fail.; Yes, it impacts anyone with a retirement account. I totally agree with you, but the other poster isn’t entirely wrong in terms of who sees an outsize impact from market activity. The top 1% of shareholding Americans own 50% of the market. Expanded to the top 10%, they own over 90% of the market. The bottom 50% own less than 1%. 

Many Americans have access to 401ks and barely leverage that asset, unfortunately. But also, even if they fully take advantage of it to the tune of $23k a year, that’s still chump change compared to what a guy like Bill Ackman can do in a day.; Who cares? Majority of us won’t be able to retire anyways. I’ll probably have to pull my 401k to pay some bullshit medical debt because United Health will weasel its way out of paying for urgent care me or my family needs. All to help make our gracious, powerful, oligarchic overloads more wealthy.; Wow you’re so smart; People assume that concise and articulately worded comments might be AI. 🤷  in fairness, probably in a year, we won't be able to tell the difference. Maybe we're just two bots talking to each other?

Anyway, nice clarification on VTI.; Tesla is 2.5% of the S&P 500 and at this level and I’ll put on a small short to at least partially offset what I passively own in SPY. It should drop on Q4 earnings or when these regards stop rolling calls.; If the stock market goes down, rich people will have fewer vacation homes and the rest of us will have to work years longer. It’s an outsized impact on us, not them.; Nihilism is not a path to happiness; A professional victim in his natural habitat.; Thank you! :); ""haha you just called yourself smart. You guys are such losers. You guys take yourselves so seriously"" Why did you delete your reply? I thought we are the ones who take things so seriously?; Do LLMs understand/use emojis yet? Maybe that’ll be our ‘human’ signature  
🤖+😊=🥸; Natural habitat being the stockmarket subreddit lol; 🤖🚫💻🔓👽💥; You are literally talking about how the stock market is a bunch of predators. You’re less intelligent than I originally thought.; I mean, you’re still replying so feelings are mutual. Gonna see how long I can keep this going on for lol; Unfortunately for you I’ve not said anything that is incorrect or even my opinion. 

You are, quite literally, pre-oppressing yourself while stating the stock market is for rich people trying to fuck the middle and lower class while also maintaining that it’s a place for victims. I’m not sure you even know what your own stance is anymore.; So this was a lie."
How have you utilized algorithmic investing for your trades? ,"For some background, I’m probably the typical retail investor, but I tend to shy away from the “meme stocks” and have more of a buy and hold strategy. I tend to invest in what I know and what I’m comfortable with (SPY, Apple, Nvidia, QQQ, and some other ETF’s in industrials and retail). Over the past year I’m up 23%, but I’d like to be a savvier trader and see if I can maximize my gains further with shorter holding periods. 

I’m currently learning more about algorithmic investing and I want to understand and gain ideas from others experiences. Has anyone here been successful developing their own algorithmic trading models to initiate trades? Or do you prefer to use third party resources? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hh36fg/how_have_you_utilized_algorithmic_investing_for/,19,2024-12-18 15:49:52,"I too want to make a lot of money in a short period of time. Let me know when you find the stock trading version of the Anti-Life Equation.; You are not going to be making money with algorithmic trading as an individual (or at least, it would be extremely rare). You will be competing with huge quant firms and with the top of the top of mathematicians, software engineers, etc.

As an individual I will focus on following index and wait. If you want to invest in single stocks, I would go with Value investing or other alternatives in the mid-long term.; Only the WSB algorithm. Which is derived from ""line only goes up"" your results may vary.; Wall Street spent (IIRC) billions of dollars laying a fiber-optic cable from New York to London that did nothing except shave a grand total of five milliseconds off the time it took for information to travel across the Atlantic.

No retail investor can hope to compete with that kind of capital investment or the math wizards coming up with the behind-the-scenes equations making it all work.; OP found the Akashic Records which supposedly gives one the ultimate power of buying low and selling high!; I’m all about simplifying things with a solid plan. Algorithmic investing can definitely help you level up, but it’s crucial to understand the strategy behind it before jumping in. I stick with strategies that align with my goals—options, dividends, and the like—while keeping my risk in check. If you’re diving into algo trading, start small and make sure you really understand how those models are built and the data they use. Don’t let the tech overwhelm you.; It's probably better to wait for good opportunities to buy a stock than to build some algorithm up from 0. Algorithms also tend to overreact, giving retail investors some good opportunities. 

A lot about the stock market is about psychology after all.; Bit of a newbie...
What defines algorithm trading? 
And where does one learn? 

I had been a buy and hold on dividend stocks, on non-divedend stocks -  take a profit on half the shares if it moves over 40% and maybe acquire more.

Now I've started covered calls instead of just selling for profit - get a premium and maybe profit,  or premium and keep it...

Debating selling puts on stuff I hold at even ir loss IF I think it's coming back (INTC & DOW maybe? ); I am a simple man.

I do 50/50 VTSAX/VGT; In the past I have worked as an algo trading developer in a hedge fund and now I have developed my own models for forex trading. I prefer interactive trading for stock market.

BTW: I'm not making millions out of it. You need to already have millions in order to make millions ;); Isn't this the one area of trading/investing that individuals are least able to compete in? Tons of huge companies spend million on getting the most data, training the largest models, running it the fastest, and placing the trades earlier than anyone else.

If I had to guess there are more opportunities to be found in super long term investing since fewer people seem to be optimizing it, rather than in super short term trades.; I haven't and will never. Stupid. ; Op is getting 23% returns and wants more? LOL; Not to mention huge amounts of compute to train their proprietary models. 

You can use their algorithms to work in your favor though. More algorithms, means more volatility,  means more violent dips and overreactions. More retail investors, means more algorithmic sentiment contagion, means even larger unjustified dips. 

Even in this hyper-bull market their are a good amount of stocks with strong fundamentals at a good price.; You could buy an algo ETF and then you'd make however much % that large quant firm makes; [deleted]; Same thing in Denmark by the way. One of the biggest investment firms paid to have a private cable running from them to the national stock exchange, just to get a few milliseconds faster data, just so they could outbid/outsell others by a fraction of a second.
Not surprised at all that this is (apparently) a common thing.; Even then, they're no better off; SPY is up like 28% y/y, so he'd have been better off indexing.; He is losing to the market and now wants to make an algorithm that will also lose to the market; But do you really need an algorithm for that? I mean, it does make data collection easier I guess, but as you said you still go through each one and analyzie the fundamentals.; “Find the bottom of good companies” like Apple and Tesla?

Am I missing something here?; Yep. Seems crazy to me that people want returns higher than SPY when cash in a HYSA gives you less than 5%.; LOLOLOL; [deleted]; [deleted]; Yeah fair, using algorithms as data collection/filtering tool sounds like a good base. I was thinking about creating something similar but more for news etc, to do some gambling on ""events"" (and their aftermath). Different strategy though.; This just sounds like you’re regurgitating quotes from warren buffett. “Find good companies”. 

Long term, Tesla is just a highly volatile stock, it’ll drop from this peak as it did in 2022. Survivor bias. I’ll bet you’ve lost just as much on stocks that didn’t pan out.; You could probably build an NLP model that could ""read"" the news of each companies in stock exchange, rank them based on the market sentiment, financial datas like P/E ratio, debt to equity, and whatnot. Long on the companies with the highest positive sentiment, and short with the highest negative sentiment; [deleted]; 3500 shares at todays share price is $1.7m.

Even with a 3:1 stock split, that’s less than $4m; [deleted]; You sound really odd tbh. Remember something someone commented on Reddit until you die? Wtf lol

There’s only been two stock splits but for your fiend to have bought at $200 it can only have been after the second stock split which was only 3:1.

For then to have got the first stock split which was 5:1 they would have had to purchase below $140 which was the top price when the first 5:1 split happened.

In simple terms, it’s physically impossible for you or your friend to have got in at $200 and been through both splits.

At best you’ve got all you’re numbers wrong and at worst you’re fabricating a story."
NVIDIA's Recent Decline and Opportunities for a New Rally,"NVIDIA fell nearly 4% today before narrowing the loss to 1.22%. Since hitting a record closing high of $148.88 in early November, the AI chip maker's stock has dropped over 10%.

So, what is causing NVIDIA's decline?

**1. Supply Chain Issues and Challenges**

NVIDIA faces multiple challenges in its supply chain, a significant factor in its stock decline.

First, according to the latest data, the order volume and schedules for the GB200 and GB300 have been adjusted. Particularly, the mass production and shipment of GB series products have been postponed until after the Lunar New Year in February, increasing market uncertainty. Additionally, the small-scale production plans for GB300 face tight deadlines, putting pressure on GB200's mass production.

https://preview.redd.it/scpz7bjoak7e1.jpg?width=620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c84a2bd55783d7b6efd0bfff35d9d3c4a3db74bb

Specific supply chain issues include CoWoS-L packaging technology, heating problems, copper cable connections, and leakage issues. These not only affect product yield rates but also increase system integration time costs. Consequently, NVIDIA has suggested customers purchase the B200 8-card HGX as a transitional solution, and clients like Microsoft are considering switching their orders. These supply chain issues affect NVIDIA's product delivery capabilities and reduce market expectations for its future performance.

**2. Market Competition and Narrative Changes**

ASICs are gaining market recognition as a competitive narrative.

ASICs are chips designed for specific tasks, akin to custom running shoes for a race. For certain tasks, ASICs outperform NVIDIA's GPUs (widely used for computing tasks) and are potentially cheaper.

OpenAI co-founder Ilya and industry leaders like Microsoft's CEO Satya have started discussing the importance of not only training AI models but also ensuring they can quickly and accurately make decisions in real applications. This shift in perspective gives ASICs an advantage in some scenarios, as they are designed for rapid, precise execution of tasks.

This raises questions about the cost of NVIDIA's GPUs. While powerful, they are expensive and require significant electricity and cooling. As ASICs perform better at lower costs for some tasks, there's consideration of replacing NVIDIA's GPUs with ASICs.

Additionally, changes in scaling law narratives and the strengthening of inference narratives pose threats to NVIDIA.

Scaling laws suggest that increasing AI model size (e.g., more neurons or layers) typically improves performance, but these gains are not infinite and require significant computational resources. This means NVIDIA must continually invest resources to improve product performance, potentially increasing costs.

https://preview.redd.it/pjjpyc10bk7e1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=20d52e676ae3473e567bb43fb383864886de72cb

Moreover, companies like BTC, Tesla, and Google are investing heavily in their own AI chips or solutions. This intensifies market competition and challenges NVIDIA's leadership.

**3. Market Sentiment and Capital Flows**

Market sentiment and capital flow significantly impact NVIDIA's stock price. As the year ends, retail investors, ETFs, and institutions adjust their portfolios. Fluctuations in tech giants like Microsoft, Apple, and Google affect tech stocks like NVIDIA. Investors are more cautious, favoring stable, promising companies.

Given these conditions, NVIDIA faces pressure on its stock price due to supply chain issues and competition. Lowered expectations for NVIDIA's future performance lead to capital outflows and stock price declines.

  
**4. Future Outlook and Catalysts**

Despite current challenges, NVIDIA has opportunities for a turnaround.

First, NVIDIA needs to resolve supply chain issues, improve product yield, and delivery capabilities. Second, strengthening its presence in software and applications is crucial to addressing market competition. Additionally, NVIDIA should explore new computing narratives to expand its computing potential.

 **5. Technical Analysis and Price Divergence**

Previously, prices rose continuously, but volume and KDJ began to decline, showing divergence. Without capital support, upward momentum was insufficient, leading to a short-term adjustment and a break below the mid-term trend line, resulting in a mid-term adjustment.

https://preview.redd.it/ok73jyoabk7e1.png?width=4274&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cdb19d0e917d566e957a8693d65590b1adecf12

When Might a New Rally Occur?

From a technical analysis perspective: After two prior mid-term adjustments, breaking the downward trend line may signal the start of a new rally. Thus, this new rally must first break the resistance line.

https://preview.redd.it/2kg8hm6dbk7e1.png?width=4276&format=png&auto=webp&s=5917df78a1bf3692f719dc35622f9ad823fab4ba

  
From a catalyst perspective: While January's CES and the earnings release in late February may not bring major surprises, March's GTC is worth anticipating. NVIDIA needs to showcase new technologies and products at this event to restore market confidence. If NVIDIA can introduce groundbreaking innovations, a stock rebound is possible.

History Will Repeat Itself: A Bear Scenario that Will Likely Happen ,"This is long so if you don’t want to or simply can’t read, just type a stock WSB response like “hurr durr stonks only go up” and move on.  If you have actual thoughts on what I’m saying or think I’m wrong, please share.  

To begin, we need to talk about what happened in 2018.  The market and Trump’s first administration were running smoothly.  Stonks only went up.  Then in 2018, they didn’t.  Why?  A few factors.  First, Trump introduced tariffs on aluminum, steel, and other goods to try to make American companies a more viable alternative to China(sound familiar?).   This essentially created a trade war with China, and led to China showing much slower economic growth than expected.  This led to a 500 point drop in the Dow on global recession fears.  

Later in the year, a newly appointed(by Trump) chairman of the Fed, Jerome Powell, had a conference in December.  By that point, the Fed had already hiked interest rates 4 times that year.  Powell stated at that conference that the Fed would likely slow rate hikes in 2019, but the market did not buy that and fears of a recession set in.  The Dow dropped 350 points soon after.  Trump made remarks about firing Powell after this debacle, but backed off.  There were other factors at play, such as the Schiller PE being 33.31(it is currently at 38.55), but those two factors were likely the biggest.  

One more important point:  Trump is obsessed with the stock market.  My favorite story on this topic comes from the Covid era.  On Friday, March 13,  Trump brought the CEO’s from a bunch of big players to the White House for a press conference.  He basically paraded them around, lauding how everything is going to be ok and Tim Apple is going to save us.  During this Friday afternoon circus, SPY ripped from 250 to 270 in an hour.  That night, Trump sent a signed copy of the chart from that day to Lou Dobbs to brag.   Then on the following Monday, we had another circuit breaker day as SPY tanked 11%.  

I tell you all this because history is going to repeat itself.  Trump has already touted 100% tariffs on fucking everything.  Whether he follows through with them, who knows.  He could just be using them as a threat to get leverage on trade deals.  But he has a precedent of using them, so I believe he will follow through.  His goal is to bring manufacturing back to the US, which is all well and good.  Jobs are good.  But one thing about manufacturing here as opposed to, say, India, is we aren’t going to be ok with being paid $1.38 a day.  The cost in labor to produce here is not nearly as appealing as producing in Vietnam, Bangladesh, or any other country that uses what is essentially slave labor with zero worker protections and zero environmental regulations.  Additionally, it will take years for any company that does choose to manufacture here to get up and running, and who knows what the political environment will look like once Trump is gone.  

We are also set up for another war between Trump and Powell.  This one WILL 100% happen.  Although it came in as expected, the last CPI showed inflation increasing slightly after months of continuous decline.  The PPI, however, came in hotter than expected.  This is a huge problem.  The Fed will for sure cut tomorrow, and Powell will give his speech on using his tools and data and taking in information as it comes, but I promise you this cut is concerning for him.  They want that 2% target, and Trump’s hot economy is not going to let them get there.  The combination of Trump cutting every regulation and allowing companies to shit in our water supply, along with his 100% tariffs on some imports, WILL BRING INFLATION BACK.  If companies have to pay more to import the goods that they sell, they will pass those costs onto the consumer.  There is no other way about it.  I know his goal is to bring manufacturing back, but that will take a lot of time.  And in the meantime, equities will suffer as inflation rises, and the Fed is forced to embarrassingly increase rates again.  

What I’m interested to see is how the battle of Trump vs Powell plays out.  There have already been a few articles regarding Trump possibly firing Powell, to which he responded “I don’t think so”, but he’s a liar so I don’t believe that.  Trump simply wants to be surrounded by yes men.  That is why he had the highest turnover of any administration in US history.  Honestly I think it just gets his dick hard to fire people, especially given “you’re fired” was his trademark phrase from that stupid tv show.  Powell has said it is illegal for Trump to do so, and that he is not leaving under any circumstances.  Personally I think he hates Trump, and rightfully so.  

So this is my prediction.  Trump gets into office, and on day one announces regulation cuts and tariffs.  He gives tax breaks to companies that choose to bring jobs to the US, and so on.  He wants economic growth at any cost.  Markets react mixed because the tariffs are concerning.  We start to see inflation rise due to importing costs rising.  Then Powell and the Fed fight over raising rates to tame inflation, because higher rates = slower growth.  Where we go from there, I’m not sure.  If Trump does try to fire Powell and succeeds,  I think that will be an extremely concerning look.  Powell has done a fairly decent job of getting things under control, and has done a very good job of telegraphing the Fed’s next moves.  The market hates uncertainty, and he knows that.  Trump firing him and installing a yes man will be extremely detrimental imo.  

So what do you think?  Will history repeat itself? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hgqaex/history_will_repeat_itself_a_bear_scenario_that/,1308,2024-12-18 02:21:47,"

That would mean I would benefit greatly by buying cheap and that never happens ; hurr durr stonks only go up; https://preview.redd.it/ef4gojfh4j7e1.jpeg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=248519e9f7aac15596eb646f540641240c621d80; All time highs confirmed; Too long to read, bullish?; Bears after Jan 20:

And I think a lot of people forget about Covid starting under his term, finishing under the current administration. And I think Covid masked the economic recession that we were already headed into. So I have been trying to decide what I want to do with some of my stocks because I feel we are headed for a spiraling decline.; Elon musk himself said that the economy was in for some pain once the new administration takes over. They are preparing for the economy to crash so the rich can swoop in and buy all the assets up.    If the guys on top are showing their gameplan in public, it's probably best to listen.; I agree with you. Everyone knows the market is frothy but the dip needs a catalyst. I think that catalyst will be the fed reacting to a resurgence of inflation for the reasons you state. Can't see it being every gay bears 80% dip dream though.; This is the buy signal I was waiting for. 🙏 internet stranger; # Conclusion:

You predict history will repeat: tariffs → inflation → Fed hikes → Trump vs. Powell drama → market volatility. The long-term effects of Trump’s policies will depend on how quickly domestic manufacturing picks up and how well the Fed manages inflation without crushing growth.

Your take: If Trump succeeds in firing Powell, it could spell trouble for market stability.; There’s a few valid points in here, but hurr durr stonks only go up.; https://preview.redd.it/jmfhf0d9zi7e1.jpeg?width=562&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a01cd65bf97665d2d919229898dccc196addf309

Time to bring this back out; Retaliatory tariffs are going to hurt like a kick in the dick. Because the US is an importer of everything, Canada’s proposed tariffs on exports, if copied by other countries like Mexico… have fun blowing your paycheck on tomatoes and lettuce at the grocery store and gas station.; OP, what exactly is your position? Are you shorting SPY or did you load up on puts expiring Feb?; You forgot about the impact that the mass deportations will have on the economy, but in general yeah I think you are on to something. In regards to the deportations, just watch GEO stock,  if that starts to sell off then the market thinks it was a bluff and will be a non-issue.; The last sentence I agree with - if Trump fires Powell (who - people forget that he himself nominated) then the markets will get rocky because he is unilaterally admired and accepted by both sides of the politely isle. He is perhaps one of the last high profile nonpartisan figures we can count on to complete his mission devoid of politics. I think his legacy will be remembered fondly and he’s done a great job.; I agree with this. Too many average people think that the stock market is only going to go up after the inauguration. That on its own is my signal to get more conservative on top of other concerns with tariffs and general mismanagement from the WH over the next 4yrs.; Ok but when ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258); good commentary from original poster. WSJ editorial implored j pow not to cut rates tomorrow for a number of reasons, including maintaining the fed fomc independence...; I feel like markets are underpricing in a global recession risk for 2025... UK had a surprising contraction and Germany's economy and political situation are in the toliet. Plus the added stimulus China is pumping into the economy might be too little too late sort of deal.; Inflation goes up, stocks go up 📈; This was a hell of a DD. I agree with you on pretty much your whole assessment. I could see everything you mentioned coming to pass. It’s a shame that the majority of Americans either don’t or choose not to see the reality of what’s coming. Thank you for your opinion and contribution.; Can you narrate this to me?  I can't read; After OP posts all that, I think it's now 100% priced-in. SPY to 700$ tomorrow! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787); TL:DR 🌈 🐻 post!; I think you’re broadly correct, but trump is also owned by billionaires who don’t want their stock to go down. So even though the ‘actual’ economy will likely get significantly worse, i would expect the oligarchic overlords to somehow keep stock prices high… unless they start suddenly dumping stocks.

It’s really hard to say because the stock market isn’t a very good indicator of the economy anymore, but rather something that follows what people think/feel- as an example, macys has relatively stronger fundamentals than etsy….. but is perpetually lower priced due to opinions and how people think etsy as a market place will do better for whatever reason.; Is it me, or is everyone and their uncle trying to get you to short.; What is your response to an argument that Trump's prioritization of market growth would moderate his more extreme impulses with regards to tariffs and the extreme case of firing Powell; The Fed wants inflation at 2%. It's currently running at 2.75%. Median forecast for core inflation in the coming year: is 2.5%.

Forecasts for CPI effects of one possible tariff scenario (60% for imports from China, 20% for everywhere else): additional 0.5 to 1.5% on to of current numbers (i.e. CPI of 3% to 4.0%).

The Fed will raise interest rates again given the climbing inflation rate, which will again drive down stonks. 

Trump V2 will be no better than Trump V1.

[https://www.kentclarkcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/RESULTS-2024-12-13-Survey-15.pdf](https://www.kentclarkcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/RESULTS-2024-12-13-Survey-15.pdf); There are two reasons, imo, why Trump keeps talking about tariffs:


1. He intends to use tariffs, but likely in a more limited setting and not anything crazy like 100%.

2. He keeps talking about it now so the stock market will keep going down now, instead of going down after he presumes office. Market is kinda slowing down right now pricing in crazy tariffs and his simple calculation is that when he announces tariffs and the markets see that it's not as crazy as he talks now, market will go up. 


He really cares about the stock market going up during his term so he's doing his best to tank it right now and put it all on Biden lol.; blah blah blah, SPY 700, Eat shit; It's not about bringing back manufacturing to the USA. It's about raising money to be able to justify( massive tax cuts to the wealthy (and corporations) again. That's also the purpose of DOGE.; Look, everyone knows what you say is likely true. But no one gives a shit. If anyone gave a shit about logic, we wouldn’t be here in this situation right now in the first place. 

Buckle up - if you haven’t lost your sanity yet, you will. The mod can remain irrational longer than you can remain sane; Tldr buy the dip easy; Never forget- Trump had a board game called ""I'm back and You're Fired""; Let me get some extra honey mustard; Money printer go brrrrr if the market collapse happens. Money printer go brrrrr if the market keeps going up it’s a win win. It’s a mental game and I’m happy to get a good buy in on some stocks bears still lose.

Calls on money printer; ""Powell has done a fairly decent job at getting things under control""


Let's inflation run rampant for multiple years saying that it's transitory, before timidly reacting ; You have a generous review Powell’s performance. The Fed said they weren’t even thinking about thinking about raising rates which induce the banks to take on duration risk. Then he tried to bullshit us about transitory inflation for how long? Then when he had to take the Punchbowl away, all the banks were upside down on duration. He damn near caused the a banking crisis.  But to be fair, the inflation was fiscally driven not monetary. He was just trying to throw water on the fire that the Congress and president had  lit.   

I hope I am right in saying that the tariffs are mostly posturing. I’m sure there will be some tariffs, but I don’t think they are going to be extreme as Trump is advertising. Hell the threat of Canadian tariffs… Trudeau is about to resign.; I see stoopid bers are still not extinct here yet, more room to go![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267); Shiller PE is for Econ majors who haven’t looked at the market in their life; Well said; I remember when Trump was crying for negative rates too. He's clueless but somehow convinced people he's good for the economy; Bullish on this dumb bear; 5 months of up followed by the greatest reversal in modern times.; Man I hope you had puts and made money. You deserve it; Should have taken this post seriously lmao. Stocks are in free fall.; A lot of thoughts here and a lot of things have to happen.  I agree that tariffs are bad for the consumer. And I agree Trump is very short sighted. Not a good combo for growth and leadership.  If your scenario happens, it will be a stock pickers market.; Okay, hear me out: priced in; I agree this all sounds plausible!! I wrote a post asking if a hedge on the VXX is a good idea mid to Jan for a couple months as I think thing are going to go bonkers and not in a good way.

Your thesis backs my idea and almost certain I will do it; hurr durr stonks only go up; Note that Jerome Powell's current term as chair ends in May 2026, and he plans to serve his entire second term. Based on [section 10 of the Federal Reserve Act](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section10.htm) , he is likely only removable for cause.; Trump raises tariffs. Inflation rises. Powell raises interest rates. Trump fires Powell. Biggest market crash in history.  Capital flees North America for Asia and the EU.; Stonks only go up confirmed.; Stoniks only go up!; https://preview.redd.it/y3e660gi3j7e1.jpeg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ac4ca80525c0a20fb6c6fe7ed3f81fbf7cc86e41; Absolutely loving all these bearish posts lately I was starting to get worried the top was in.; Priced in; DJT’s first term actually went better than expected and probably shouldn’t have based on all of the really dumb BS that fell out of his uuuuuge pie-hole. And he hasn’t said much so far other than “tariffs” but I feel it’s just enough that this time, he’s going to do some real damage. 

Maybe the time to sell-off is before the inauguration and see what happens in that first 100 days of office. 

I have zero idea obviously but we’ll see as that time comes how the markets are reacting. Right now they are pretty frothy.; You got one thing right Powell is gonna be regarded and cut the rates again tomorrow then stonks are gonna rip![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276); Bro really calling bear since 2021….; I was also gay for like 5 seconds; Good read. Good points that I will keep in mind. But for now, stonks only go up ! Hurr durr !; It should be noted, that this time they came with a plan, not just to frolick around and see what happens. In their communication, deficit reduction was a prime theme, so I would guess they will make an attempt at austerity measures. Medicare and Medicaid will be gutted. I would guess inflation can be tamed this way, imploding standards of living will just decrease demand for everything. But the mother of all recessions will be triggered by the falling demand for everything.; You lost me when you started talking about pooping in water.; My guy, I’m not reading all of that.

Can you give us a TL;DR?; Thank you for writing this, so that I didn’t have to. I also think you were generous in not including the many other factors I see such as mass exporting of the work force, incompetent heads of critical departments, wasting time and money on retribution and so on. I will not be in the market when Trump takes office.; The problem with FED rising rates is it makes paying the interest on the debt even more difficult, if not impossible. Note that I'm not even talking about actually paying off at least a big chunk of that debt.

  
The way out of it is DOGE efficiency actually being succesful combined with massive economic growth, 4-5% for years on end without increasing government spending at the same time. That's not gonna happen. Don't forget that in two years there are midterm elections where Trump will likely lose his majority. Happens often to sitting presidents.

  
The flipside to this argument is that Biden didn't lower Trumps previous tarrifs either and in some cases doubled down on them and that this didnt stop the economy from growing reasonably bigly. Not for everyone, I know, but as a whole it did. Also, Chyna is asshoe. The US does not need to accept being buttfucked by Beijing.; That’s a lot to unpack and I agree with you, although I do not hate trump and see his goal. I absolutely agree with the fact that what he will do will cause a crash, to what degree who knows. Another thing that needs to be looked at is how many of these people on Wall Street and within our government hate trump. I think it’s going to be a culmination of his policies that hit us and everyone’s retaliation against him that will make it the blood bath that it will be. I think at the very least we will see a pretty gnarly dip and if there is a recovery the markets will be almost un-tradable volatility for poor bastards like me in the futures market.; There’s a lot of cash on the sidelines waiting for a correction.  In my mind, this kind of keeps a floor on how bad things could get.  Unless there is some black swan event, I think stocks could kind of move sideways with an upward trajectory over longer periods.; Trump does not have the authority to fire Powell.  Full stop.; I think we’ll have a correction similar to first quarter of 2022. Probably 4th qtr of 2025 through 1st qtr of 2026; Why would tariffs not be priced into the markets already?; Hurr durr stonks only go up; ChatGPT:

Here’s a concise summary of the post:

The user outlines parallels between market dynamics during Trump’s first administration and what might happen if he’s re-elected. They focus on three key points:

1. **Historical Context (2018 and COVID era):**
   * In 2018, tariffs initiated a trade war with China, contributing to market drops and fears of recession. Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s rate hikes added to the tension, prompting speculation Trump wanted to fire him.
   * During COVID, Trump’s market obsession was exemplified by orchestrating a brief rally, followed by further losses.
2. **Predictions for a Future Trump Administration:**
   * Tariffs and deregulation could fuel inflation as increased import costs pass to consumers.
   * Manufacturing shifts to the U.S. will take time and face challenges due to higher labor costs.
   * Trump and Powell are set for another clash, with potential Fed rate hikes to control inflation at odds with Trump’s growth-at-any-cost strategy.
3. **Potential Market Impact:**
   * Inflation may rise due to tariffs and deregulation.
   * Equities could suffer from higher rates and rising costs.
   * Trump firing Powell would create uncertainty and harm market stability.

The post concludes by questioning whether history will repeat itself, emphasizing the risks of Trump’s economic policies and conflicts with the Fed.; "" The combination of Trump cutting every regulation and allowing companies to shit in our water supply, along with his 100% tariffs on some imports, WILL BRING INFLATION BACK.""


Please explain how cutting regulations increases inflation? Cutting regulations decreases compliance cost which makes goods cheaper not more expensive to produce.; I’m not reading all that+you’re wrong+you’re 🌈; You didn’t mention energy costs. Big part of inflation.
Trump will be all in on energy production and bringing energy costs down. 

To be seen.; OP, have you sold out of all your positions?; TL:DR - stonks only go up. 

Everyone keeps moaning about Trump tariffs while they pretend Biden didn't keep Trump's original ones in place and then fucking add to them.

Biden had tariffs too you fucking clowns. No, not just ""targeted"" tariffs which is what you love to hide behind and justify his, calling those ""targeted"" but every other tariff under the sun from the other side are blanketed ones.

Yours are always different somehow. They actually aren't.

Trump has already spoken with the leaders of Canada and Mexico who each came out after the meetings saying they have no fears of trade wars. He fucking invited Xi to the inauguration for crying out loud.

We START to see a rise in inflation? Did you not just see the last inflation report with inflation already back on the rise without Trump even being in office yet? You're just going to blame every single rise on Trump from this point and again he's not even in fucking office yet.

Here's my prediction - Libs will always find a way to bend and twist any narrative they can into being one that is disparaging towards Trump regardless of how true or real it is. They'll spin every fantasy they can telling us how Trump is about to bring the end of the world, again, and crash our economy so bad we end up a third world nation.

But -- what will actually happen are some bumps in the road on our way to new all time highs under his admin. Then we'll get a new president and the same shit will happen. And another, and another, and another.; Something’s brewing in the market but you’re just a whiner. Stocks go up; probably, in fact I betting long that spy or tsla or even nvda gonna shit the bed big time due to the big T tomfoolery.

calls for the short term(next 3 weeks), puts on the long term(deep into the year); So, June puts on RUT and long QQQ?; Well said and I think you’re spot on. ; Forewarned is forearmed. Thanks for the post. It is good to be reminded of these considerations.; Yes we’ve all seen that triangle chart from Benner; legit amazing when he signed a copy of the daily SPY chart. legend.; Basically when he starts singing his tariff bills market will tank. Until then it’s gravy train baby; The market is going to tank because we are in an AI generated, Fed lowering rates to early, extremely high valuation market bubble. Warren Buffett was asked what he would buy and he said “Nothing!” The time you need to worry is when the Bears capitulate or there’s no Bears period like right now!

The world is changing quickly and the money is following it.; I read the first line and totally agree with you.; [removed]; Hard to say though will the market go up another 20-30 percent before it happens? There will need to be something systemic maybe CRE,  not sure.

Calls it is; Inflation inflates asset values. Stonks are assets.; I agree it will happen, but when? You cite 2018, that’s two years into the last term. Do we crash in January? Or do we have a 20% correction after a 30% gain in 2025?; Not permitted under law. Powell’s good.

Billionaires paid to get him in office. They will use him to grow their companies astronomically. Bullish.; No TLDR? Go fuck yourselfemote:t5\_2th52:27421; Scott Bessent is a pro. Tariffs are a one time price level adjustment. 3% inflation is OK for Fed, helps inflate away debt. QT could stop. Rest of world is in an easing cycle, dollar can only be so strong before it becomes a vortex of liquidity. Back to TINA. 

So sure there could be a sharp sell off, but 6.5 trillion in money markets, even 1% buying the dip that line is going up and to the right 📈; So, buy more? Got it.; Pull back, yeah. Crash, lol.; Who the fuck double spaces their sentences this hard; Do billionaires and the 1% want the market to crash? There's your answer. If they don't it won't. If they all go short somehow then a crash is plausible.; If history repeats itself we’ll be buying puts after the government announces unlimited fiscal stimulus.; Employees are going to be footing the bill for the inflation too. Don’t expect incomes to rise to retain the current spending habits. Maybe a few will be able to do the same business with lower overhead, but not enough to offset the total losses.

For every Republican president in their second term, the markets rallied the first 2 years only to cause huge crashes and recessions for the last 2 years. In Trump's case, he may only get a year if the federal reserve cuts 3 times next year like I think 🤔 they will. This means the second year will be down and so will the third and fourth; You’re right, OP. Stonks probably will tank. The problem is it’s gonna be really hard to guess exactly when. Do you pull all your money from Tempe market now? Do you actively bet the market will tank with puts/ shorts? Do you just let it ride?; OP isn't wrong - idk how anyone doesn't see this is what's coming. In what timeframe does this all start to become more apparent is what I'm concerned with.; Anytime I see the gov’t wants to ban congress from stock trading the market goes down.; We literally just started cutting rates; My question is how are his voters gonna defend this chaos?; This is valuable but centered around speculations on politic/s and FED movements. While I am writing this, the AI moderator says this post might get banned…

So three keywords: Tariff, inflation and rates. Even the projections are perfectly accurate, to what degree the market will respond? This is the real question. It won’t be a doomsday scenario I wish.; I’m worried about the debt wall coming up where a shitload of bonds and loans need refinancing; Our collective memory is getting shorter and technology is making it easier to gamble. Not a great combo.; Apparently the Swiss are concerned about DEFLATION and their central bank just cut 50 bps and threatened to go below zero.

Pretty dumb to be a bear as some idiot day/short term trader, in which ~99% of you will lose trading like this over the long term.

Now how do I get that 🐻 and noose pic?; I'm guessing you're not a fan of the incoming prez lol; Imma say this.... The day for the bulls to wear diapers is approaching .....The market only go up until  ""Sike""..... Stay tune for next episode of market only go up

Plan on selling everything in the first week of January.  I think 2025 is going to suck big time.; Trump does not have the ability to fire Powell.; Does no one here, you know.... just use stop losses?; Nicely put; No idea and no one does. When I am telling my wife how well everything is looking, I have found that is the top, that’s about now come to think of it; I’m most worried about the financial deregulation; Inflation doesn’t affect nor bother the riches, it s an opportunity for them to invest in companies that would beat the tariffs then dump it after 4 years 

Rates do not really counter tariffs inflation, and here s why people think they impact currency (omg I want more interest for my money…) but the goal here is to massively suck out the neighbours dependency, then open borders in 4 years, devaluate, dump, repeat; I mean you’re probably right, but this is quite short term; Thanks for the paragraphs. Positions or ban; Is this why some of my holdings are hitting 52 weeks lows?; Mathematically it can’t keep these high returns over the next few years and decade without a correction. 

Best case scenario 2025 is a stagnant year (or provides a very modest return) and S&P500 stays at $6000. 

But don’t listen to me, I’m buying whether it goes up or down. DCA all the way lol; Hate to break it to you but China knows they can’t fuck with Trump so they give in to most of his demands tariffs become a non issue. China market will be the trade next year; You just wrote a novel based on your personal opinion, hunches and a politician living rent free in your head.; You just took the time to write All of that. And the ask what do we think🤦‍♂️; hey I can't read all that. So i had Chat-GPT sum it up. Sounds like ChatGPT thinks you're a gay bear.

  
""  
Alright, let's condense this into a snappy TL;DR with some extra sass:

**TL;DR:**

Meet OP, our resident WallStreetBets doomsayer, who’s convinced they’ve cracked the code on the next financial meltdown. Armed with a keyboard and a flair for drama, they’re here to warn us about the Trump-Powell showdown sequel that nobody asked for.

1. **2018 Flashback:** OP thinks they’re the only one who remembers Trump’s tariff tantrum and Powell’s rate hikes, like they’ve uncovered some secret stock market prophecy.
2. **Trump’s CEO Circus:** OP spins a tale of Trump’s COVID-era CEO parade, complete with a signed stock chart for Lou Dobbs, because why not add a touch of absurdity?
3. **Doomsday Prediction:** OP predicts tariffs will skyrocket inflation, and Powell will have to save the day by raising rates. It’s a classic “sky is falling” scenario, brought to you by someone who thinks they’re the next economic oracle.
4. **The Grand Finale:** OP warns that if Trump fires Powell, we’re all doomed. Apparently, only OP can see the impending chaos, and they’re hoping we’re all as panicked as they are.

**Conclusion:**

In short, OP’s got their popcorn ready for the financial apocalypse they’re sure is coming. Whether it’s a fever dream or a genuine prediction, they’re here for the drama.

signed- hurr durr stonks only go up; I think a correction and consolidation is definitely in order. We need to see much higher earnings for these multiples to even make any sense remotely. Any major movement on tariffs will definitely spook the market which will easily cause a 10-15% correction. On top of that if earnings come in weaker than expected the tariff news will cause a deeper downturn.; Go ahead and short the market. You won’t; I’m still trying to figure out where all these magical workers will come from to work in US factories. Especially after deporting all the migrants. I guess we must be banking on the Tesla bot to do it all.; Honestly, not too worried about next four years in terms of inflation. Sure, you’re probably right that it will go up, but what I am most worried about is the labor shortage that will be def be accelerated by 🥭. The next 6-12 months, or even 4 years, will be nothing compared to what is to come post 🥭. 

I know this is not /geopolitics but 🥭 and any other prez are simply agents of whatever American society wants. American society does not want their equities to tank, so it won’t happen. American society does not want people not having jobs, so it won’t happen. American society does not like black swan events, so it will turn to government to fix it as quickly as possible.; Not American, but I also thought about this recently. At least this time I am better prepared to make some money off of his administration.; I 100% agree with you. These are the factors that could derail the markets. People forget how it was the first time around with his 2AM tweets and his tendency to fire people on the spot that didn’t do his bidding (Comey, Sessions, Rex Tillerson) so many more got fired by tweet.

Then he will try to spin the narrative of the tariffs at every opportunity. Even if the stock market tanks and tanks he will say: “sleep J left this for us. Or thigs will get better. Or you’re not telling the full story, good American companies are thriving it’s the bad ones that are hit by the tariffs, FAKE NEWS”

Musk is as unhinged. I’m deeply worried what his agenda is. Make no mistakes if, he could wipe out the Mag6 and keep Tesla on top he would! He hates his competition personally.; Stonks up; Just look at my brokerage account and I'm not even a gay bear but I buy puts itm and get wrecked; Buy the dip guys. It’s only up from then on 🚀. We getting rich rahhhhh; No I Don’t think history will repeat itself. This is a different time period from last term. Trump easily won the election this time and instead of him trying to win over big tech CEO’s, now they are all kissing his ass. Trump is walking into a strong economy, low unemployment, record highs for the stock market and all other asset classes for that matter. Yes inflation is a bit sticky but has come down considerably and stabilized. 

With that being said, I don’t think he will want to rock the boat to much as not to derail this ongoing party. He has support of much of the corporate world and they all want to let the good times roll. I do think some policies will cause more market volatility and there will be some turbulence along the way but barring a black swan event, I see this bull market staying in tact. Policies will be implemented that promote economic growth which will improve earnings and help justify already elevated valuations. 

My prediction: bull market will continue through his term and then market will crash towards the end of his term and it will be the next man/woman’s job to “Make America Great Again”; hurr durr stonks only go up; Bullish. Let err rip!; TLDR stonks only go up hurrdurrr; We’re not even in the bull market yet; Yeah, but not today!; from 09 to 23 the only 1 negative spy year together with covid 22 anomaly, oh no anyway; In my recollection this isn’t totally correct. 2017 you had an enormous amount of speculation in stocks as well as inverse volatility products like XIV and people shorting VXX and UVXY. In early 2018 that trade blew up. Later in the year Powell made a policy error and said “we’re a long way from neutral” implying that the Fed was going to be hiking several times.

That was a policy error because he assumed the market was on board with it. He later reversed that policy but tax loss harvesting caused a major selloff at the end of the year.

In 2019 the market bounced back but this is when trump’s rhetoric on tariffs began to really heat up. So the market acted like it wanted to go up but due to random tweets the market was very volatile and kept in check. Finally around October of 2019 the market finally broke out. I remember pretty well Apple breaking out of a range first and lots of people calling it crazy. That culminated in a short lived speculative boom into the COVID crash. Who remembers luckin coffee? That was a speculative favorite of the day. Virgin galactic was another.

Anyway, Covid happened which both caused a crash but also began an era of insane liquidity and inflation. The inflation led to a fed policy change which resulted in the bear market in 2022. But then the Fed reversed again and the market seems to have been feeding off of that ever since. In retrospect in 23 you had lots of bearish expectations not just because of rates but also because many expected inflation to persist longer than it did. Once it became evident it was trending lower the market took flight.

Now don’t get me wrong, I’m more surprised than anyone how much the market has risen on seemingly very little fundamental news. I have been very bearish on AI for instance because it seems like a huge misallocation of capital. But I attribute the market’s rise to a couple of phenomenon.

First the general access to markets via free instant trading and 24/7 real time quotes.

Second, there has been a major shift in views on cash. People just seem to be very risk on and not interested in saving given that the Fed continues to imply rates will continue lower.

Third, regarding the speculative froth that’s taken off recently, I think the part few speculative bubbles we’ve had going back to 2017 have trained people to buy into story stocks.

I believe what’s happened recently where the market has taken off despite lackluster job and economic growth is mostly attributable to a huge wealth effect for consumers that I don’t hear too many talk about. You have loads of people whose homes have 2-3xd in value combined with their mortgage rates/payments not going up with inflation combined with rising retirement accounts. In other words people’s wealth has gone up dramatically which has caused a more reckless attitude towards risk and more willingness to spend money. A third factor is that the US has produced more oil in the past couple years than the next two nations combined. It’s unprecedented. So that’s a massive tailwind to disinflation as well as consumer sentiment. We are basically all in on doing whatever we can to pump sentiment.

Obviously this can’t last forever. And what makes the situation very dangerous in my opinion is that so much of what’s happening is simply based on attitudes. “I feel rich today so I’ll spend.” Well that can change quickly and if the stock market drops for an extended period suddenly people will want to save. Plus the Fed has no policy tools to fight a recession and we’re already at low rates and low oil prices.

I think the most bearish thing though in the near term (that’s foreseeable) is that the Fed is likely nearing the end of the road in how far it can move rates. Without any more catalysts and everyone all in I’m not sure where there is to go.; If I keep posting bear fanfic every week, eventually I’ll be right!; Joe Biden just added the most tariffs to China in September, no one talks about it.Trump says use tariffs to negotiate and only on good we already make here and everyone yaps; So puts on AVGO? I’m confused; “Essentially slave labor with zero worker protections and zero environmental regulations”

Now you’re starting to get it.; Remindme! 3 months; Hey there bud, what about cuts to government spending? How inflationary is that?; I think you’re right that things will be extremely choppy, with swings up and down based on weird comments and tweets and whatnot.  

For example, over the summer we Trump made a comment about Taiwan defending themselves (something to that effect), and we saw a quick pullback in semiconductor stocks.; Housing was the biggest inflation contributor. As long as he can get that down, inflation won't tick back up. Most of the USA inflation was caused by internal factors rather than external (imported goods). i.e. energy, housing, food at home; Let’s not kid ourselves. Inflation is coming back with Trump. If people think otherwise, they are naive. 

What markets end up doing? I don’t know. Why? Because inflation means higher asset prices but inflation is also destructive and as you pointed out, could violently correct, especially if investors want to leave the US.; Jokes on you! All of my stocks have already crashed!; Did ChatGPT write this?; Too many words no positions me don’t understand; What makes anyone think manufacturing will bounce back, except for some niche industries that 100% require manufacturing in-house? You have an example in Brazil. Brazil makes a bunch of stuff for their internal market and tariffs the shit out of mostly everything else. So buying tertiary goods like tech, for example, is fucking expensive. Prohibitively so for the average middle 

Dell, for example, assembles consumer laptops in Brazil. It's a mess, RMA requests require the laptop to return to the factory to be destroyed and remade, among other very unfriendly processes to both the environment and the customer. So now laptops are being made in Brazil, sold in Brazil, at import tariff prices anyway. All for what? For a circular economy resembling former communist countries, which would manufacture, report, dismantle, manufacture the same products again and again for the sake of artificial productivity.

Great, it keeps jobs and plants functioning, terrific. It's sad to see huge manufacturing plants abandoned I won't lie, I've seen a few and it's a feeling I can't describe, seeing a dead town. But once those plants were introduced and exposed to the global market, even if they were lucky to survive oligarchs dismantling them for pennies, they withered and died, because their product was inefficient and sucked.

This isn't a 1-1 to the American case because imo the internal market is just such a rabid hyper capitalistic monster that it's too big to fail completely. But as a firm believer of the invest in America, live in Europe mantra, it does worry me to see the global market going to shit for some straight up shitty economic practice.

What do you think will happen to the stock market when the average online casino market gambler degenerate doesn't have money lying around to go all in on $AMD?; IF 

A = IF Trump gets into the white House.
Today Biden is still the president.

B= IF Trump is a complete idiot

C= IF Biden continues to expand the wars he created.

Let's not assume or take for granted anything until after January 20 th.; Tariffs existed forever. Media just make a big thing about it when Trump is in power. Europe just slapped tariffs on chinese EV cars. It is also not Trump who started a trade war, China created a trade war from the very beginning, devaluating their currency and not having a free market themselves. I swear, left wing people are stupid as hell, totally fed with the MSNBC propaganda bs.
You have to fix the trade deficit if you want to fix the money supply issue. They are connected. And as long as china plays unfair, tariffs are the way to go. How else would you pay for all your imports without exporting other than printing money? But hey, keep believing all those idiots in the MSM. ; Can someone give me summary of this long as text plsssss; I'll just wait for the S&P 500 rugpull moment, when the last-batch-boomers want their yachts and sell EVERYTHING.; #I’m not reading all this shit; TLDR; Seems like a good time to buy, and I can't beleive I'm saying this.. Gold.; I'm more impressed that a Redditor was able to only mention Trumps name exactly 20 times in a post this long. I figured I would have seen it atleast 21 times.; That’s a lot of text that I didn’t read, but I’m sure it makes sense. Well done.; hurr durr Stonks only go up; With tariffs you will see a fissure in the market. Mega caps will survive w minor hiccups. Small biz will get hit hardest. 

Plus certain industries will crater! Tech will stay strong but textiles and corn will take a dive. Soybeans too since we export so damn much soybeans that if we inflict tariffs then others will retaliate.

Energy exports to Europe are a wildcard. Europe and especially Germany still hold a diplomatic candle for Russia. They refuse as a bloc to be truly energy independent. US exports we can jack up the price at our leisure for gainz. Europe may retaliate by allowing China in for electric cars in a tit for tat as US tariffs hit; 🐻🌈🐻🏳️‍🌈🐻🌈; History doesn’t repeat itself but it often rhymes.; so reccession was trumps fault?; Is the crash in the room with us now?; Remember, it needs to have a reason to dump but not when its going up; Sure yea maybe eventually but the question is when… that is why timing things is almost impossible; So buy leap spy puts and become billionaire; hurr durr stonks only go up; Powell should be in jail along with Trump.

But especially Powell. 

Can’t get rid of that evil lizard fast enough; Calls;  O; The crash likely begins in January. Market momentum is already slowing here but most are waiting until the new year to sell to defer capital gains taxes. The same thing happened in 2021. After two years of huge gains, market peaked jan 2nd and was down most of 2022, -27% by October. This time it'll likely be worse as valuations are even higher to start. I'm expecting a -40% and this time bottom not reached until late 2026. Then we can finally start the next bear market from an actual fairly valued point, historically speaking; This idea that the economy is going to tank while the boomers are still alive is hilarious.

Until the boomers are gone, this economy is perma bull. You really think the generation who has luckboxed everything is gonna get a bad break? Lol ya right. Their portfolios are going to 10x before the market crashes, then when they are all gone, thats when the hammer is going to swing.; The funny thing is that this is a intelligent on point analysis and you can't make that on a Bull case but yet here we are. 2025 will be interesting to say the least.; It all about the Russell, if that goes bear, it all goes bear; Interesting breakdown...Trump vs. Powell round two seems inevitable if tariffs and inflation spike. Markets could get rocky if the Fed feels pressured to overcorrect again.; Trump will give a liquidity pump to kick the can past his presidency; Already priced in bro; He won’t fire JPow - he’ll just name his successor a year early and then everyone will pay attention to him instead.; I like how you wrote all that but didnt mention war

Thats the only risk i see; Didn’t ask Liberal; You had such an opportunity to title this
""History Bears Repeating"". I'm so disappointed in you.; If he gets yesmen in the Fed we're going to see interest rates at .05% and the next administration is going to have to start printing $1M notes like we're fucking Zimbabwe.; It is called a business CYCLE. Businesses expand, businesses contract. Stocks go up when there is growth; stocks go down when there is no growth or decline. Warren Buffet has been rotating to cash in anticipation of snapping up bargains when the market goes down.; Trump can’t fire Powell… (per a recent interview where Powell replies “no” to that very question.)

So…there’s that. 🤷🏽‍♂️; That's why puts were invented.; Tldr op missed the boat; How do bears find motivation? Like for 15 years, they have been wrong; It’s true. It never happens.; Let us know when you buy - so we know the crash is here; You can buy cheap and it’ll still go down with that luck; Last several years since the great printer went brrr there's been to much cash out there to allow for a crash ; I am in the same boat as you! Waiting everyday for a drop to buy.

The fact that Covid actually masked an impending recession and slowdown is definitely a provocative idea. idk if anyone has actually studied it because, likely, it would be almost impossible to discern how differently the world would have been ex-pandemic. But I think that I had forgotten this was actually an idea being floated back in 2020. Crazy that it’s been 5 years already.; Retaliatory tariffs are 100% going to be targeted at US soy, corn, pork, beef, steel, and anything Elon has or will touch.; So what you’re saying is, dry powder?; > So I have been trying to decide what I want to do with some of my stocks because I feel we are headed for a spiraling decline.

I’m waiting till the inauguration to see how serious Trump is about these tariffs. Tariffs will increase inflation which will increase interest rates, which will increase returns on bonds. So if Trump is a total loose cannon on tariffs, I’ll likely be shifting much of my money to bonds, until (if) Trump becomes more level headed.; I agree also. Extra points for posting something insightful to these mouth breathers.; Bird flu (up to 40% fatality) is starting to spread through raw milk to humans, and RFK Jr wants to stop all vaccines and stop pasteurization. 

So, it's going to look like Covid was a common cold in terms of the effects on the economy and human life.; Thing is, if Powell is blocked to hike and inflation spikes, everything will need to get more expensive in USD value. Assets go up, cash loses value fast. So selling into cash might not be the best position to take even if you expect what OP is saying.; >And I think Covid masked the economic recession

  
I see what you did there. Well played.; It all makes sense if Covid actually comes from Fort Detrick rather than Wuhan.; I like that conspiracy theory. Maybe Ackman will call into CNBC crying again about hell coming.; Musk is a sociopath and can’t keep his mouth shut under most circumstances so
I would tend to agree

A rug pull will happen retail and some pension funds will get bagged for a bit; Agree and I’ve commented along the same lines EXCEPT that Trump will not be willing to endure the blowback the harsh measures Elon wants will cause. I think that’s where a rift happens between those guys. And where Trump probably pulls back from the harsher policies, because at heart he’s a populist and doesn’t give a damn about the debt etc.; No it won’t be a black swan or anything like that, but we should see some fear at least; One possible catalyst: the House will pass a massive tax cut and inflation will start increasing again. That will take months. They’re also going to have huge battles over the budget and there’s a good chance the govt shuts down in March. And then the debt ceiling is going to be a problem. The House is 217-216 for a while and they don’t want any D votes. 

The question is does the market rally another 30% before it hits a big 20% dump?; Depends on how leveraged things are. The full ramifications of how truly fucked the economic system was leading up to the 2007/2008 housing market crisis were not well understood for years.  I would like to think that people have wisened up to the insanity, but my gut feeling is that fraud is rampant in the markets right now just given how ridiculously frothy it is.  No idea where it is, how entranced it is, or what the fallout will be, but all it takes is one event pushing the wrong thing in the wrong way and the whole house falls.

Good call on geo as well; They definitely want to do the mass deportations.

Markets love stability.  The fact you're trying to guess if they're going to actually do the awful plans they talked about or not, is a very bad sign.

This disruptive chaos will be layered on to the fact that they always give tax cuts to the rich which *always* screws with the economy.; Yup. I’m getting flamed in some of these comments for saying he’s done a decent job. He did spend too long on the transitory train, but he can’t see the future and was going with the data he had at the time. Since then, he’s done a great job of telegraphing the feds moved to placate the market, and he’s gotten inflation back to a reasonable level without inducing a recession, which is pretty incredible. He could’ve Volker’d us when inflation was at 8%, but he chose to make incremental adjustments and let the markets stay healthy.; He can’t fire Powell, even if he wants to.  He will wait until Powell’s term is up in 2026 and then nominate someone else.; I’m on Europe. People in general don’t care about the markers or think it’s a casino. 

On the last weeks, fuelled by years of a rally and the perception that US stock is very solid. Literally from taxi drivers to coworkers, from the book store to the equivalent “best buy”. There’s always someone talking about how good the SP500 is as an investment.

History Will Repeat Itself: A Bear Scenario that Will Likely Happen 

This is long so if you don’t want to or simply can’t read, just type a stock WSB response like “hurr durr stonks only go up” and move on.  If you have actual thoughts on what I’m saying or think I’m wrong, please share.  

To begin, we need to talk about what happened in 2018.  The market and Trump’s first administration were running smoothly.  Stonks only went up.  Then in 2018, they didn’t.  Why?  A few factors.  First, Trump introduced tariffs on aluminum, steel, and other goods to try to make American companies a more viable alternative to China(sound familiar?).   This essentially created a trade war with China, and led to China showing much slower economic growth than expected.  This led to a 500 point drop in the Dow on global recession fears.  

Later in the year, a newly appointed(by Trump) chairman of the Fed, Jerome Powell, had a conference in December.  By that point, the Fed had already hiked interest rates 4 times that year.  Powell stated at that conference that the Fed would likely slow rate hikes in 2019, but the market did not buy that and fears of a recession set in.  The Dow dropped 350 points soon after.  Trump made remarks about firing Powell after this debacle, but backed off.  There were other factors at play, such as the Schiller PE being 33.31(it is currently at 38.55), but those two factors were likely the biggest.  

One more important point:  Trump is obsessed with the stock market.  My favorite story on this topic comes from the Covid era.  On Friday, March 13,  Trump brought the CEO’s from a bunch of big players to the White House for a press conference.  He basically paraded them around, lauding how everything is going to be ok and Tim Apple is going to save us.  During this Friday afternoon circus, SPY ripped from 250 to 270 in an hour.  That night, Trump sent a signed copy of the chart from that day to Lou Dobbs to brag.   Then on the following Monday, we had another circuit breaker day as SPY tanked 11%.  

I tell you all this because history is going to repeat itself.  Trump has already touted 100% tariffs on fucking everything.  Whether he follows through with them, who knows.  He could just be using them as a threat to get leverage on trade deals.  But he has a precedent of using them, so I believe he will follow through.  His goal is to bring manufacturing back to the US, which is all well and good.  Jobs are good.  But one thing about manufacturing here as opposed to, say, India, is we aren’t going to be ok with being paid $1.38 a day.  The cost in labor to produce here is not nearly as appealing as producing in Vietnam, Bangladesh, or any other country that uses what is essentially slave labor with zero worker protections and zero environmental regulations.  Additionally, it will take years for any company that does choose to manufacture here to get up and running, and who knows what the political environment will look like once Trump is gone.  

We are also set up for another war between Trump and Powell.  This one WILL 100% happen.  Although it came in as expected, the last CPI showed inflation increasing slightly after months of continuous decline.  The PPI, however, came in hotter than expected.  This is a huge problem.  The Fed will for sure cut tomorrow, and Powell will give his speech on using his tools and data and taking in information as it comes, but I promise you this cut is concerning for him.  They want that 2% target, and Trump’s hot economy is not going to let them get there.  The combination of Trump cutting every regulation and allowing companies to shit in our water supply, along with his 100% tariffs on some imports, WILL BRING INFLATION BACK.  If companies have to pay more to import the goods that they sell, they will pass those costs onto the consumer.  There is no other way about it.  I know his goal is to bring manufacturing back, but that will take a lot of time.  And in the meantime, equities will suffer as inflation rises, and the Fed is forced to embarrassingly increase rates again.  

What I’m interested to see is how the battle of Trump vs Powell plays out.  There have already been a few articles regarding Trump possibly firing Powell, to which he responded “I don’t think so”, but he’s a liar so I don’t believe that.  Trump simply wants to be surrounded by yes men.  That is why he had the highest turnover of any administration in US history.  Honestly I think it just gets his dick hard to fire people, especially given “you’re fired” was his trademark phrase from that stupid tv show.  Powell has said it is illegal for Trump to do so, and that he is not leaving under any circumstances.  Personally I think he hates Trump, and rightfully so.  

So this is my prediction.  Trump gets into office, and on day one announces regulation cuts and tariffs.  He gives tax breaks to companies that choose to bring jobs to the US, and so on.  He wants economic growth at any cost.  Markets react mixed because the tariffs are concerning.  We start to see inflation rise due to importing costs rising.  Then Powell and the Fed fight over raising rates to tame inflation, because higher rates = slower growth.  Where we go from there, I’m not sure.  If Trump does try to fire Powell and succeeds,  I think that will be an extremely concerning look.  Powell has done a fairly decent job of getting things under control, and has done a very good job of telegraphing the Fed’s next moves.  The market hates uncertainty, and he knows that.  Trump firing him and installing a yes man will be extremely detrimental imo.  

So what do you think?  Will history repeat itself?; You need to read the story where Ethyl the Aardvark goes Quantity Surveying

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlOV7K-xOU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYlOV7K-xOU); TLDR TRrump is a moron; Yeah nothing really makes sense anymore.

A narcissist always believes they are making the correct move.; 100% agree; Honestly that’s a good theory. I agree that he’s talking a big game with the tariffs, and I would chalk it up to talk if he hadn’t done it before. The fact that there is precedent and the fact that he wants growth growth growth means he’ll likely do it again.; > He keeps talking about it now so the stock market will keep going down now, instead of going down after he presumes office. Market is kinda slowing down right now pricing in crazy tariffs

SPY is up 6% in a month.; SPY 40k; That’s part of it, but he absolutely is trying to bring it back. He’s made multiple posts about removing environmental regulations and giving tax incentives to companies that build here; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189); This is the way; I’m not saying a collapse will happen. I’m saying I would wait and see what kind of moves 🥭 makes in January and February before taking any big positions; Blaming him for something he didn't do. He did fix it though which was pretty remarkable.; Yes let’s blame the chairman of the Fed for companies taking advantage of inflation headlines to massively increase prices under the guise of ‘cost pressures’ - aka greedflation; What is it that you wanted exactly? Really high interest rates sooner to force recession and mass layoffs? ; Exactly. He didn't do the average person any favors. Of course people loaded to the gills with assets are gonna have a tough time seeing how shitty he did, because they benefited greatly.

Same reason older Canadians praise Trudeau and younger Canadians hate him. The older people watched their houses 5x in value over a decade, and the younger ones simply got priced out.; Completely agree that he was wrong about inflation for a long time. But you can’t deny that he hasn’t done a good job of appeasing the market by telegraphing literally every move well in advance for the past year and a half or so, and being super careful with what he says in conferences.    I intially thought the tariffs could be posturing, but he has a history of using them aggressively, and I think he will continue that.; I don’t think he mismanaged inflation as much as it might appear, I think he just lied about what he was actually doing.  I suspect the central bank knew they were managing the US debt so some degree because they know elected officials don’t have the stomach to manage it, so the central bank used their anti debt tool, inflation.; I agree, which is why I didn’t spend much time talking about it; It's still [remarkably predictive](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/articles/2020/07/20/the-remarkable-accuracy-of-cape-as-a-predictor-of-returns-1) of returns on market indices on decadal time scales.

I'm looking forward to a market where the Momo chuds get crushed, and those of us who read financial reports benefit. It will be great.; Exactly! He threw an absolute tantrum about the hikes, and he’ll do the same; Absolutely could be; Haha I was all cash unfortunately. I had some shit to do this afternoon and couldn’t pay attention. Feels good to kinda be right tho; Agreed. I’d love to get some big names on sale; I might give it more time. Just keep an eye on what he does his first couple of weeks. If he actually implements huge tariffs, I’ll be switching to puts; Yup. He apparently can be relegated to just another governor without breaking the law tho. But Powell can sue if 🥭 tries to do anything. Will be interesting to watch no matter what. I just know that a sitting pres trying to remove a Fed chair that disagrees with him is not a good look; Eh I’m not yelling CRASH, all I’m saying is keep some cash on hand in case of a sale.; Agreed, he did a fairly good job his first term because he didn’t really make any drastic changes. The economy was rolling when he got into office and he eased some regulations and let it keep going.  I’m going to pay attention to what he does his first couple of weeks, because I know he’s going to try to do a lot right off the bat.  If he follows through on the tariff talk, I expect to see a sharp uptick in inflation in March/april; Great points! And definitely something I should have addressed. This is another avenue toward a reduction in value of equities.  Deficit reduction would be very beneficial long term, but I don’t think he has the balls to follow through. You can’t have bull market and austerity measures at the same time. And his obsession with the market might lead him to abandon those plans, and just try to ramp up the economy and kick the deficit can down the road like we’ve been doing for so long.; Maybe not, but I don't think we will have a functioning government to prevent him from doing it anyway. I'd love to give him the benefit of the doubt though.; I could see that. I just think if inflation shows it head right off the bat and t rump is doing everything he possibly can to get the economy running overdrive, there will be a clash immediately.  I don’t see Powell backing down; Because no one knows if he actually will implement them, and if he does, how much they will be, and what countries they will affect.; This is a good point, and I shouldn’t have included regulation cutting in that statement. My main concern is the tariffs, and the fact that he wants to supercharge an economy where inflation is ticking up and consumer debt is at an all time high of 18 trillion dollars.; Good point. That is a possibility.; Nope; just chillin and watching; Joe did keep most of the tariffs in place, and even added. Joe and 🥭 were both responsible for the drastic rise in inflation and in adding a massive amount to our national debt. But I’m not discussing Joe here.  My point is that after a year of consistently lower inflation, we have started to see it tick up again. And if he does implement what he has been saying he will regarding tariffs, then inflation will rise again. He can invite whoever he wants to his house, what matters is whether or not he follows through with his already made statements, and that remains to be seen; Agreed. Euphoria will come to an end when people realize you can’t have endless economic growth and low rates; Thanks🤝; I’m waiting until I see what he does his first week or 2 in office. If the tariffs were all talk and he just cuts regulations and encourages business here, then it’s probably smooth sailing for at least a little while.; I don’t think we crash. I just don’t think it’ll be healthy for a bull market; I posted a link to an article regarding that. 🥭 can relegate him to being just another governor, and can technically remove him, but Powell can sue. The Supreme Court would hear it, and Powell would almost certainly win. My point isn’t that he will be fired, my point is that the arguably 2 most powerful men in the world fighting is not good for a healthy bull market; Cool emoji; Where did I say crash? If anything, I think it’ll be a similar tantrum to 2018; Holy fucking shit I do not think we crash. Nowhere did I say that. But the market hates uncertainty. And a battle between the 2 most powerful men in the world creates uncertainty. That’s my point; We’ll see. The interesting thing is that the repubs are in full control, so there really isn’t a way to shift blame if shit doesn’t go right.; They’ll likely just kick the can.  But how long can we do that for?; Great points; Holy shit. It's Chad Dickens.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*; That’s why I included that paragraph about his obsession. It 100% is a huge priority for him.  He wanted the market to crash SO bad during the summer. Remember when the Yuan carry trade unwound and VIX spiked? He latched onto that and kept calling it the Ka mala crash.  But as someone else pointed out: he loves the markets, but the markets don’t always love him, as evidenced in 2018 and 2020. You’re right, he will do whatever it takes to keep us moving up and to the right. But the market could see through that; I’d just wait and see what he actually ends up doing before you sell everything. Ultimately he wants the markets to be solid. It’s his obsession.; EXACTLY! The blame will always and forever be shifted to Joe. The day his love affair with Elon ends, TSLA will tank 20%. And it’s only a matter of time before it does. He has had a falling out with every close supporter he has ever had, and that pattern will continue; I live near one of those dead towns. It was a huge textile hub in the 60s. Depressing as fuck now.

Just never to me. 🚬; Yet we did drop 25% in 2022, so we know it IS possible.; I can just imagine an entire generation of newish traders who either got rich on crypto or stock mania experiencing their first wipe-out of all or most of their gains. 

Just thinking about their naïveté fading fast in a moment is exciting me.

Without suffering we learn little and hubris much; Cash is at the lowest levels now since early 2000’s.

If fib is a thing then the crash would be about 60 percent “bigger”. The issue is a ression will happen but the problem is that the people of America don’t have the cash flow from their hiring company to support living in a crash. The equity is locked up so large companies can live through the recession on a company level; Gonna be YUGE; Yes, that’s my strategy as well.

I think covid and the unprecedented amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus papered over what was a weakening economy.; The 2019 crash was guaranteed in September with the famous repo fails and fed of ny bail outs. The first rumblings were in 2016 December. We were heading to complete inversion in late 2019 with the 30y and 6 month inversion which has never failed to indicate a recession yet.

Then covid happened and the rest is history.
But yes - 2019 was the year of recession and a crash in 2020 was guaranteed at that point. If it wasn’t covid there would have been some other trigger.

Problem with COVID is it gave all the governments an easy out and they borrowed like crazy. I don’t think they’ll be able to do the same with this next one.; They printed so much money in 2019 and 2020. It has artificially propped up the economy and inflated asset values. People haven’t lived a recession/bear market in a long time and it shows. People think it’s all memes and games until the inevitable crash of the everything bubble comes.; I hope he destroys ag.

To limit its spread would mean implementing practices that make meat and dairy industries lose money, as well as the fact that a large portion of the people who need regular testing are undocumented, and thus not inclined to do so. Additionally, it hops across species of wild animals incredibly efficiently, which is where it would gain the mutations to butt fuck us. 

Our vaccine stockpile for bird flu is a joke, and we have no evidence that it would be efficient against potential mutations. 

The main companies currently working on mRNA H5N1 vaccines are Moderna, Pfizer, and GSK. 

I’m long on all three.; Another reason I’m glad I’m a vegetarian/almost vegan. I don’t eat meat, eggs, and milk is only when it’s in items it’s baked in.; mRNA vaccines will address this.

Yeah, timing this is the tricky part. My gut says next year, so it'll probably be a year or two after that; They're still not widely understood. Fucking Bernanke got a nobel for thoroughly misunderstanding what happened.; Pump n Trump; I replied to someone else who made that comment, and I agree. That shouldn’t have been worded that way. My main point is whether the tariffs are actually put into place or not.; I agree and isn't it amazing that we're talking about food prices going up and inflation without even mentioning the plan to deport field workers...

So many amazing policies that are going to kick in because these guys just bullshit their own reality.; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31224); >He can’t fire Powell, even if he wants to

He also can't just take nuclear secrets from the white house and pile them up in a closet at home.

Trump did a million illegal things and never faced consequences. He clearly has the supreme court on his side. He has complete immunity while acting as president. What makes you think something like laws will stop him? 

Powell is the perfect ""inflation scapegoat"" and Trump might make a big show about going after him. If his next guy is a spineless yes man that cuts rates despite spiraling inflation, the market will crash hard...and we have seen how well Trump does in crisis mode; Yup, when you start getting stock tips from random people who otherwise aren’t involved with investing I see it as a time to take profits and sit things out for a bit.; Sell the inauguration makes as much sense as anything; Inflation certainly didn’t curtail corporate earnings, since wages largely haven’t followed along.; Your voice is so soothing…; A bit slower please.; Why didn't OP just say it like this in the first place?

Your delusional ; Yeah, I’m hoping the tariffs are mostly posture. I think he has an advisor close to him. That is a big-time tariff hawk. Hopefully the position will moderate.; The market, from 2000 until now, has traded above the highest shiller PE recorded at any point in time prior to 2000.

Thus, per shiller pe, the market has been overvalued for the past two decades.

Even looking at the article you sent, it is premised upon data through 2011.

Like any valuation metric, it has value, but only insofar as you upward adjust what you consider to be “fair value” today relative to 50 years ago. 

This notion that valuation metrics benchmarked to data dating back to 1960, are applicable equally today, is nonsense.

What were the average gross margins of the top 25 stocks in 1965 versus today?

What was the capex then versus now for the biggest 25 companies?

It’s fine to consider things the Econ textbook said are important; but if you don’t use your accounting / Econ brain to then ask, is there a reason why these metrics don’t make sense anymore? 

Is there something fundamentally diff ab companies, today, compared to 20-50 years ago?; Not too many sales going on now in the market.  I think companies that make money and get cheep relative to stock price will happen again.  Keep an eye out for undervalued assets on the balance sheet.  Like the analyst missed the value of the App Store with apple about 10 years ago.  Just my .02; A lot of companies and governments are in panic mode about the tariffs. Its a bleak outlook in the near term for sure. I appreciate your thoughtfulness on the subject.; DJT “thinks” he’s smart. He’s a big dummy, he needs to let smart people handle shit. 

I’ll say he does do one smart thing: he will listen to opinions then form his opinion it seems, right or wrong.; This is Trump's second presidency, he will not have a third obviously. This is the situation where presidents start to care more about their legacy than re-election. So I would guess this is the time where he will be bold and choose radical measures.

And actually the cutting of the deficit opens up a nice, totally overlooked play in the markets: US debt. If you study market history, there is a bit of an oddball story about baron Rotschild, how he became truly rich. He bet on Britain winning the Napoleonic wars and figured that after the war the state would not need that much funding, so the very lucrative war bonds would not be issued anymore. But the demand for debt was still there, a lot of market participants wanted to safeguard their money by lending it to the government. By discontinuing the war bonds they decreased supply without tackling demand. So the baron stocked up on government bonds with as much leverage as he could afford. As the yield on government bonds plummeted due to high demand and low supply, he sold everything with an immense profit.

Now we have a peculiar situation that I rarely see mentioned anywhere: the almighty Dollar is the world currency indeed, but not just the physical cash, but the US debt also. The M2 money supply is at around 21 trillion, but the federal debt stands at 27 trillion. The government deficit is estimated to be 1.8 trillion per year. But this means that there are market participants buying this debt. There is a demand for that amount of US treasuries. Social security runs on them exclusively, but every 60/40 investor buys them for their 401k accounts, banks, insurance companies, foreign investors buy all this debt every year. Hell I have a large batch of US Treasuries despite living in Hungary, because I would not touch Hungarian government bonds with a ten foot pole.

But what happens if the government starts to issue less of it? There are hordes of investors who buy them, what happens if the demand stays the same but the supply dwindles? Investors will depress yields, creating immense profit for anyone holding long-term US government bonds. You see the present value of bonds inversely correlates with their yield. Long-term treasuries suffered a 50% loss in the bear market following the FED's rate hikes in the last two years. A collapse of bond yields would have an inverse effect, if the yield on 20+ year treasuries would collapse to the absolute low values experienced before, a 100% profit could materialize.

All I am saying that if someone would be absolutely sure that the US deficit will be tackled could stock up on long-term treasuries even on margin and reap insane profits. And yes, a nice bear market would motivate boomers to finally ditch stocks and convert their wealth to bonds, which would increase demand even more.; It only melts up now.;  Oh, it *happens all the time*. Except to *me*...

Will Emerson: Margin Call; Didnt even take a year to shoot back up higher than it was before the crash; That’s priced in!; My 🍑 hurts 😢; I just ate half a bag of chocolate covered Donettes; No problem! No chatgpt in this bitch; Yeah blow off top first. Who’s riding this shit all the way over the peak with me! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882); Crash on the horizon has been the story since Covid started. I lean bear and even I am unconvinced a crash will occur. They are just too good at propping things up, and there are real external wildcard investors like Canada has seen in real estate to relate it to just our country's situation. Bad investments for us are still good investments for external players.

I do know I am feeling financially unhappy due solely to inflation and taxes. Our income is in the top 10% and getting killed, but my friends and family with less income have really ramped up their verbal dissatisfaction quite a bit more. Wages are not keeping up, and it is really pushing to a point where there could be a revolution (why Luigi was so popular), or a huge crash to raise up the middle/lower classes in terms of wage vs CoL for those that are still employed. Same exact feelings of 2008. 

Manufacturing is not coming back to the US without huge CoL adjustments via subsidization or tariffs. But there is no situation in which inflation does not go up here. But sometimes national security reigns supreme, and I think this may be what is happening here. I am fine with that if it means staying on top while keeping China, Russia and Saudi Arabia in their place. But none of those paths are fun.; ""When?"" is the million dollar question; And the administration at the time said oh don’t listen to that the yield curve means nothing. We had many indicators telling us where we were headed, Covid hit and caused confusion, it pulled some industries like trucking out of their recession and into a boom only to be here in the present in an even deeper recession for the over correction; I find it very interesting that no one talks about the pre-Covid real estate market. We were headed for a big recession in the housing market. I remember reading articles in 2019 on what to do with the over built luxury housing market in the suburbs. No one was buying. Covid hits and luxury suburbs that had sold 4 houses in the prior year suddenly sold 100 houses. Without Covid those houses were headed for a huge price drop. Suddenly they almost doubled in value from the bidding war. 

The only thing propping up the housing market now is scarcity. People with 3% mortgages are not moving. Next year is going to be a struggle bus for real estate.; > Problem with COVID is it gave all the governments an easy out and they borrowed like crazy. I don’t think they’ll be able to do the same with this next one.

Why not? The FED can QE infitine money; so can other central banks. That will flow into markets because there's no mechanism for it to get anywhere else, and a tiny fraction of that trickles through to regular people.

If it gets bad enough that governments actually have to wake up to the problem and implement Keynesian stimulus, there being enough money is not an issue. The real problem is they probably won't do that until there's rioting in the streets, because wealthy interests hate diluting the value of their assets.; A good old war to cover the next one and Everything solved; Dumb people voting for “better economy” absolutely deserve the disaster because of their stupidity; That would be horrible for the USA.

Without vaccines, the next thing to do is to cull all animals on every farm that has it in the US. 

Unfortunately, since they also want to do away with all reporting - we won't even know we're consuming contaminated products.; Yeah I read the Yuan trade is still on. What are your thoughts on that?; Trump n Dump; I love you; Exactly. If you compiled a list of things people would have said a president ""can't do"" prior to his first term that he actually did, legal or not, firing someone before their term is up would be one of the least shocking things.

Like you said, who's going to stop him? He's got the House, Senate, and Supreme Court stacked with people who simply do not give a shit, not to mention an incredible amount of judges at the federal level.

Unfortunately one of the extreme weaknesses in our government is the fact that the checks and balances sort of assume that the majority of people have good intentions and will act morally/ethically. If that goes out the window, what is there to do (other than voting... we'll see how the next round goes). Americans do not protest in a way to cause any change at the national level.; True

Yes, the market has been remarkably overvalued compared to historical norms for nearly 30 years. I blame Fed chairs from Greenspan through Powell, who depressed credit yields to goose the economy. They created an economy based around asset inflation, especially in McMansions, rather than around manufacturing prowess and profit. This will *all* unwind in time.

The article I offered was based around 10 year returns through 2021. I don't think an update to Dec 2024 would change the picture much.

The picture is very simple. Anyone can get nearly risk-free 10 year returns at 4.39% today. The earnings yield of the S&P 500 which normally trades at a risk premium is 3.24%, that of the Nasdaq 100 is 2.59%. For those who aren't inclined to stock-pick, the equity market indices aren't values today.

Personally, I've done well for myself scouring for value stocks for 25 years, something managers with lots of funds under management can't do. Micro/mid caps isn't their playground. I profit less than them in momo years, but my drawdowns for the crashes have been small. There will always be relative values. I anticipate that 2025, as in 2000, 2008, and 2020, I will be goosing my returns with select shorts, which I usually avoid.; Time for a TLT run?; I've thought about this.

It seems that people have amnesia about what Trump did in his first term the first couple of years. The market wasn’t doing well because of the tariffs he imposed and the trade war with China. And now he wants to expand his tariffs to Canada, Mexico and Brics.

I'm actually baffled how these people with the internet and information at their fingertips, didn't just google 'countries with tariffs'.

Go check out how much a PS5 costs in Brazil and why. Or understand why Embraer has never taken off. Or you know, the Brexit fiasco and how much both hurt (but especially the UK) from reinstating tariffs. Here's a hint, it hasn't really helped. Here's an excerpt from chatgpt, because I'm lazy: Despite these opportunities, recent data indicates a downturn in manufacturing output. Forecasts for 2024 predict a 0.2% contraction in manufacturing output, a downgrade from earlier growth projections. This decline is attributed to factors such as rising costs, labor shortages, and economic uncertainties.; I mean I’m kidding. My job obviously depends on it, but also I’m not kidding, I hate these people.; We all deserve it for being so fuckin dumb bro.; Thanks, bot, but I’m dumb as hell.; Correct. 

However, Moderna has already received their funding for it, and it’s currently in phase 2. 

Pfizer has also had their development underway for some time already. 

GSK is partially immune to American stupidity given that they cater more to European populations. 

My thesis is that there will be initial denial strong enough to let things get out of hand, at which point we will have no choice but to implement something akin to another Operation Warpspeed. 

In my opinion, the longer we drag our feet on vaccination, the more certain I am that we will eventually need mass vaccination.; This could also be a part of a depopulation scheme, we all know resources are running out and global warming is going to destroy agriculture, why not let nature takes its course a little early to soften the blow?

Puts on AAPL,"It’s been a year since I’ve traded apple, I hate apple… but either I’m missing something or I see a good opportunity. Apple has gone up over 11% in the past month with no draw back.

Luck; Apple has a lot to worry about right now.

The stock may be up 35% YTD but their earnings per share in September were down about 1% YoY.

Apple’s fundamentals have been pretty flat for the last 2 years. Their last couple phone releases have been underwhelming, they’re not penetrating the global market due to pricing, their last phone software update hasn’t been received well.

I think that there are really only so many iPads, phones, and earbuds people are willing to buy. I think most of the reason they’re bought today is because of the status symbol they represent. However that will eventually change. Consumer brands do come and go.

They’ll be around for a long time, probably the rest of all of our lives, but I’m buying all the other tech companies besides apple right now.; In my experience, especially with apple… when it has no draw back in a month, it implodes.

The big boys getting bigger?,"I’ve been really reviewing and tweaking my overall portfolio recently and it has gotten me reading lots of threads and articles about diversification(small/mid cap, international, sp500) etc. With that rotating some QQQM/VGT/VOO into assets like VTI/VXUS/VT  as I previously had little to no exposure to things outside the USA large caps. 

However, I can’t help but help but feel like buying anything but the biggest companies is just going to weigh down the portfolio.

Hear me out, we see the biggest tech companies gobbling up more and more market share as Mag7 with hands in everything along with the other top companies. They wield so much market influence and power over any competition. Just saw an article about Walmart/amazon/costco picking up something like 60% of every incremental dollar on retail this year. It’s happening within every industry. Hospitals being gobbled up, grocery chains, cell phone providers, airlines, etc. 

In addition everything in the US is designed with extracting more and more money from people and funneling to these mega corporations. With hardly anything protecting everyday Americans from rampant greed, Whether it’s for profit healthcare, no mandated sick/PTO time, taxes/fees increasing at every level(sales tax, income tax, city taxes, car registration, insurance premiums, etc.), among many other things that other countries at least somewhat still protect. Congress is clearly bought by corporations and benefits by trading in these companies with legal inside trading and thus have negative incentive to change this status quo of the bigger getting bigger. 

At no point in history have so few companies wielded such vast global control and had such little regulation to stop them from continuing to bully their way over anyone smaller. 

TLDR: My conviction was and is that in this late stage capitalism world we live in. Especially in America.. there is no competing with the big boys. As money gets funneled to the ultra wealthy at an exponentially increasing pace people have less money and then end up spending with the biggest companies who have pricing and volume power over not just mom and pop shops but anyone not already dominating their respective market. So any diversification into non top companies is really a losing proposal. VOO, QQQM, and SCHG or similar tickers will only continue to accelerate and provide outsized returns vs most other categories. 

Not financial advise. Just my thoughts. Curious as to the communities thoughts. Let here some discussion.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hgfji2/the_big_boys_getting_bigger/,141,2024-12-17 18:16:06,"With all the big tech companies coming out in full force for Trump there is absolutely no chance of antitrust enforcement against any of them, so that potential risk to OP’s thesis seems out for now.; This sentiment could easily be applied to the world in 1900 as well:

>Here’s my thinking: it feels like anything besides the largest and most established companies is going to weigh down the portfolio. Hear me out. We’re seeing the largest companies—like the steel and railroad barons, the oil trusts, and the big utilities—gobbling up more and more market share. Companies like Standard Oil, U.S. Steel, and American Tobacco are consolidating entire industries. They’re gaining so much market power, they control not just their competitors, but entire sectors of the economy. I just read a report showing that Standard Oil alone controls nearly every major refinery in the country. The same thing is happening in the railroads, utilities, and even in agriculture—giants like J.P. Morgan & Co. and Rockefeller are picking up smaller players everywhere.

History rhymes, same as ever.; >At no point in history have so few companies wielded such vast global control and had such little regulation to stop them from continuing to bully their way over anyone smaller.

Have you got any numbers to substantiate this claim? Because I'm going to say the East India Company was uh, doing a lot of things back then, with even less regulation. The Dutch East India company could singlehandedly wage war, mint coins, and execute convicts, and it traded in the Dutch stock market.; [deleted]; Mega caps are already priced at a much higher P/E and P/B than small caps. So the question is not if large caps will grow faster, but rather, will they grow faster than the market already expects.; What type of investing are you intending this logic to apply to?  


If it's safe and long term returns like retirement, I think it fits pretty well. No one is likely to launch a successful Walmart competitor or new search engine.  


However, I don't think this logic holds up to many high growth industries and companies but you have to actually be specific about what you're referring to in that case. 


There will absolutely be pharma companies that do 100x that the large stable companies will not do. 


One or two of the air taxis companys will give a massive return that Airbus or Boeing never will. 


There's multiple smaller defense firms that will big huge returns vs LM/NOC/BA. 


There will certainly be green tech winners. 


Etc.; I completely agree with your assessment and almost all of my money is in FXIAX, however it will only take one mildly aggressive DOJ/FTC/etc to spook the market into investing less into these companies or heaven forbid actually take profits and begin the selling process.; I agree with you and have been almost all VOO for awhile. I am rotating ~10% to VXUS to get some diversification with a little drag on returns though.

I also think there are fewer small growth companies in the public markets now. By the time a company goes public, much of the growth has been extracted by private markets. Look at SpaceX or OpenAI. Now that normies can access IPOs fairly regularly, the rich have simply moved farther up the investment chain.; Generally speaking your not wrong, except with this bit...

> At no point in history have so few companies wielded such vast global control and had such little regulation to stop them from continuing to bully their way over anyone smaller. 

People forget their history, and how big some companies where in the past.  The Dutch East India Company, when adjusted for inflation hasn't been rivaled.  As big as our biggest companies are today, they still don't hold a candle to The Dutch East India Company, and there are a few other historical behemoths out there.

As people commonly say, history rhymes, things are very similar today to when Teddy Roosevelt started his many antitrust actions and broke up the organizations of the likes of Rockefellers, Carnegies and Morgans.

We have more rules and regulations than ever before, but that benefits those big companies who can fight never ending legal battles as part of usual business, or can afford to meet certain regulations by spending large capital investments that are unachievable by small local companies.

We need a modern version of Teddy Roosevelt and the square deal, for something of a system reset, and at least as far as I have seen we don't have one sitting in the wings.; A lot of the *big boys* are so ingrained in our life it's quite something. 

Search the web? Google Search

Messaging people? (Meta (whatsapp)

Business software? (Microsoft Office)

Artificial Intelligence? (Nvidia, AWS, GCP, Azure) 

LLMs? (ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot) 

And these are all *global* companies. With countries all over the world depending on their products/services to varying degrees.; > .. late stage capitalism.. no competing with the big boys

Well, in the futuristic film Demolition Man (1995), all the restaurants became Taco Bell and who am I to argue with Sandra Bullock? 

Seriously speaking, several big stocks have fizzled out that past investors/customers thought were impervious: Howard Johnson’s, Radio Shack, Sears, Monkey Wards, .. while others spontaneously combusted like Enron, Worldcom, etc.  Some long standing financial firms in 2008. 

In most sectors (not all) there’s up and coming competition ..  both companies and trends.  I’d also say IMHO part is a slight inflationary bias of most central banks post-2008 vs. anger at “shrinkflation”, .. boredom.  However you can imagine the shock of *all* the big brands failing at once (stock market, commercial real estate market ->mortgage market), which is why they’ll get thrown a lifeboat in case of a “crash”.

Any stock could go to zero, but the chances of all the stocks going to zero is nil, which is why this sub-reddit usually recommends “funds” (totally or partially).  Then there’s diversification which usually means high quality bonds (or funds of those) to offset stock mkt crashes.  

That said, there will be a crash sooner or later, having seen 1988 (though too young) and then being invested during 2008, luckily having a little bit in bond funds.   Most never see it coming, btw. 

My observation?  **The financial markets have the comeback ability of a cockroach in a Bangkok apartment kitchen**.; I agree with you, wealth consolidation will continue and investments like VOO and QQQ will be most fruitful. I still maintain all market exposure in my Roth with a Vanguard TDF but still most of my portfolio and future contributions are and will be VOO; Agree, I've started to buy S&P 500 Top 20 etf for this very reason. Own the biggest and best because they have their hands in pretty much everything. Don't see that changing in the future. ETF also rebalances quarterly so will capture the next big company moving in.; I agree as well. Every new tech company has the sole goal of being bought out by a FAANG. I think that betting on large caps is the best move going forward. These companies just have too much power and money.; >Not financial advise.

I am going to take this as financial advice and sue your ass; OEF (iShares S&P 100) has been my go to ETF for the last 5 years and I feel stronger about it now than ever before.  It’s a dog eat dog world and the big dogs will continue to grow bigger and bigger…

Compare the returns to VTI, SPY, etc. and you’ll see OEF has produced better returns for a while now. And yes, I consider 10 years a good stretch of time. 

For example, using Vanguards ETF comparison tool, it shows OEF’s 10 year return outperformed VOO 14.08% to 13.33%, annualized. In terms of cumulative returns, OEF outperformed VOO by 7.5% over the 10 year stretch. Two people investing 1 million dollars 10 years ago and the person using OEF would be 75K wealthier. Not bad…

1 year returns? OEF at 39.53% while VOO is at 36.36%. 

5 year annualized? OEF is at 17.69% while VOO is at 15.93%. Thats a ridiculous 8.8% greater cumulative return being in OEF over a 5 year period compared to VOO. You can’t ignore those returns. 

There’s absolutely no way this pattern is changing. Not for the next 4 years, at least.; The US may likely become an Oligarchy. You're right in that lots of funneling schemes are happening, such as crypto hype, Tesla stock. The suckers are the ones who get FOMO, because thats exactly what these ponzi schemes target.; There’s a saying “the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.” My investment strategy reflects this saying.; I agree but caveat that big tech will win in ways that incumbents in other industries can't match. I think there is still a lot of growth headroom in tech and if you look at the SP500 over the last 30 years, tech is becoming a larger component of it for good reason. Even at current valuations, the many of the Mag 7 still have room to grow and compound.; Well, VOO and VTI basically have the same returns. I wouldn't be surprised if VT returns weren't pretty close to them too.

VGT and QQQM both cover tech and have a lot of the same overlap. While I do believe diversification (especially into international) is important, you can still simply your portfolio by just putting it all into VOO and QQQM.; I can think at least 5 ways things can get even worse. But in the end it all begins by trading freedom with convenience; Look at the largest companies in the world each decade starting from the 1900’s and you will find that this has never been true and will never be true.; It's cause Europe decided to shoot its foot; Is there anyone I can talk to,this is to much 😭😭😭😭 I feel like giving up in life 😭; This is just the transition period to full technocracy by interplanetary corporations. Weyland-Yutani will be SpaceX, Google will be Tyrell Corp, Omni Consumer Products will be Amazon/Apple, Cyberdyne will be Palantir. The new government will be CHOAM.; I agree. There is an argument to be made about concentrating in 1 mega corp but for all of them to fail at the same time would be impossible. They're too important for the US economy if they actually do then it is unlikely the rest of the market would survive anyway. Generally if QQQ is at its peak then I would put some money into other indices that are down but my main vehicle is QQQ.; I think it depends on a couple factors. Gen Z is said to have shunned retirement saving already so my questions are if that actually is the case, does that mean the number of those throwing money in ETFs is being outstripped by the number of those retiring/selling off/withdrawing? And is that enough to taper an upward trending market? Do institutional investors create enough volume to offset that? Maybe I'm looking at this part the wrong way, otherwise I agree with most that have said anti-trust will be largely curbed under Trump, which with exception to a past blocked merger or two holds true.; https://www.ft.com/content/9a0da0d6-92b4-4034-ac25-7b4abcbb0bbe

Interesting perspective; I agree that we will trend towards bigger and bigger entities with little anti-trust enforcement in the next few years. However, as an investor, won't you miss out on the big guys buying out smaller entities? Typically a stock is bought out at a higher than market rate. If more of this happens, then smaller companies become better investments.; Look up factor investing. Plenty of academic research and historical evidence suggests that there are five factors that outperform for the same risk. Specifically answering your question, small cap performs better than large cap.

It's true that over the last 10 years large cap have outperformed but it's also well known that investors recency bias leads them to underperform.; How much you earn by large company going from 1000 to 1100 (so big absolute value) or small company going from 50 to 100 (so small absolute value)… but relatively? see Nvidia 10 or 5 years back; Hard to argue against the 'big boys' dominance...Mag7 and their ilk seem unstoppable. Diversification is wise, but betting against the mega caps in this landscape feels like swimming upstream.; People who describe current America as ""late capitalism"" have no idea how bad things can really get.; You’ve got a solid point. The big players are dominating everything, and it’s tough to see how smaller companies can compete. It feels like we’re in a stage where betting on the largest, most powerful companies makes more sense—they’ve got the cash, influence, and reach to keep expanding. But, diversification can still play a role. Even if the big boys keep growing, having some exposure outside of them can offer safety in case things change. It’s all about balancing that dominance with strategic risk.; The current big boys weren’t big boys 30 years ago. If you skipped Apple, Nvidia, Google, Facebook, and Amazon because they obviously couldn’t compete with Intel, Microsoft, IBM, Walmart, or Yahoo, you would have missed out today. 

Fundamentally it’s about potential growth. A $22b company will have a far harder time growing to $44b than a $2.2m company to $4.4m.; Unfortunately the only things that seem to unbalance a world order seems to be a war. So until we see another World War, things like this may not change. I pray for no war though, but I am unsure what could stop this imbalance.; I'll sell when the riots seem to be working, but so far betting on the corporations is the way to go.; I have to admit that the first thing I thought of when I was reading this post was ""East India Tea Company""!; Yeah, my mind immediately went to Standard Oil and US Steel.; I've seen estimates that in todays dollars the Dutch East India Company would be valued at 7.9 Trillion dollars and literally had its own fleet of ships and an army of 10,000 men.; No hard numbers other than most people in the world can go a day without using a product that at some point is touched/controlled by one of these top players today. Did that Dutch East India company have the ability to reach a billion to 5 billion users at any instant and control what they saw or emotions to feel. Im sure they controlled vast amounts of power and resources but I just don’t think it compares to where these current giants are.; “Now you’re not naive enough to think we’re living in a democracy are you buddy?”

Iconic; Would be a lot more appropriate to reference median net worth for the top 1%. Average going to be skewed heavily by the 0.001%; P/B is irrelevant for tech companies; Absolutely agree that there will be new players in many different industries emerging that individually have huge returns. But I’m moreso discussing as a collective of small Caps etfs, total ex-US funds, etc. that I don’t see competing with etfs that focus on holding the biggest companies. 
So sure a new pharma will pop off for 1000x return or a new software company will, but there are going to be plenty that fail to win against the giants and go under when the giant creates a dupe of their product or service.; > several big stocks have fizzled out that past investors/customers thought were impervious

Intel. In the 90s, they were *the* de-facto tech hardware blue chip.

R.I.P. Nana.

Transparency: Intel shareholder; And it’s a big But…; Just remember the consolidation to large cap American stocks has been a powerful 10-14 year trend, but for about 10 years before that it was all about ex-US (especially China and emerging markets) and small caps, and big US companies seemed very passe.       These trends seem most rock solid right before they are completely wrong.; You are betting on something that has never happened happening.

Could argue at this point you've missed the 10,000% growth of that company to get to that point and only brought in for the single / double digit growth from then on?; Why not IYW? Outperforms OEF. Just curious.; It already is a oligarchy, it's just coming more blatant.; What about VUG vs VGT?

Like you mention institutional investors might support for a bit but doesn’t the bottom fall out when no one is feeding those funds?; Exactly. It’s been like this forever; I guess I kind of agree but I think we’re in the beginning stages, and it’s to say that on the pendulum of capitalism we’re currently in a far swing right now.; This sounds the most chatgptish of all the comments; Exactly my feelings. Unless there is a global revolt against modern day capitalism and governments being controlled by corps, I just don’t see how it could change.; > I'll sell when the riots seem to be working

Are there riots anymore? Been a few years at this point since the last good ones, hasn't it? People barely protest for like a week and then move on.; I would dare say that owning one million slaves, a monopoly on trade, and having the ability to wage war is ""more powerful"" than showing you ads on a phone, but maybe I'm just old fashioned.; [deleted]; That's how it has always been.  The small etfs are based around a smaller number of companies having hugely outsized gains.

Also, you are way overestimating the capabilities of large companies.  Smaller companies are much more efficient and much better able to focus on the specific things that make their products good.  Bureaucracy, institutional momentum, and free loader employees who contribute almost nothing but stay on payroll are huge problems for big companies.  Middle management is necessary but also extremely wasteful and ripe for abuse and exploitation.

Many times big companies will buy a smaller one and then proceed to begin trashing what made the small company valuable, which costs customers (but increases profit, for a time).  Sometimes they earn more than they paid before the product line has lost a ton of value, sometimes they're able to fold it into their existing lines without losing their value proposition, and sometimes they accidentally kill their revenue & profit before they ROI, while customers go to a competitor.

Look at Broadcom buying VMWare for an example that may or may not backfire.  They increased profit a lot, but are hemorragging customers to competitors.; I think you need to factor risk into your model. 


If you buy a global ETF or Russel 5000 or something with a huge collection of companies you're getting a lower risk level in exchange for lower return. 


I believe large companies out-performing small cap is also only the last 10-20 years as well so there's likely additional broad market factors that have changed. Those could change again in the future but you'd have to do more research on why that happened.; That’s right; The thing is that 10,000% growth would come from a smaller company that would be weighted maybe between 0.10-0.03% in the S&P 500 (https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500). So an initial 500k investment would mean only 150 of my money was in it. So how much growth of your money would you have really seen?

Compared to having way more of my money in the best of the best with larger weightings (https://www.ishares.com/us/products/339779/ishares-top-20-us-stocks-etf). 

I don’t want to buy small cap etfs as many of the businesses could fail. 

Just like money compounds over time, i have the same view with large monster companies compounding and swallowing up everything in their way over time.

I’ll caveat this with saying i have a large portfolio so i don’t need 100x baggers, just consistent single/double digit growth.; They are both tech heavy. I wouldn't have both in the same account.; VGT is a specific information technology fund.

Look at their holdings, you won't see all the Mag 7 in there.

I hold VGT it's been amazing.

If I put in 200k 10 years ago I'd be 1.3 million today (I didn't but I wish I did).; Well, lower volume of trading might hamper prices but ultimately the stock is also a reflection of the value of the company/companies the stock holds. As long as Gen Z is working then I can't see a huge drop off in value but maybe we'll see slower growth. It might also just be a cultural trend that started with Millenials where saving started slightly later as an average based on things like general cost of living and stagnant entry level wages.; eh, I feel like this summer will pick up where 2020 left off, but who knows; I guess I didn’t realize how big they were but found the below on a quick search. 

“The East India Company was probably the most powerful corporation in history. At its height, it dominated global trade between Europe, South Asia and the Far East, fought numerous wars using its own army and navy, and conquered and colonised modern day India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Burma.“

But this honestly sounds more like a pseudo empire/nation with its military more than just being a business.; The dollar isn't trying to fuck you over because it has narcissistic and emotional tendencies though; Does the expense ratio matter to you when comparing the two ETFs?; There is always more protesting when the democrats aren't in office since they fund a lot of them, no need to fund protest when it would be against yourself.; Well, there's some distinction to be made between the East India Company (British, called EIC), the Dutch East India Company (Dutch, called VOC), as they were actually competing and even at war with each other at times I think, etc. But I would say both were pretty big business rivaling the power of states, yes. Still companies though, any citizen of the Dutch Republic could buy stock in the VOC in the Amsterdam Stock Exchange in \~1600, and apparently the dividends were really good. In fact, I think the VOC was the first company with an IPO in the world.; One is .04 and the other .1. The expense ratio can matter, but IMO with these two, no.; As I just stated in another thread it's a big club & you ain't in it.; Your not wrong.  I did jump over to that other thread, and I do get a chuckle about the pardons.  I know one of the people who got one, and he is not in any club what so ever.  He made the local news in a WTF this guy is pardoned story, but not one of the crazy ones to make the national news, that said, it convinced me that the pardons this go around was computer generated and not reviewed."

You should buy leaps on SPY; Name verified; Less risk; Mara is the second biggest bitcoin holder behind MSTR, they have a lower cost of capital than any other bitcoin miner, they have a higher hash rate than any bitcoin miner, bitcoin will likely explode in 2025 due to purchases by the US government and all foreign governments, many companies will likely begin to purchase bitcoin in 2025, taking a page out of MSTRs book. MARA will continue to purchase bitcoin. MARA builds their own cooling systems which allows them to overclock their miners up to 80%. MARA has the cheapest energy costs of any miner and they continue to get cheaper.

I don’t know what makes you say that. But you do you.; I’ve honestly been only plays swings and long contracts as of recently. Orange hair guy is gonna make us some gooooood money; And OTM options are hella expensive; Because of the volatility. 

Not the fact that it won’t go up in price.

It’s that vega will cause you to lose money. 


How long have you been trading options?; Exactly; OTM options are always cheaper. Because they have no intrinsic value.; I understand what you’re saying I just disagree. For that to happen MARA would have to stay under $32 for over a year. I think that’s highly unlikely; Soooooo…. Those Mara calls; Yes lol; And what you’re saying only applies if I hold till expiration. IV will remain high for the foreseeable future. If it pops in the next few months this will fly; They didn’t do well. Evaporated my gains this year. Huge L; My next questions are;

How long do you intend on holding? 

Are you managing delta with any type of strategy?

Lastly, if we see a 5% decline what do you see the price of the leaps at? 

Not trying to poke hole, genuinely curious. I lost a lot on leaps with PLTR years ago; I have a black scholes python script I could check but honestly my rationale is just not that technical. I think stock go up within year. I buy calls. I no worry about Vega because I think IV will remain high the whole time. No price target

You forget this is WSB and I’m a regard; I chose higher delta to manage risk; I’m looking forward to seeing your payout; Me too if there is a payout. MARA down 10% today 🥲"

Don't conflate that need with anything about theFed meeting.; Both of those companies are on my “buy and hold forever” list.  If you need some money or something ok, but 20 years from now my mouth waters at their possible value haha; I'm looking at the December 20 options and there was no froth yesterday morning but the froth has returned so a lot of open interest at $250 - $255 today. I sold $250 covered calls for $1.85 yesterday and will be fine with getting called out.

I actually love Apple's M4 launch and they will continue to roll out devices in Q1 and Q2. The only thing that I'm worried about is the iPhone. 

I like Amazon as well because Apple is using Amazon's AI chips for their AI endeavors. I am not currently long AMZN but I do like them.

Warren Buffett sold a lot of his Apple stock though he said it was more for tax purposes. He's sitting on a huge cash pile.

There are absolutely good reasons to book profits or use a hedging strategy.; Sure, sell and hedge with some calls."
NVDA vs AVGO,"NVDIA vs Broadcom
I have a pretty big position in NVDA but am obviously not too thrilled with the stock performance since June.

While I am still bullish on NVIDIA and AI, there are a few things that make me pause

Apple doing its whole Apple Intelligence thing not planning to spend a single dollar with NVIDIA but rather building custom chips with Broadcom
Anthropic going all-in with Amazon's Trainium chips. In the past, big funding for AI startups meant a big check for Jensen. This didn't happen here and could set a precedent
Broadcom announcing that it will build 1 million XPU (ASIC) data centers with hyperscalers.
So while NVIDIA is clearly ahead of AMD, I don't like the shift to Broadcom ASIC chips. And to be honest it makes a lot of sense to me that Meta or Amazon would build their own chips to do stuff like recommendation engines.

So my question is: would you diversify/sell some NVDA stock to buy AVGO in order to be able to benefit both from the GPU and ASIC trends?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hg7zpe/nvda_vs_avgo/,12,2024-12-17 11:42:53,"

[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse); You know that NVDA will pump when you sells 😏; Buying AMD ![img](emote|t5_2th52|52627); Avgo announced AI chips blah blah. 
But NVDA already producing the AI chips

See the difference ?; So you’re basically asking if you should chase the hype? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); I hold both; NVDA already has the future built in. AVGO had not, and AMZN has been lagging for years. 

Riding tide lifts all boats, and NVDA has gone so high as to be grounded.; I try not to buy right after the 40% spike unless there's really clear reason there's going to be another one.

Willing to bet if you're interested in AVGO, you can probably get in cheaper if you're patient.

Also, who's building all those chips for Amazon? What's their market cap?; When you come to a stock picker's fork in the road always remember to ask yourself what would nancy do.; It’s not a case of ‘vs’.; Yes, chase the regarded dragon. ; I think the world (or TAM) is big enough for several big players. Nvidia is the only one with a full stack platform though, all the way from hardware to networking to software. I think that will be very hard to compete with. ; Cool story.; I’d say NVDA is better but I like both companies.; Broadcom has been acting like a lil bitch lol; Per NASDAQ, NVDA’s forward PE for 2027 is 26.8. It’s not too expensive in my opinion. But even so, I own NVDA, AVGO, and AMD. Why choose?; Why not buy Nasdaq and gain exposure to all?; i read somewhere that NVDA is up 1600% this year and AVGO is only up 1200% so maybe people comparatively see more upside in broadcom...; Haha of course it will; The last time a AVGO executive made a purchase of stock was last year. Everyone has been consistently selling stock over the last year.; Who is You?; Lisa Su lost all my money; Buying AMC; Broadcom makes custom chips for very specific and specialized tasks, and AI accelerators. Qualcomm does the same thing, so does intel and AMD and Marvel and every other semi producer. They dont have a NVDA competitive advantage or a moat.; The difference is there’s more upside for more risk; The right answer. ; Also non programmers don't understand how big NVIDIA is ahead, ever since I worked with ML and LLMs and computer vision it has been clear to me: CUDA is NVIDIA'S moat. There is not much like it, things like opencl and rocm don't have the same adoption.; this is more of a rising tide eats your lunch type of deal; Making a come back rn tho; Can you sell today then? Thanks.; They might have a moat.; Yeap agreed. There are a lot of semi conductor companies. 
But cannot fight with NVDA. 

I still prefer nvda.; Yes, and this as well.; This is the answer. CUDA will take 5-10 years for anyone to create their own framework. Where will NVDA be in 5-10 years? 25 years ahead.; Sell some AMD stock while you're at it as well. Papa needs a new CPU."
Rate my portfolio - turnover advice,"I'd appreciate a feedback on my current portfolio. Here are the positions with the % size.

AAPL 2.3%
QQQ 11.4%
DELL 2.8%
IONQ 56.9%
IWQU (iShares World Maxi Quality factor sector neutral) 4.6%
LVMH 3.6%
NVDA 5.7%
SMH 2.1%
CASH 4.1%
Saving deposit (tracking 1Y TBill) 5.9%

All of this are at decent gains, except for DELL which is currently at a -27% loss and I am planning to cut it entirely. IONQ obviously has achieved an extreme gain and I am aware of the concentration risk. I have a price in mind at which I will trim some profit, but I am comfortable with the risk of seeing my portfolio volatility spiking up just because of that position.

In addition to the above holdings and outside of my trading account, I have another 10% in my banking account and I am saving for a mortgage deposit over the next year. Pension contribution is sorted out and my income and earning potential are decent enough to afford the investment risk of my portfolio. 

QQQ and IWQU are the two long term holdings that I am building; I plan to increase these two over time with further contributions and gains from other positions.

CASH is there for buying opportunities if the market dips at any point.

SAVING DEPOSIT might be invested or transferred to my bank account for the mortgage deposit.

I'd like to have your opinion for what I am planning to do with my holdings. I am thinking of the following alternatives:

- sell DELL and LVMH and invest everything in QQQ and IWQU with a 70/30 split
- sell DELL, keep some in CASH, invest the rest in other high risks names that I have been following. 

The reason of these two alternatives is that I prefer not to touch IONQ because it has the potential to generate a life changing wealth, but if I lose it all I am okay with it, and as such I'd rather raise cash from a low growth holding (DELL) and from LVMH that might still grow but I am okay with the profit that I made so far.

I am looking at the evolution of the Semiconductors, hence why I am not touching SMH. I think that the sector has more room to run in 2025, but it will be the next one to liquidate and move to my two long term holdings.

Thanks!

I like the idea of focusing more on QQQ and IWQU long term. Keeping some cash on the side is always a good move for opportunities. Keep at it!; Depends on your age and your goals.

The Dow Theory & Merry Christmas 🎁🎄 ,"Volatility remains relatively high, making options trades more lucrative as the payouts are amplified by IV. Too much institutional and retail money is piled into the same trades, leaving markets vulnerable to cascading selloffs. 

Momentum strategies rely on positive autocorrelation (recent winners keep winning). Once negative returns emerge, negative autocorrelation sets in, driving sharp reversals as positions unwind.

Buy Put Options:
Target broad market indices like SPY (S&P 500 ETF) or QQQ (Nasdaq-100 ETF) AAPL, TSLA with expirations in 30-60 days to capture near-term downside.

Vertical Put Spreads (For Efficiency):
Example: Buy a SPY $460 put, sell the $450 put to reduce premium costs while maintaining solid downside exposure.

Go for an asset allocation ETF like XEQT or VEQT for a better risk-adjusted returns using just a single ETF. XEQT or VEQT has every relevant stock across the globe including Emerging Markets which matter. Both of these can be held into TFSA & RRSP as well as Non-Reg if required. If you want to be an actual passive investor and ride the gains from the Market, then both of these ETFs will fulfill that criteria. Additionally, they are canadian-domiciled ETFs which means no need to get bothered by FX conversion fees when buying US domiciled etfs or stocks.

Please don’t chase past performance by investing in Thematic ETFs like QQQM, VUG, VONG, SMH, VGT, FTEC, SCHG, etc. or Canadian Equivalents like XIT.TO, TEC.TO, QQC.TO, etc. as they introduce uncompensated risk into your portfolio which may often provide short-term growth but stagnate over long run as compared to broad market ETFs. And their MER is mostly high comparative to an Index Fund ETF which increases your average weighted portfolio MER as a result.

Just buying either one of these ETFs would make your life easier by simply DCA’ing or Lump Sum investing into it whenever you have cash available. Wealthsimple offers fractional shares but both of them are on lower end of share price, so it’d be convenient to purchase a full share even if you have accounts in other brokerages and they don’t offer fractional shares.

Also, having a 20-30% home bias i.e., for Canada will make your portfolio robust in terms of risk-adjusted returns.

Note: This is simply a suggestion. I am not a financial advisor nor have any personal interests vested in iShares or Vanguard. Please do your own due dilligence and necessary research before investing money into the stock market. Lastly, past performance, including current performance doesn’t guarantee equivalent future performance.; Yes; Yes, but rather than 1 share per month, add as much as you can afford and continue to grow this contribution over time; Yes.

And then obviously as the price changes up or down, i invest that amount?; That’s totally fine and expected at 19, it was more of an overarching piece of advice as to not get caught up on doing X number of shares and get complacent, but as you continue to grow and earn more, bump up that monthly contribution as much as you can comfortably afford; If you’re on Wealthsimple you can set it up to do fixed $. You don’t have to buy a whole share at once, you can own fractions of it. Here’s the chat GPT explanation of why fixed $ is better: 

Investing a fixed dollar amount is generally better because it provides predictable investments and helps manage market fluctuations through dollar-cost averaging (DCA). With DCA, you invest the same amount regularly, buying more shares when prices are low and fewer when prices are high. This can lower your average cost per share over time and reduce the impact of market volatility. A fixed number of shares can lead to overbuying when prices are high and is harder to track for long-term goals."
Stocks Trading 101: My Guide to the Basics,"When I first started looking into stock trading, the sheer amount of jargon felt overwhelming. Over time, I realized that understanding these terms is half the battle. Here are some key concepts and terms that helped me make sense of it all.

Stock: A piece of ownership in a company.  
  
Share: One unit of stock or a slice of the company pie.  
  
Broker: The service or app that connects buyers and sellers; I’ve used platforms like Robinhood and TD Ameritrade to get started.

Bid Price: The most someone is willing to pay for a stock at that moment.

Ask Price: The lowest price someone is willing to sell for.

Spread: The gap between the bid and ask prices. Smaller spreads often mean more activity and easier trades.

Market Order: Buying or selling instantly at the current price.

Limit Order: Setting a specific price at which to buy or sell; I use this when I don’t want to pay more or accept less than a certain amount.

Stop Loss Order: Automatically sells to prevent big losses if the stock price drops too much.

Trailing Stop Order: Similar to a stop loss, but moves up with the stock price to lock in profits as the price rises.

Bull Market: When stock prices are generally going up.

Bear Market: When stock prices are falling.

Volatility: Measures how much stock prices go up and down, with higher volatility meaning bigger swings.

Liquidity: Refers to how easy it is to buy or sell a stock without affecting its price much. Stocks with high liquidity feel less stressful to trade.

Candlestick Chart: Shows price movements over a specific period with details on opening, closing, highest, and lowest prices.

Support Level: A price where a stock tends to stop falling and bounce back up.

Resistance Level: A price where a stock tends to stop rising and reverse.

Trend Line: Shows the general direction of a stock’s price.

Moving Average (MA): Smooths out price fluctuations to reveal trends more clearly.

Earnings Per Share (EPS): A company’s profit divided by the number of shares. Higher EPS usually indicates more profitability.

Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E): Shows how much investors are willing to pay for $1 of earnings. A high P/E could mean the stock is overvalued or reflect high growth expectations.

Dividends: Portions of profits paid out to shareholders, a nice bonus for holding the stock.

Market Cap: The total value of all a company’s shares combined. A useful way to compare company sizes.

Day Trading: Involves buying and selling within the same day. It’s fast-paced and demanding.

Swing Trading: Involves holding stocks for days or weeks to profit from short-term trends.

Long Position: Buying a stock and expecting the price to rise.

Short Position: Selling a stock you don’t own, hoping the price will drop so you can buy it back cheaper.

Risk-Reward Ratio: Balances potential losses and gains, with a 1:2 ratio meaning risking $1 to potentially make $2.

Diversification: Spreads investments across different stocks or sectors to reduce risk.

Leverage: Borrowing money to trade bigger, amplifying both gains and losses. I use it cautiously.

Margin: Money borrowed from a broker to buy stocks. Helpful but carries real risks.

S&P 500: Tracks 500 of the largest U.S. companies and is a good measure of the overall market.

Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA): Tracks 30 major companies and has a more traditional focus.

Nasdaq: Heavily tech-oriented, featuring companies like Apple, Tesla, and Amazon.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1hfts7a/stocks_trading_101_my_guide_to_the_basics/,26,2024-12-16 22:15:41,"This looks like a newbie/general question that we've covered in our [resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/wiki/index) - Have a look at the contents listed, it's updated weekly!

TSMC manufactures NVIDIA's chips, which are essential for NVIDIA’s GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) and other products. Since TSMC supplies these critical components, **over one-third of NVIDIA's production costs** go directly to TSMC.

**Ticker:** NVDA

**Direction:**  Potentially Down (depending on geopolitical stability)

**Prognosis:**  Nvidia's heavy reliance on TSMC for chip manufacturing (35.82% of COGS) presents a significant supply chain risk.  This could impact future profitability.

Optics run the AI machinery.; Undervalued, 500 eow; [removed]; AVGO is not a meme stock or hyped stock; even AMD had more hyped lasts year than what AVGO has now.

The ASIC has a real market. It won’t be as big as nvidia since nvidia provides the whole package of verticals integrated solution and able to sell to all kinds of companies including manufacturers, financial companies, government etc. 

AVGO customers are only these with enough money, solid software teams, demands for self-independent AI infrastructures.  Only a few of customers such as AWS, Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, meta, apple qualified. 

Engineers are working g their asses off build a better ecosystem that decouples Nvidia. The demand is real, but be careful with people who tell you that it gonna crush nvidia. They aren’t same and never expect it goes beyond nvidia.; Intel bro; Is avgo a buy?; It depends on what you're doing. ASICs are one-trick ponies, they're limited to running the one algorithm that's literally cut into their silicon. But because of that, they can run that one algorithm faster and more efficiently than a GPU ever can.

A GPU vs an ASIC is like a car that can drive anywhere at 70 MPH, vs a bullet train that just barrels down one rail line at 200 MPH. Do you need the versatility or do you need the speed.

Anyway, the ""tensor processing units"" that Google is ordering to run their chatbots are ASICs. I'm not familiar with the architecture, but they must feel good about their LLM model in order to pretty much lock it in.; The people who researched the comparison between the two are loading up on NVDA now; Seems good entry for a good pile and 135 target price.

"""Tesla's road to $2 trillion: Musk's bet on Trump fuels lofty analyst target""","""Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives on Sunday raised his price target on Tesla to $515 from $400, praising Elon Musk's ""bet for the ages"" on President-elect Donald Trump - a move Ives says could clear regulatory hurdles for the company's rollout of autonomous driving technology.

His view is nearly double Wall Street's average price target of $265.28, per LSEG. Ives also sees potential for more with a $650 bull case that could help Tesla hit $2 trillion in market value - a feat only achieved by a handful of companies including Apple , Microsoft and AI chip giant Nvidia .""

[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse); Analysts and especially dan fucking ives just wake up, check stock prices and then think of a story they will attach to the price target they just pulled out of their ass. ; Regarded analysts who just go where the wind is blowing. Assholes.; Corrupt as fuck. Calls it is.; 100% bearish on that ridiculously overvalued stock. But 0% balsy to fight the crowd and corruption and short it.; Removing regulatory hurdles isn’t going to magically make Tesla’s FSD work. It seems more likely to be a boon for Waymo. The all-vision solution that doesn’t rely on detailed maps seems like it’s always going to present a higher risk of major accidents than the multisensor/mapped approach. ; Dan Ives is such a fraud. His suits are also horrendous.; this is a pump. smart money has been in full control since last week it's a bull trap. it should correct in the near future.; Oh yea the regulators are the reason why Tesla FSD drove your family into a truck.; [deleted]; I won't do it because it's a crook and corrupted economy, but in a normal world, anybody shorting Tesla should become a millionnaire .

Absolutely nothing justifies this valuation.; Yeah cool it’s only been 8 years since I ordered my solar roof. Sure they’ll be ramping production soon.; Dan Ives is just tesla bull. An analyst can give whatever targets they want in a bull/bear markets and it would be out of touch to reality.; With its all time high, the main theme of trading TSLA is who's the seller? Same as all other all time high stock, its just that TSLA now holds probably the strongest reason not to sell, which is the close tie between its CEO and the president of the most powerful country in the world.

And if no body who hold the stock sell, there's no selling pressure, there for stock will not fall. It's really as simple as that.; A two trillion dollar car company.  My gosh, the top has to be close.; The biggest thing fueling this massive move is that people say, ""TSLA is way overvalued, I'm going to short it or buy puts.""


They are wrecking their accounts and getting margin called. L; Some people still think Tesla is a car company?; Welovebush Securities.; the question remains - will anyone. actually use this? and how many will actually allow their car to drive around and robotaxi whilst they’re at work, when they find out the car owner (not tesla) will be liable for any accidents while it’s driving itself around.; If y'all got polio you get some sick tesla robot crutches.; Doesn't make much sense to me. 

Just logically, we seem to all acknowledge the car business will be commoditized in the long run. Plenty of non-china allies will sell fantastic batteries to US companies (Panasonic & Samsung). So we dont think the margins coming from there. 

Waymo currently works and is valued at somewhere near 50b, and thats a recent fundraising round so its accurate. I just dont buy that the FSD is worth 1.5trillion dollars, and waymo is worth 50. Keep in mind next year Lidar for waymo will cost \~$800 in hardware, prices have been coming down fast. And Lidar does let you see things cameras don't. 

If Teslas most valuable asset is FSD, and the cost of recreating FSD is dropping exponentially (which it is since compute is growing exponentially) it just seems like a very difficult moat to keep. 

All i know is today i would let a waymo pick my kid up and to a friends, and theres not a chance in hell i'll feel comfortable doing that in a tesla for a bit.; Obviously there's no stopping Tesla now. It may never drop again.; Fellow regards, please short more tesla.

I beg of you.; $600 is probably low it pumps all year. Regulatory capture in a meme presidency; Cope bears, you're fucked.; Tesla is basically a bid on monarchy and not a car company anymore.; Chatgpt out with a revolutionary AI Chatbot and had 5 copycats just as good in 3 months. AI self driving is not gonna be some moat that tesla will control its gonna be replicated and perfected by multiple companies almost simultaneously and will be a gimmick not some trillion dollar industry. Hate this scam stock; Despite this discussion, does anyone know if Elon will use Tesla for his AI to compete with Chat GPT, or will he use another entity?; For fucks sake just write ""bribe for the ages"" so we can have an honest discussion


(Long TSLA); Ill still be here for when it crash. Buy the rumour sell the news; As someone who has been following Tesla for a long time, most people here are just bitter they’ve missed the runs and probably dislike Elon and his companies solely because of his politics. FSD works great and continues to make dramatic improvements year over year. Tesla has so much more going than just being a car company and once the majority of people wake up to that, they will begin to see the valuation is justified; I think one analyst has a hard on for pumping the market to unrealistic prices.; Tsla is my first 10 bagger.  Put $4k in back in 2019.   

Buy and hold wins every time degens!; They sell 1.13% of cars in the US.; Yeah probably I don’t know 

I think it’s all inevitable and that the current data suggests it should be allowed if not mandated.; Dan ""Let's pound the table"" Ives is a colorful anal-ist who knows nothing; He will get there, imo even the first to be 10t doesn't seem impossible anymore. It makes no sense, but i guess that's elons thing.


Love it ; Betting on government corruption and preferential treatment is sick af!; It's a worthless meme stock, no connection to the Tesla company at all at these valuations. You could just as well buy Doge coin and pretend that this is a share of the Tesla company. So, I added some shorts today at around $450.; What goes up must come down.

Just need to figure out when ...; Tesla's FSD tech gonna print harder than JPow. [Their internal data shows FSD will beat human drivers by Q2 2025](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-poised-2-trillion-market-165634504.html). Not even close. Straight facts. 

Energy storage revenue already up 52% YOY. Megapack and Powerwall deployments going brrrr.

Yes, getting rid of the EV credit will hurt TSLA’s competitors more than it will them, but non-Tesla EV sales are already in the gutter, and always have been. Their gap appeared to have shrunk in recent quarters, which may very likely be due to Elon’s personal behavior having ostracized people that were previously buying Teslas. 

Removing the EV credit will still make Tesla’s more expensive for consumers.

So Tesla will increase their already dominant share of EV sales, but the overall volume of those EVs will also shrink. 

If 50 out of every 100 EV sales being a Tesla shifts to 40 out of every 70 EV sales being a Tesla, how does that equal another trillion in market cap?; Indeed . Am buying in soon; Welcome to the dark side. And I don’t just mean Tesla.; The risk of Elon being jailed for corruption is priced in, I guess.; Corruption knows no sides. Both sides are equally corrupt.

Money is money. Calls it is.; I’m that balsy. Down 29.31% rn.; Exactly how I feel. I’m thinking of testing the waters a bit though. The rally is unbelievable; Musk has a ton of influence over Trump right now, I assumed that was a major cause of his recent massive increase in net worth. The Trump administration (or any administration) can make specific rules/carve outs that specifically benefit one company, (I.e special federal tax benefits for Texas based EV car companies, converting the federal car fleet to EVs with the contract going to Tesla, all federal offices converting to solar with Tesla winning the contract, etc.) 

I think that’s the play here. A very wealthy and powerful businessman is tied at the hip to the incoming administration who is known to be especially kind to those close to him personally…. It would make sense to bet Tesla is going to get increase business. And honestly, I’m thinking there might be a point when conservatives start buying Teslas just bc they associate Musk with Trump (sort of like the My Pillow Guy, All my Trump supporting relatives own a My Pillow).; Can't wait for right wingers to be for tort reform again. We're probably overdue for that news cycle. These corporations won't want to be responsible for any crashes, and the right wing will make sure that is the case.; Legit question. I have seen so many videos of FSD, most of them in cities granted. But it seems to work extremely well. So when people say FSD sucks do they just mean outside of well mapped areas? Seems like the easy solution is making it only work in certain areas.; As long as your solution is better than humans I don‘t see the problem. It is funny how people accept car accidents caused by humans, but go wild when AI makes a mistake (far less). ; Remind me in 5 years.

Energy storage, FSD v13, Optimus and the confluence of tech leading to rapid advancements in the area of humanoid robotics, DOJO and cortex, the economics of an autonous robotaxi network... calling Tesla a car company is like calling Amazon a bookstore; This is a quote out of a press interview!; No one is arguing that.  What are are arguing is generally speaking,  stocks do not go up like that vertically day after day.

If people would look at what analysts said in the past and not only what they say about the future, analysts would be out of their job.; He is not much better than a coin flip tho although that is what most analysts have.

[https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/daniel-ives](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/daniel-ives); Maybe because it's wind from an asshole? 😁🤷🏻‍♂️; Oh yeah?  He's stupid.; The thesis is that corruption is out in the open and the American voters are in on it. Elon will get whatever he wants. So will Peter Thiel. 

Not financial advise.; 2024 unit sales will be flat at best and it doesn’t matter. If it wasn’t for BS leases to move units the comp would be negative.; My understanding is they will remove nhsta crash data and let them just start using their autonomous driving even if it’s completely shit. On the other side they seem to make money from selling regulatory credits if I’m not mistaken and cyber truck sales data is not good; Yeah I see more upside for TSLA in other recent news, such as the downfall of VW, or GM giving up on Cruise. I think the election is bullish in that it removes the previous administration which was hostile to TSLA, but beyond that I don't see the concrete benefits. There are even bad aspects like Elon being distracted by DOGE and getting the company even more embroiled in partisan politics.; Look in 4 years when another government comes in and wants electric vehicles and pushes for cleaner world. Tesla would be an even bigger giant as ford/GM will be even further. Have to look at the bigger picture.; Overall volume of EV’s will never shrink. They are the future.  EV technology is still in its infancy.  Gasoline cars will shrink until they’re all but gone from consumer use. Diesel will stick around for quite a while in commercial use, but 90% of the cars on the road will be electric in 25 years.  

Pulling the ladder up from under them will give Tesla a massive advantage for years to come.  Tesla is one of the only manufacturers selling their vehicles at a profit.  Nearly every legacy manufacturer and every startup is still selling their EV’s at a loss in the US.  As ICE market share dies, so will legacy auto.  The only ones who can compete and probably do it at a better price point are NIO and maybe Xpeng, who guess what, are going to be hit with huge tariffs if they ever want to sell in the US. 

Tesla cars in the US are going to be as ubiquitous as iPhones.  In 5-10 years we could start seeing 7-8m Tesla’s sold in the US annually.; Irrationality adds up quick; Considering buying puts. Throwing money out of the windows seems safer than shorting/shorting calls; I look at all the posts of people who have tried.  I definitely wouldn't touch it either way until the inauguration at a bare minimum.  I wasn't expecting another 8-10% today ; This exactly. If Elon has a seat at the table at the top of government, Tesla becomes impossible to value once you price in self-dealing.

Of course, if he gets sent to the kids table some of that evaporates.

It's a wildly speculative... (*checks notes*) $1.5T company?; TX folks aint buying green cars; Wow, it's blatant corruption. 

Just route people's taxes to musk's bank account. This can eliminate lots of government employees, DOGE!; You mean like the pharma industry wasn‘t responsible for any side effects under the corrupt left wing regiment in covid years? You mean this type of corruption? Right?; It does most things well and some things extremely poorly. Unfortunately for driving one split-second mistake can absolutely ruin your day.


* Sometimes it doesn't let people merge over, ruining a zipper merge.
* It struggles to see in the dark.
* It doesn't respect bus only or turn only lanes.
* If Tesla nav messes up, it's going to follow bad directions like getting off the highway only to get on again.
* It frequently stops about a second too late and slams the brakes like it didn't see a light.
* Sometimes it just guns the acceleration in stop/go traffic, again resulting in a harsh ride.
* Sometimes it takes turns just a little too fast.


Anyway, lots more but yeah as someone who uses it a lot FSD still has a long way to go.; WSJ (2 days ago): [The Hidden Autopilot Data That Reveals Why Teslas Crash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPUGh0qAqWA)

Level 2 and 3 autonomous driving encourages complacency, which means the drivers are surprised (and sometimes, killed) with the systems fail. 

Humans remain far better at rotating objects in our mind, like overturned trucks or T intersections, than any machine learning system. And our eyes are much more sensitive than cameras, particularly at night.

Selling a semi-autonomous vehicle without LIDAR should be regarded as criminal fraud.

And aside from that video, the duration of uninterrupted drives with FSD isn't growing particularly fast. I'd expect viable consumer systems perhaps in the late 2030s. We'll know they've arrived when insurers offer discounts for drivers that routinely use FSD. At present, high insurance rates are one of the drivers behind high ownership costs for Teslas.; It works well until it doesn't.

Any tech that does most of the job for you but requires you to supervise isn't going to work at scale. People will get bored and naturally quit paying attention (or even fall asleep), and in a speeding car you really can't do that.

There are hundreds of videos of Tesla's driving into clearly marked obstacles, like a fallen semi trailer or pulled over police cruiser with emergency lights on (or even small children), because the AI hasn't had training with that exact shape before so would drive full speed into it. Too many people have died this way to say it works extremely well.; Because you are sitting there supervising it and taking all the risk financially when it doesn’t work.  You might as well drive.; I think it gets down to a combination things:  the error rate, the severity of an error, and the scale of operation. If a human has to pump the brakes once to avoid a collision in ten hours of driving, then that's a very low error rate and an amazing technical feat. You could make all kinds of youtube videos about how incredible it is. And it truly is incredible. Our family had a rotary phone when I was a child, and now we are living in the future.

But that means in the absence of a human in the loop, there would be one accident for every 10 hours of road time.

So what if Tesla gets that down to one accident-avoiding active intervention per 1,000 hours of drive time? Even more incredible.

But if there are a thousand Teslas operating autonomously, then that's one accident per hour. There are a heck of a lot more than a thousand Teslas in operation, so consider what kind of an error rate they need to have to avoid causing a newsworthy accident every single day. And remember these can be life-altering or life-ending. The stakes are high.

Tesla fans rave about all the miles of driving data they have, but the bulk of those miles are probably driving in a straight line staying between painted lane markings and behind the car in front. It's the edge cases and weird things that need to be dealt with. You need lots of redundency. You need lots of guardrails. You need maps and lots of sensors and different kinds of sensors to get the insanely low error rates needed to operate at scale without killing people on a regular basis.

Waymo is out there doing now what Tesla has been talking about doing for years. My gut tells me that waymo's accident rate is going to be well below Tesla's if they both go head-to-head in the robotaxi market. Even if both are below the accident rate of a human, I expect Tesla's rate will be higher  because of the technical roadmap they adopted (vision only, operate without detailed mapping). I will wait an extra few minutes for a Waymo.; Most people have no idea. They just hate Elon, click on every headline that says Musk or Tesla and repeat the nonsense other Elon haters told them. I guess this is the swarm intelligence everybody talks about. Lol. ; There's not really any mapping for FSD. It works everywhere. However, sometimes there are some disagreements between the navigation based on Google Maps and FSD, which they seem to be getting under control better lately. Perhaps they will create their own navigation system based on all the driving data they get. The goal for Tesla is to tackle the specific scenarios in which FSD makes mistakes, which seems to be getting exponentially smaller. 

Although Waymo is currently ahead of Tesla, it has a scaling problem, and it's just as (or more) expensive as an Uber. Tesla robotaxi should be much cheaper, and can work all over the US from one day to the other with a software update.; No I'm totally down for TSLA because there will be tangible value. Right now it's trading like crypto; What exactly do you mean by ""next election""?; He'll probably back Warren Jeff's candidacy to legalize polygamy and be announced a prophet by the state church.; From your lips to god’s ear’s 🙏 

😂; If TSLA could displace a significant portion of truckers in the US with autonomous navigators making those truckers full salary, their valuation still wouldn't be justified.

There is no value proposition, it is just momentum, Elon, and FOMO. Over thanksgiving people who did not even know how to use their brokerage app were asking me for help buying TSLA shares.; What a fanboi; How many of these are pet projects that generate no revenue?; Then why does everyone only care about the number of cars sold when they do ERs?; [removed]; The numbers I see say Tesla is down to 48% of the electric market share in the US.

They are down in sales 4.3% in China year over year. We have likely seen speak Tesla sales in China as cheap Chinese EVs begin to dominate their market.; No, Trump has burned literally every everybody he’s ever worked with. He operates on infinite grift. We literally have no fucking clue what will happen.

His job is to justify nosebleed prices to the dumb money, to provide the smart money with exit liquidity.; Ok he's stoopid bet u can't say he's not rich 💵; Reminder that 4 years is not much time in finance. To get to 1 trillion valuation for TSLA we have to assume years of earnings growth, then decades of discounted cashflows adding up. If ""corruption"" alone can significantly increase the value of the firm, we have to see specific favors FAST (Trump wont be here forever), and they must not be offset by some political disaster 5 years down the line (we're looking for cashflows over 30+ year timespans, not just for the next 4 years).; Maybe, but evaluations rn are still complete nonsense. Do u realize that Tesla’s evaluation increased by 2.5 times ford’s entire market cap just on today’s gains ; Only in the USA though. Nobody else will buy Teslas when they can have a better and cheaper BYD.; Texas is already the country’s leader in wind energy and if it was a country would be in the top 10 for wind production…. Despite all the conservative bitching about renewables and wind. So I wouldn’t write off Texas for EVs; Well, I, for one, would NEVER hope you get hit by a bus.

FSD will never truly work unless they get to 50+ megapixel sensors with ability to get high quality low light and same cognitive capability as humans do. The fact that tesla claims they can put this on existing cars and even older models are fraudulent. this is the cost of not adding more sensors. stupid decisions all for greed and narcissistic arrogance.; Humans have problems in other areas though which evens things out.

So you're telling me if they captured 500B/year in revenue from trucking industry their valuation at 1.5T wouldn't be justified? Come on man.; what an intelligent response; Energy storage and FSD generate revenue and FSD is rapidly improving. Everything starts out as a project that generates no revenue though. I encourage you to go to youtube and watch videos of FSD v13.2. Do your own research and make up your own mind; because wall street has historically always lagged behind on revolutionary tech and a lot of the people that cover Tesla are auto analysts and have no understanding of it. Go back and look at what they were saying when Apple released the iPhone, or about Amazon and AWS, or NVIDIA when anybody that was paying attention could see the AI transition that was taking place but Nvidia was nothing more than a gaming company until that big quarter where it finally showed up in revenues.

Don't take my word for it though. Look over the last 4 quarters of earnings and listen to the conference calls. Look at how rapidly energy storage is growing and they just completed another megapack factory in China that's gonna start shipping units in Q1 next year. Go to youtube and watch videos of FSD v13.2 and Optimus. Research the other robotics companies like FigureAI and look who's investing in them. Run the thought experiments in your head about what it really means if a $30,000 car can drive itself. How it changes travel, how cars are designed and the massive productivity increase that follows.

Anyway, I could go on and on but my point is, don't listen to me or any of the other idiots on here. Do your own research and think for yourself; yeah,  I want nothing to do with it.; Ah.

 The TAM for global autonomous vehicle transport of goods and people could be in the several trillion dollar range.  Tesla is the only serious competitor today. Will they succeed? I don't know! But I think it is certainly enough to justify the current valuation.; Selling the trucks and offering autonomous driving as a service is just a part of the autonomous trucking market... 600 billion would require owning and operating the fleet as well as the distribution network... And I haven't heard anything yet about them becoming a logistics company.

In Q3 2023 I began reallocating into AI-related stocks when I developed strong conviction. I'm also working on a self-funded AI startup, which keeps me in the loop on AI.

Returns have been strong and continue to give me the runway to work on my startup and support my family after leaving my corporate tech job. There's more context in my previous updates linked below.

(*\*) Short term capital gain/loss held for <1yr*

I held several companies (\*) for a short time to spread out my AI bets, but some of the increasingly high P/E ratios concerned me (PLTR, TSLA, etc.).

So, I sold them and purchased more NVIDIA. This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects.

In this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off.

To clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change.

Meta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation.

# Unrealized (current investments)

* **Meta (META):** \+367.97%
* **Nvidia (NVDA):** \+117.05%

Nvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up \~200% since I initially purchased it last year after dithering for months.

These returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it.

# Rate of return (IRR)

My annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is **73.6%**.

# Investment thesis

See a summary of my investment thesis in a [previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/). **TL;DR:**

>“…AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways.

>The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the \~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among [other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/).”

# Nvidia's dominance

I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:

* Nvidia is [founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/) and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.
* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.
* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.
* AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).
* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.

# We still underestimate the AI opportunity

Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.

We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.

# Final thoughts

I'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/) I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from.

I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.

**UPDATE:** Thanks for mentioning I should have included indexes for benchmark context. Indexes like QQQ and S&P 500 also had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024). For an apples to apples comparison, the IRR of QQQ and S&P 500 respectively during this period were \~24% and \~16%.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hfjvh8/25_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/,832,2024-12-16 15:08:16,"What data points make you think AI has more to offer than incremental improvements over where we are at today?; For whatever reason i decided to put everything into Peloton around that time.

Needless to say I dont buy stocks anymore; Lol this is insane performance, but half the comments are on your ass because they don’t get the difference between annualized and cumulative return; My total rate of return for 2022 to 2024 is 96% doing nothing but buying QQQ; For reference the S&P was up 58% in the same period (w/dividends reinvested), with near zero tax consequences.

Edit: Since it needs to be clarified… the reference is to express how buy and hold would have preformed. It’s not right or wrong, it’s a reference point.; Now you need to calculate the taxes you had to pay doing this trading and calculate your total return.
Investing is about your total return after everything including taxes.; Great play. I’m sure you outperformed the market by a ton during this regardless of taxes. What made you want to sell some of your big winners? What do you think of Reddit stock right now?; Quick question on Nvidia. A lot of the hyperscalers (e.g. Amazon) have mentioned their own ambitions to build their own GPUs. These hyperscalers also happen to be big cutsomers of Nvidia. What are your thoughts on hyperscalers developing their own hardware and competing with Nvidia? Congrats on your results btw. A lot of good names in the portfolio; You sold GOOGL & AMZN? Why?; I share your sentiment on $NVDA. I’m in tech, both as a founder of several businesses and investor. Almost every startup I see is doing something with AI and all the large mega-businesses are too. 

Granted there is some absolute non-sense happening with investments and startups, but AI is going to revolutionize everything we do. 

I’m in other non-AI investments but my AI strategy is to invest on the hardware side (NVDA, TSM, SOXL and even some AMD) and on the content side (RDDT). AI is driven by human content and Reddit is the greatest source of that right now.; If it takes off, I’ll get it from the index.  Less risky that way.  I made a 40% return on single stocks then diversified because the odds were not on my side that I could keep it up.; > Below are the returns for this portfolio (opened in 2022) as of December 2024.

> Carvana (CVNA): +845.57%

Would you mind sharing how you got +845% if you acquired in 2022 and sold in 2023? Looking at the performance, CVNA was high but on its was down in 2022, and did not recover significantly until 2024.; This is the best post! Thanks for the transparency. Forgot about peloton. Rip Covid wave; You must be one of the few that made money selling Unity.... Only booking a small loss on Snapchat is good as well, one of my worst investments.; I’d say we’re actually wildly overestimating AI.; That’s not an “investing thesis”. That was gambling and it sometimes works. Right now you are in the Dunning-Kruger effect zone.; Looking at some of these and I think ""damn, I shouldn't have got nervous. I should have bought some of these like Meta and amazon and Netflix"".; I'm bullish for chips/semi-conductors.

Nearly every piece of technology that's not a calculator will be running on these materials and technology will only get more complex and dynamic. 

Think of the future in 15-20 years, are we going to see less or more?

More. A Lot more.; Congrats! Great job.

Thoughts on ASML?; I would highly recommend to wait until our President is in office and the tariffs are in place along with the mass deportations.  This could highly cause the market to correct 

I’m my opinion, majority of the stocks have very high pe’s that are not justified Not worth buying right now. 

Need a major correction the stock’s values!!!!!!!!; Taking on additional risk can amplify returns in a bull market and losses in a bear market.  Getting higher returns is impressive, unless it's done via outsized risk.  Do you quantify risk in your portfolio?  How do you assess your risk?; just for comparison, S&P 500 on June 1 2022 was 3899 and today its 6063.79 so that's 

6063.79/3899^(1/[2+6.5/12])=1.19 which means an annualized 19% ROI over the same period. So like 1/3 of the OP

While not as powerful as nvdas top tier, they're like half the cost of their NVDA comparisons. In your opinion does this not eat into their most?

Microstrategy has outperformed everything, including Nvidia, at every time frame, and this gap will only widen in the coming 12 months.; That’s not a lot! I make that in a day; This is interesting I will look into it; The answer to that question is overdetermined and IMO easier to answer the other way. The 'ChatGPT moment' when AI entered the public consciousness and investment meaningfully increased was \~2 years ago.

Given past technological advancements, do we think we're near the end of what possible after two years or the beginning?

That's where I'd start. Working in the industry, talking to folks and watching what others are building reinforces this. For example, just about every scientist and research I've talking to is excited because we're just scratching the surface of what's possible.

For consumer examples, look at the videos Sora is creating (I recently got access to it). It has a long way to go, but I can imagine the possibilities. For example, imagine coming home and wanting to watch a new sequel of <your favorite franchise here>, but on a different timeline/scenario and just asking AI to generate it. How much would you pay for that? What about for a custom, fully immersive VR video game?

And that's just the world of bits. Move to the world of atoms and imagine robots trained to fix/build anything and do anything around the home, to train you how to improve your swing, etc. What if you could learn anything with a dedicated tutor? That's all possible with AI. How much economic value is that in the US and around the world?

I use it multiple times a day, every day. It's great, but still has a lot to improve on even in the scope of daily life. But as it becomes better, faster and cheaper it'll increase by orders of magnitude in usefulness.; Well we don't have: 

* Ambient Intelligence (AI in the Air)
* AI-Powered Molecular Fabrication (AI for Instant Objects)
* AI-Driven Health Guardians
* AI-Enhanced Education
* Biological Integration (AI in our Bodies)

Machine Learning & AI as it exists today is an infant. It is way too rough around the edges to use in real big business, in high leverage situations, especially with regulations in place.; The acceleration of AI is just beginning, and the pace is off the charts. It may appear as though it has slowed down, but that’s because the next area of focus is adding reasoning to LLMs and robotics.

I think we will see a breakthrough in Tesla for full self-driving cars where you can just sleep to your next destination. That’s a big deal and would change everything once that’s widespread. AI robots in the workplace will also become a reality soon. And can you imagine what quantum computing will do for all of this? 

Companies would not be pouring BILLIONS into AI if they didn’t expect a return on their investment. We *always* hit limits on technology and slow down… and then we break through.; Point of clarification - we have Generative AI, which is not actual AI. The difference is massive.; I was briefly optimistic about them too, but thankfully didn’t buy much. Did the same with Carvana and hit the lottery so 🤷‍♂️ Just shows how much is luck at times.; Honestly you deserve it for not diversifying and looking for a Hail Mary. Stay away from the market if thats your relationship with it. Or. Start buying Etfs now and future you will thank you immensely.; My gme is about to pop off!; You did it wrong. I bought at IPO and made ~$27k on a $5k investment. Sold at exactly the one year mark for long term gains.; Heh thanks. It’s always something it seems. It amuses me to look at other negative comments on my past update posts over the last couple years.

This series originally started from a comment on hacker news in 2022, so you can imagine how that went 😆; His is annual lol i swear you people dint read; Mag7 have done super well over that time period, so yeah. 

But OP had 73 percent annual return for each of the 2.5 years, which is a lot higher than 96 percent.; This. Bro is out here with a manifesto during/after a crazy bull run where you can pretty much buy anything and isn't even outperforming the index.; Yes, indexes like QQQ and S&P 500 had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024), but what you shared isn't IRR. For apples to apples, the IRR of QQQ and S&P 500 respectively during this period were \~16% and \~24%.; Watch the vocal minority of this sub that worships VOO cry at this comment; Check out TQQQ; > My total rate of return for 2022 to 2024 is 96% doing nothing but buying QQQ

Nice story. He did way better than you. Can you read?; Literally same here. With $SPY as well!; No, the IRR (annualized rate of return) of the S&P 500 during the same was closer to 16%.

But you're right, a benchmark for comparison would be be helpful, so I added it in an update at the bottom. Thank you for the callout.; Yeah I’d be curious how this plays out when you look at net position post taxes. (Which is all that really matters).

 Looks like OP exposed themselves to a lot of extra risk over something boring like CDA into an index fund, for relatively minimal additional benefit. ; Annually, or total?; How are taxes different for SPY?; Quote annual if op is quoting annual; > For reference the S&P was up 58% in the same period (w/dividends reinvested), with near zero tax consequences.

Also for reference, snow is white.; This; Thank you!

>What made you want to sell some of your big winners?

Things felt overvalued after the post-election rally. Nvidia and Meta had the most attractive valuations relative to their market positions (especially if there's a correction) as well as the most long-term upside, so I held them.

Plus feeling they were overvalued was just nagging in the back of my mind, so pulling the trigger to sell them also freed up some mental cycles, which is valuable in itself.

I still believe in most of those companies (especially Tesla, Palantir, etc.) but the relative valuation just felt high.

I'll certainly miss some short-term upside, but I'm hoping to make up for it long-term.

>What do you think of Reddit stock right now?

Sorry, I don't have an opinion on it since it's not in my area of expertise. I've learned (the hard way) to only invest in what I know deeply, thus where I have an advantage.; Yeah, I have questions there too. Amazon for example now has their Trainum 2 chips in GA promising better price performance, whith Trainium 3 chips coming next summer. This will cut into Nvidia's market share at the low end, as AWS' goal is always to commoditize infra. Google also has its own TPUs it uses.

But they and all other hyperscalers still use Nvidia's GPUs as well due to the unmatched versatility and ecosystem. Where the balance settles is still a big question.

The more negative case for Nvidia is if somehow we reach the limits GPU scaling on all fronts (e.g. even o1's economics don't scale, which is unlikely), in which case GPUs become more commoditized to the extent that the other aspects of their moat (CUDA, ecosystem, networking, etc.) can't make up for it.

However, I don't think that is the case. I'm also curious how large sovereign AI becomes in the coming years.

Long-term I'd expect Nvidia's market share to settle around \~70% (from \~90% today for datacenter AI GPUs). But even if competitors catch up and it drops to 50% I believe the market will be massive enough to achieve attractive returns.; * **GOOGL:** Relatively slow growth, relatively unexciting near term prospects, search cash cow threatened by Open AI and others.
* **AMZN:** P/E is about the same as NVDA with much less growth.

To be clear, I'm optimistic about the long-term prospects for both companies, but I opted to double down where I had the most conviction and anticipated the most upside.; I agree. I still feel like we've yet to deep though and there may well be a short-term bust as the superficial ones wash out.

But building applications myself, talking to scientists, etc. it's incredible just how many more ways there  are to use it that'll be immensely beneficial. It'll just take time since the world also has to reconfigure around these things, just how the world reconfigured for roads and automobiles, electricity, the internet, etc.

What gives me hope is the awareness around AI since the public and government seem increasingly excited about it, which seems to be overcoming the initial fear -- at least to the extent the government understands it can't outlaw it and much embrace it to be competitive.; I had to look it up. Bought CVNA 12/14/2022 and sold 9/11/2023.

I hadn't looked at it since I sold, but looking now I missed out on a **ton** of upside. However, I was focused on the short-term recovery, not the longer term business prospects since that business isn't my wheelhouse and I had more conviction in AI, so reallocated into Nvidia. You win some you lose some I guess.; We shall see. Maybe possible in the short-term, but unlikely long-term.; I've been reading Stratechery, a tech/business analyst for almost a decade, which I credit for building my understanding of the industry. He has really strong analysis that helped me see through the market noise (voting machine vs. weighing machine) and make clear headed investment decisions on those.

My biggest regret is not following through on buying Nvidia in late 2022 at its bottom before the AI boom after he [analyzed its prospects](https://stratechery.com/2022/nvidia-in-the-valley/). This is after I had already went all-in on the pandemic stocks, thus didn't have a lot of extra cash at the time. About a year later is when I started selling the pandemic stocks to buy Nvidia and other AI stocks.

What I love most about his analysis is that he's not a stock picker, which keeps his analysis clear and unbiased. He just analyses the companies in the context of the industry and gives his analysis. He has a genuine love for the industry and analysis, which makes ability unmatched.; QQQM; ehm
Calculators in fact do run on semiconductors, too.; Not for me. Stratechery had a great summary on it. A quote from his article [TSMC Earnings, Margins and Arizona, ASML and Peak Lithography](https://stratechery.com/2024/tsmc-earnings-margins-and-arizona-asml-and-peak-lithography/):

>That leaves TSMC and its upcoming investment at 2nm and 16A, which is a challenge for ASML for three reasons. First, there is the aforementioned shift in TSMC’s model; repurposing equipment likely means fewer lithography orders. Second, while ASML may have a monopoly on advanced lithography, TSMC is poised to have monopsony power in terms of being able to actually make money on processes that utilize ASML’s advanced lithography, which may depress prices (this is the third factor that could help TSMC’s margins). The third challenge is that we are past peak lithography.

From Doug O’Laughlin at [Fabricated Knowledge](https://www.fabricatedknowledge.com/p/earnings-tsmc-asml-aehr-telecom):

>Another way to interrupt this statement is that EUV intensity is peaked if they think the DUV attach rate is growing as fast as EUV. This has been a long time coming, and Applied Materials puts it well in this slide – 3nm is the apex of lithography market share gains. This is not good for ASML and the EUV story.

>...

>The last decade has been the decade of Lithography, and I can almost assure you that Lithography spending will grow slower in the next decade than WFE \[Wafer Fab Equipment\]. And let’s not forget that in the decade before EUV, lithography was only 15-20% of the expenditure. I believe that lithography will revert to the mid-20s of WFE.

>I think it’s time for investors to accept the decade of lithography is over. The premium ASML has slowly gained for itself for the last decade should end as the decade of litho ends. And the recent price move has been a collapse of that premium. I believe it should trade in line with other semi-cap companies, as I’m sure that Litho will not outgrow WFE but will be valued for its strong monopoly.

It's still continue to be a good business, but not a great one that is likely to produce outsized returns.; Similar to how stocks sharply rose after the years of inflation, whatever the tariffs do will also increase the stocks eventually. Increase in revenue due to more expensive items will increase the stocks eventually price.; I agree. I trust my gut and don't do any kind of sophisticated analysis around balancing risk. I try to focus on overall fundamentals and long-term trends.

It's also why in the update I felt the need to say I'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. I could be that guy who jumps off a building and halfway down says, ""So far, so good!"" 🫠; Nice catch, I accidentally swapped the respective returns for S&P 500 and QQQ, just fixed it. I asked ChatGPT to calculate it since I was rushing trying to respond to most comments -- getting sloppy. Thank you for catching that.; I'm holding the ones I have the most conviction in given the current valuation. Though, I believe the Mag7 and tech generally will continue to grow long-term.; Nope, still bullish on them, just saw more upside elsewhere.; * **GOOGL:** Relatively slow growth, relatively unexciting near term prospects, search cash cow threatened by Open AI and others. That was my reasoning, though Willow and their new AI video gen model came out since then and may have changed my mind.
* **AMZN:** P/E is about the same as NVDA with much less growth.

To be clear, I'm optimistic about the long-term prospects for both companies, but I opted to double down where I had the most conviction and anticipated the most upside.; I think the two big questions are 1) does Intel even have a future and 2) why would anyone buy from Intel?

I don't mean that in a snarky way, but I have legitimate concerns about their future. And those concerns would make would-be chip buyers less likely to invest in chips from them.

Assuming Intel does come out strong, I'm curious how attractive their chips would be compared to 1) hyperscalers like Amazon making their own chips and 2) alternatives like AMD for everyone else.

In terms of desirability, how I see it playing out is those who prioritize training would want the most powerful GPUs for training, then rotate those to inference as they get replaced by better GPUs.

As long as Nvidia is supply constrained, there will be room for competitors. And there will increasingly be demand for more efficient, low powered inference.

So IMO the first question is whether Intel remains viable. Then if they do, how attractive are they to everyone who isn't building their own chips and for what purpose -- as a designer? A fab?

As long as their current board is in place, I don't see much changing for them since in terms of expertise Pat Gelsinger was the best shot they had.

The sad thing about this is if you look at most of the historical innovation in terms of processes, Intel led the way there and TSMC followed. So if Intel dies, I don't know who will pick up the torch. Intel was quite amazing, just a tragedy how they fell.; Not likely. Nvidia has >80% market share and nobody else is even close. Betting on anyone else would be diluting returns IMO.

However I’m looking and fundamentals and qualitative factors. The market is often based on other speculative factors, judging by the valuations of others so I’m not saying it won’t happen short term, just that I wouldn’t bet on it based on what I see.; >You could have achieved a similar return by levering a diversified index

Interesting. Which index achieved a \~70% annual rate of return during that period?

>Ride out a down market with those same stocks and let us know if you’re still outperforming.

Why? My goal is to buy low and sell high. I intentionally bought them at the bottom of the down market. Why would I buy stocks and ride out a down market?

I covered it in a previous update, but prior to the pandemic dip I was largely in cash beginning in late 2021 anticipating a drop. I did the same thing with the '08/'09 recession (in my 20's), though I was more heavily in depressed real estate in addition to stocks.

I go where the opportunities are and that's why I'm all in on AI now. I don't consider it gabling though, I have generally have deep knowledge about what I invest in (in addition to a MS in Finance and an MBA).

Will I always be right? No, but I share transparent updates here and enjoy the feedback and interaction. BTW I really would love to here about the index you're referring to with the \~70% annual return you mentioned.; In late 2021 there were rumblings of billionaire unloading assets, fed policy shifts and increasing inflation. Plus it just felt generally unsustainable since it wasn't clear anything sustainable was driving it. I also listen to a lot of VCs and other investors, who felt the same thing, but stayed in because they were still making money.

Timing the market is hard and I generally don't do it. Even in this case I didn't time it all that well:

1. I was first in indexes, then in cash before the drop so I definitely missed out on some upside.
2. It was 7 months of ups and down (mostly down) until I was consistently in the green. I'd be lying if I said I didn't question my decisions during that time, but I kept buying more companies as they bottomed out if they had good fundamentals (with a few exceptions, which were a mixed back, but up overall).

I think the hardest part of investing is understanding your own psychology enough to have the right discipline. If you can do that, then it's easier to take in a lot of data sources, ignore the noise (see most comments here and talking heads on TV), and make your own decisions.

It also helps that I learned lessons and built discipline, patience and instincts during the last recession. With this one I didn't invest more than I could afford to lose. And as my returns grew, I could invest more since I was just risking my returns.

Lastly, I also knew I was investing for the long-term, which allowed me to be patient and not worry about short-term movements. I still watch the market every day out of interest, but don't trade all that much because long-term trends changes and meaningful new information don't happen that often.

Lastly, the only way to outperform the market is to be contrarian and right. So by definition, you have to ignore what most people are saying, but also have enough judgement to know if you're informed enough to do that. There's also no doubt luck plays a big factor in many aspects.; 😆; Very nice. I know nothing about Microstrategy so for me it’d be gambling. I stick to what I know deeply for alpha.; I work at the #1 cloud provider in the AI industry with leading AI research firms and I think we are hitting the limits of the transformer architecture. New model benchmarks (e.g., Amazon Nova) are providing marginal improvements at best while pre-training and fine tuning costs remain very high (multiple millions for just fine-tuning). The underlying technical limitation of the architecture will limit the apps built on top (video gen, autonomous agents, etc.). If all the economy gets for this investment are copilots and customer service chatbots, then that is valuable but not a game-changer.; Have a look at the Gartner hype cycle. That's what tends to happen with new areas and often also the related stocks.

I'm not saying there _isn't_ a market for this, but I wouldn't pay anything for that.


Honestly, I'm kind of disappointed in your answer. It doesn't actually answer the question you were asked.


You provided no data points to suggest there are more than incremental updates remaining.

This is literally the opposite of a data point.; > For example, imagine coming home and wanting to watch a new sequel of <your favorite franchise here>, but on a different timeline/scenario and just asking AI to generate it. How much would you pay for that?


I can't tell you how awful this sounds. The end of endings is a change in thinking I'm not sure people are ready for or need.


Like, the MCU multiverse arc is garbage. If anything is possible, nothing matters. Character is dead? They're alive again with zero effort. I am checked out of that series because there is no emotional investment. Why would I bother to watch something that has no ending? I am watching it to find out _how it ends_. I want satisfaction. Or dissatisfaction. Some finality.

The fact that this comment has 159 upvotes makes this subreddit seem pretty idiotic and jealous; And what was yours annualized?

What signal will change your mind on Nvda and Meta?; Taxes were relatively small, particularly because most of my sales qualified for long-term capital gains.

Maybe I misunderstand what you mean by 'relatively minimal additional benefit'. An annualized return of over 70% is 3X-5X what indexes like S&P 500 and Nasdaq earned during that same period.; Total… same period of time in question.

I only mention this because the figures being presented need a comparison to something with market risk.

I agree with your thinking and am considering selling some winners (including Reddit) myself right now.

I don’t think anyone really knows how any of this works.  You could describe in terms matrix algebra/calculus description but that doesn’t really explain why it works. A new architecture or breakthrough will come along that speeds development, training, something else who knows, it consistently has.  It was the transformer with RLHF that had the biggest impact I thought. In ~5 years students may be training ChatGPT 4 level agents for college projects.  There will be a company that wraps a sora like model with another deep learning algorithm that optimizes videos pixel by pixel to grab users attention as strongly as possible.  ; All you’ve done is build the road to the gold mine and open the ground; AWS I assume? Still bigger than GCP and Azure I think, though I believe Azure might be seeing more AI demand due to OpenAI? Either way, you have an incredible vantage point on the industry.

This might be true, but o1 has shown us new opportunities for scaling. We still may also see improvements to pre-training with more scale, synthetic data, etc. but I'm not holding my breath for that. However, I do expect improvements with efficiency and optimization of models. Suffice to say that scaling compute isn't the only way to improve.

I'm also excited because I believe we've barely scratched the surface of where we can even implement the current state of AI into the existing economy. E.g. let's assume AI models don't improve at all, there's still 5+ years of progress we could make by efficiently implementing what we have today --  especially as more people get better at understanding how to use it. Though this would shift the focus to inference from training and have implications, but I'm still optimistic.

In a nutshell given that AI is effectively intelligence, my core assumption is that we're more likely to underestimate the impact than overestimate it -- especially given Nvidia's still reasonable P/E ratio (51 as of right now) with supply constraints.

We shall see. I'll continue to share periodic updates on the bets I've made.; Who do you see as the most competitive company in the cloud space? Is Google really making a dent?; If you truly believe that the transformer is only to be applied to customer service chatbots and coding copilots then you sincerely lack imagination.

Look at Waymo, look at Tesla, look at Recursion Pharmaceuticals, look at Palantir, look at BigBear, look at RedCat. There are hundreds of examples of *current* explorations of AI beyond just being a chatbot.

This is just the beginning. The real boon here will be the spilling over of AI into other domains and those unrealized gains are undetermined and difficult to predict, but it’s already begun and I expect it to continue. Very few people beyond research scientists give a shit about the benchmarks everyone harps over. The most important part IMO is how will AI be applied in non-technological domains.; I’m familiar with it, but AI isn’t a new area. What changed is that it finally ‘worked’ enough for people to care. AI has been worked on for decades.

I get your point though, just wanted to clarify where my bullishness comes from in part.; Not OP, but with a good baseline prompt, including telling it to ask clarifying and continuing questions to keep a back-and-forth going, it can be useful to essentially “think out loud” on some problems or ideas that you don’t have fully fleshed out but hit mental road blocks on, or need to find vocabulary for something you might not have. But I as well don’t use it nearly every day, more like a couple times a month.; I most often use it in place of Google for asking questions, looking things up, research, etc. I also take screenshots of things and ask for analysis. A random use case: I'm color blind, so I'll take a picture of clothes and ask if they match -- before buying clothes, matching clothes to wear, etc.

At my startup I'm the CEO and mostly do product, so I don't code much, but I have used it for code.

I also use it for translations (e.g. when doing customer support for non-english speakers).

Our startup uses it as part of our core technology, but we still have a long ways to go -- and so does AI in terms of quality, speed and cost, to be more useful.

I also use it with my kids when they occasionally ask things I don't know when we're driving.

For me it's insane how useful it is and I'd easily pay 10X what I pay for it now ($20/mo) for the same capabilities.

I've never used it to reply to an email.; Ok.; Some people like MCU, others like Duck Dynasty, others like the Housewives reality shows, others like documentaries, others love anything from Disney and Pixar, etc.

I love movies, but rarely discuss them with anyone as it seems you do, so that won't matter for me. And if I could, I'd be watching Sicario sequel #103 tonight, or maybe Iron Man #17 or John Wick #347 because I love the characters and that those kinds of films. Even better, instead of generating a movie to watch, I'd want to 'play' the storyline in a dynamically AI generated VR world, which is even a few steps behind full-length movies.

The point isn't really about what **you** like specifically, but rather anyone can have whatever they like, no matter what it is because the cost of creating it will be near zero -- just whatever compute cycles it takes to generate combined with whatever IP you decide to use (license), whether you want t own or rent it, share it with others (to maybe make a few bucks), etc.

Not everyone will want to create and that's fine, but those who do now can. Just like ever improving smartphone cameras made more people take pictures, how Garage Band, etc. helped more people make music, and how WordPress. made more people bloggers/amateur journalists/writers, etc. It's about democratization, and technology moves every upwards towards higher levels of abstraction. And you can choose to consume what they make or not.

Today the constraint is that tremendous investment has to be made in one thing from one director. But tomorrow, everyone can be a director. Yes, the average quality will go down, but it doesn't matter. It only matters that 1) it's possible and 2) some people will want it.; Definitely not.

To suggest that we are going to only incrementally improve the AI technology when all we really have now is large language models is silliness.

There is going to be so much more.; Not too be confused with TLDR; Yeah people are confusing your 73% rate of return with total return; Average redditor comprehension level.; Then also write your total return bro. Must be close to 200%; It is literally one of the headlines in the post.; I think you’re correct. I would go a step further and say risk adjusted returns are all that matter.; Mine annualized was 73.6%. I added an update to the bottom of the post with the benchmarks for the same period.; >What signal will change your mind on Nvda and Meta?

I doubt it'd be a specific signal since I developed conviction over a long period of time from many signals. But some examples of things that'd change my mind about the future (and would prompt an underwear change 💩😆):

* **Nvidia:** They are no longer supply constrained, particularly if it's due to something pointing to permanently reduced demand like significantly limited returns from GPU scaling.
* **Meta:** They stop seeing returns from implementing AI in ads and see an extended period of reduced or stagnant impression growth resulting in increasingly higher ad prices (counterintuitive, but points to limited future opportunities). Another one might be Apple launching a new wearable that's comparable to Meta's Orion, which points to Apple owning the next platform paradigm, like they did with the iPhone. Another might be some regulation around AI that outlaws their Llama model.

It could be a number of things, but more broadly anything that meaningfully points to AI not being the meaningful trend I think it is. That's not to say there won't be bubbles, busts or that Nvidia/Meta won't have meaningful short-term corrections, but that happens -- I've been investing long enough to be comfortable with those.

>What are you buying today?

Today I actually bought a small amount of SMCI again since they dropped due to the Nasdaq delisting and are still depressed from issues due to their reporting.

But it’s risky since things still seem fishy and it’s more akin to gambling than I’m typically comfortable with, so I only purchased small amount.

I decided to take a chance since their sales still seem strong, but doubt I’ll hold it long term since it’s not a high conviction bet for me, I'm just playing the short-term volatility after watching it for months.

I don't have any plans to buy anything else, but I rarely do. I mostly just trade based on whenever I get new information or valuations change enough to buy/sell, which is unpredictable. I generally don't trade very often, so buying SMCI to hold short-term is unusual for me.; Risk-adjusted (post-tax) returns are what you need to look at. ; Well if OPs figures are annual, then that's a great return.; For context, my IRR was \~73% compared to the S&P 500's \~16% during this period.

Further, the vast majority of my returns qualified for long-term capital gains.; Yes, but just about every major company is AI forward thinking right now. I haven't followed reddit's business for a long time, thus don't know it well.

Meta on the other hand I watched for a long time, including the bust following ATT (when I bought) through their reemergence as an I leader.

A lot goes into it, but I just don't invest in business I don't know well and I don't know reddit well. There's also not enough history as a public company to learn about it yet.; Yes, the news about Willow came out after I sold hah. I don't know if that would have changed my mind though since that's a ways from commercial application. I also stated 'relatively unexciting **near term** prospects' and I don't consider the commercial viability of their quantum computing long-term.

As I said in the original comment I am excited about their long-term prospects, just more excited about the others.; In this portfolio, yes for now. I’ll miss out on some upside, but things felt frothy so I wanted to capitalize on the post-election bump. META and NVDA seemed to have the most reasonable valuation given earnings growth x moats.

Today I bought a small amount of SMCI on the Nasdaq delisting news since they are depressed, but not a long-term thing, just holding until they recover a bit. More just having fun than anything since holding 2 stocks is a bit boring 😆

But I expect to buy others once I feel things are more reasonable.

As always, I could be completely wrong so…; Haha. It used to be awful at math but now it’s pretty good, especially if you tell it to double check it’s work. And man, o1 is just on a different level despite being pretty new. Excited to see where it’ll be in a couple years.; No, I'm specifically asking more about how you achieved a \~70% annual rate of return like I did with your index during that period. Show me as I've shown you.

I share these transparent updates for feedback, to learn and get better. But to value your criticism, I have to know if it's legit or no different than the other negative comments here 💩 That's why I want to know how you did it.

An observation: You seem to imply that I don't follow investing best practices or what most professional investors do. **And you're right.**

But if I did I'd have nothing interesting to share because alpha comes from being contrarian and right. And when I build strong conviction on something, I go all in as I've shown (I did the same in the last recession).

When I don't have strong conviction (which is most of the time), I'm in an index to at least match the market. If I shared these updates while in an index or in cash (as I was before these updates started in 2022), they wouldn't be worth sharing.; Also wondering this.; > given that AI is effectively intelligence

This seems like a strange viewpoint for someone in the industry as opposed to, well, marketing. What we're calling AI now is nothing more than autocomplete. A very powerful form of it, sure, but there's no intelligence there.

I do firmly believe that GPT-3 and ChatGPT were essentially both the beginning and the end of what's possible. If only because we're firmly running out of new suitable training data. Right now, we're all just waiting out the clock to see when the capital figures this out.

Staying with Nvidia is clever, though. They're profitable while the companies using their hardware are operating at a loss with no realistic path to profitability. They don't need AI to work, they just need people to think it will. I'd be concerned about Nvidia's pivot, though.

So far, the industry has managed to keep specialized GPUs relevant ever since that first started for hashing / blockchain mining. But if AI becomes less relevant and there's nothing to fill the gap, I'd be concerned whether Nvidia can retain its position next to AMD for more general purpose hardware.; People like to be cynical. Nothing ever happens!

Sora is bigger than video generation. LLMs gain an understanding of the semantic space through prediction, within which is encoded true and useful relationships.

eg X ""To get eggs I went to the _blank_"" Is semantically similar to Y ""You can get eggs at the store"", so an LLM that had Y in the training set can generalize to things like X.

Well Sora and other video prediction tools gain an understanding of the video space, which encodes physically useful relationships. If you go watch Sora, you'll see it understands some things, like lighting and shadows some physical processes, but then not others... Yet. Just like you can generate an agent from a powerful LLM, you will soon be able to do the same with video gen, but it will actually have a physical understanding of the world. 

We would then be ~2/3 of the way to a fully autonomous talking humanoid robot. The other third being integrating these 2 + physical control mechanism into one model.

Hahahaha haha; I also worked for a major provider and deployed these models .. and talk to tip of the spear expert resources deploying these models at customer sites on a weekly basis at major household brands and firms. 

I'm sorry but you are repeating everything I hear from 'experts' with no actual understanding of how these tools are playing out in the enterprise space. OP who works at the cloud provider is dead on, and I know for a fact that many firms are not seeing the returns they were hoping for and panic is starting to set in. These firms pivoted so hard that major issues are popping up elsewhere in their already massive tech stacks 

Yes yes yes, people use them every day... But they have massive limitations and when you bring this up to people who are on the outside trying to look in, all you hear is ""yea but we are just scratching the surface""; Transformer architecture has been a thing since 2017. Some of the examples you give are in fact big data rebranded as AI.


This whole bubble is based on the _perception_ that AI is ""thinking"" because it mimics human speech pretty well. Behind the scenes, it's based on things discovered years ago and scaled up. And we're at the end of the scaling up part.


It's going to work 97% of the time but the last 3% is so critical that it can never be trusted to do a whole critical job, and once companies start charging enough to break even on their products the value may not be there. ; They have made one specifically for AI with different types of AI broken down to where they are on the cycle. It's worth a look even just for a balanced view, obviously can't predict the future.

By 'new' area I mean one that isn't mature / plateaud; GenAI is still garbage for any true SME material where accuracy matters. Garbage in, garbage out. The worst part is the people most tempted to use it or the ones who are typically least likely to catch the nuanced errors that are still pervasive.

It's nice for generating code, but we've actually banned it on any client related deliverable work at my consulting firm because the hallucinations are as bad as ever. Doesn't help that they've run out of public internet content to feed these models so now they are feeding them AI-generated content to learn, which is just ass backwards AF. I recall reading that chatgpt-5 is based on like 40% AI-generated synthetic content lol...and the accuracy is barely any better than 4.

I don't find tools that spit out routinely questionable content to be that useful personally. And I'm not alone, industry is still struggling to actually monetize these features and customers continue to not be impressed. Hell even isheep don't believe in it...

They are destroying OpenAI; Did you look for a breakout /technicals before buying smci or just strong short term conviction about the recovery?; I work in one of this top giants with LLMs for the past few years. The predictive text argument is correct and wrong at the same time. There’s more juice to it than it may seem.

LLMs do learn to recognise and apply patterns and it’s what they do exclusively and by design, all correct. But a solution process is a pattern too. For example, when you see 11x12=? you either know the answer because you learned the pattern before or apply a step-by-step process to get to it. Both are patterns and LLMs can do both.

LLMs have been trained mostly with the first type of pattern because it’s the most available kind of data. RLHF has oppened the door to process-type patterns. but the data is much harder and expensive to curate. The introduction of agents will make it way easier to record processes and their outcomes, accelerating the improvement cycle.

That’s on the research side. On the market side there are tens of thousands of companies that will soon see a real value on moving to the cloud and have their piles of static data become actually usable. It is already STARTING to change every single industry; >But if AI becomes less relevant and there's nothing to fill the gap, I'd be concerned whether Nvidia can retain its position next to AMD for more general purpose hardware.

I'd be concerned about this too, but I fundamentally disagree. For example:

>What we're calling AI now is nothing more than autocomplete. A very powerful form of it, sure, but there's no intelligence there.

You could call it that, but human cognition also relies on recognizing patterns and applying them recursively. AI is different in that it does the same with language without understanding it, but it's pattern matching nonetheless -- not so different than humans.

>I do firmly believe that GPT-3 and ChatGPT were essentially both the beginning and the end of what's possible. If only because we're firmly running out of new suitable training data.

GPT 3.5 and 4 with significant improvements beyond 3, making new things possible. I experienced this directly as when they came out I was at a public company building their first AI products. ""ChatGPT"" is just a chatbot interface and the first application of AI that really brought it into public awareness, which is why it's immensely important. But the chatbot UI is just the beginning. It's kind of like how with the internet everything was 'internet enabled' and with mobile there was a mobile version of every website (remember the .mobi extension?), etc. But now the internet is just part of everything. The same will happen to AI.

I use AI multiple times a day and have built multiple products with it than generate strong revenues (people pay for it because they find it useful). Maybe you have different experiences. I don't expect to change your mind here, but I guess we'll see what happens.; Very well said.

That is another exciting aspect, will models like Sora help us create a model of reality?

That's also one of the key differences in how Tesla is now training its FSD (video) vs. Waymo (Lidar).

While it's fun to talk about what we're seeing today, there's no doubt there's a ton of latent discoveries and opportunities that we haven't scratched the surface of.; I think AI does what humans can do in those spaces being discussed here but without the efficiency/cost reduction of ""intuition."" That is, humans work more like quantum computers, meaning that current AI, limited by the traditional hardware paradigm, can do the same thing but requires much more cost.; >I know for a fact that many firms are not seeing the returns they were hoping for and panic is starting to set in. These firms pivoted so hard that major issues are popping up elsewhere...

I agree, and people said the same thing about the internet and electricity, e.g. when they just swapped steam engines for electric motors without redesigning factory workflows. They're called disruptive technologies for a reason.

I also saw the same thing at the public company I left a year ago trying to implement AI, so I 100% agree with you. Don't you remember last year when every public CEO was scrambling to come up with an 'AI strategy'? Of course most of them are garbage. Even outside of AI, how often do even basic refactors at large organizations end well? 😆

But there's a reason the opposite is true at newer companies standing up AI in new functions because when you start from zero you don't have to wrestle with the legacy assumptions and stacks (think building a new house vs. renovating an old one).

This is true for every new technology. In fact, has there ever been a groundbreaking new technology that just 'slid right in' to the existing paradigm without a hitch?

One way to help see around this is asking:

* Can the new technology do a meaningful number of things in a new and better way?
* Is it expected to continue to get better, cheaper and faster?
* Do we expect the advantages to outweigh the disruption, friction and growing pains of implementing it?
* Will companies who successfully implement the technology have a meaningful competitive advantage over those who don't?

Maybe you really believe the answer to those questions is no, and that's fine. But I believe the answer is yes with strong conviction.; Interesting find, thanks.

https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/hype-cycle-for-artificial-intelligence; I think he's arguing that we are starting the maturing stage, and that AI was initially worked on years ago.; Gotcha, thank you for clarifying. I agree, it's worth looking at for a balanced view, I will check it out.; I disagree with your sentiment, but I do agree there's some truth in some of your examples and I do agree that Apple Intelligence sucks.; It’s less about ‘religion’ and more about observation. Anyone paying attention can see the transformative impact AI already has across industries — from automating complex tasks to accelerating research and innovation. Calling it ‘religion’ dismisses the very real, tangible changes happening today.; I'm very new to all this - can you help me understand the two metrics in the context of this conversation? I tried asking Perplexity but it didn't help as much.; Yes i totally agree. But you can write total return with a time period. Somehow that makes it easier for laymen.; That's fair.

Getting lazy trying to respond to all comments.; Just strong short term conviction about the recovery, particularly since they are one of Nvidia's key partners, which is driving their strong revenue growth. So it really ties back to strong conviction in Nvidia.; > Both are patterns and LLMs can do both.

…no? It's a large *language* model. It doesn't know the meaning of 11 or 12. There is no way for it to understand in a general way that multiplying by 12 is one more than multiplying by 11. Sure, you can train it on lots of calculations and keep fine-tuning it until it gets most of them right. But what you're doing then is taking computers (which are really good at computing) and making them compute like a human (which are not). I… fail to see the benefit of this.

> It is already STARTING to change every single industry

I never denied this. I'm just pretty sure it's also *finishing*. The fact that a change happened is no guarantee that it will continue happening.; > AI is different in that it does the same with language without understanding it, but it's pattern matching nonetheless 

No it isn't. It's just statistically deciding the likelihood of one token following a sequence of tokens. That is all. There is absolutely nothing else going on than just that. The more tokens you can fit in your context and the more data you throw into your model, the more comprehensible the output becomes, yes. But that's still not pattern matching, it's just predictive text.

>  making new things possible

Like what? I still remember hearing the same arguments about Bitcoin. It was also going to be part of everything. That didn't exactly pan out.

> and have built multiple products with it than generate strong revenues

Did you train your own models? Do you run inference on your own hardware? If the answer to either or both of those questions is 'no', then your strong revenues depend on other companies operating at a loss to provide these things for you. How sustainable do you think that is?; Waymo is also different in the way the problem is approached IMO. They started with a ""simple version of the problem"" (Phoenix with flat grid-like layout), they geofence the autonomous area, there are operation centers (which I think will never go away) that monitor and can intervene remotely if required. It's rather unemotional and more pragmatic in the sense that they don't just seem to assume that the problem can be solved automagically in all its forms and variations, but providing the autonomous ride service is priority #1 and not general self-driving.

They can scale up the business city by city and capture the parts of the market that bring a lot of $$$ (vast urban areas with simple traffic environment), learn and fix/constraint the product, so it becomes viable and as efficient as possible without having the ambition/pressure to solve it for the entire (ever-changing) global system of roads all at once.; NP, it's closer to 300%.; Yeah, no worries. You should expect to get your balls busted after making a brag post about how much money you made on NVDA and Meta (not exactly sleeper picks there) with your reasoning being AI, trust me. Lots of us went heavy AI and made life changing money these past few years. Question is whether it will keep rolling or slow down in the mid term. Your posts so far don't inspire me that you've got much of an edge looking forward. But what do I know?; I disagree, but I appreciate your insight. We shall see.; Yep, that's a good point. Given it seems every Tesla is collecting data and Elon is building ever bigger clusters, maybe they'll break through with the AI getting good enough to allow fully autonomous driving like Waymo in some areas.

If that actually happens it seems they'd be hard to catch up with given the immense data advantage. But then again, there are other meaningful economic dynamics to make things really work. Like will people want their cars to be used as Robotaxis? If not, will Tesla really want that capital expense? Will there be Tesla 'roadlords' who own a stable of cars to get rented out? Will the layouts of cities change when car ownership drops, therefore reducing the need to even use cars on a daily basis long-term?

Exciting times.; Okay, *now* I believe you."
Investing in publicly-traded assets to benefit from AI automation,"What are the best strategies/channels to access investments that are hypothesized to benefit from advancements in AI and agentic workflow automation?

Are there funds focused on this? I'm specifically thinking about how some big public incumbent companies will be hurt by it (like Chegg) and others will greatly benefit from it. There must be a number of criteria that can be evaluated based on publicly available data and are hypothesized to correlate with positive financial outcomes in the age of AI automation. For example:

\-big white collar labor expenditures as a percentage of revenue and costs, indicating an outsized return on bottom line EBITDA from investing in AI automation

\-large audiences

\-large proprietary databases and content

\-large R&D budgets

\-defensible network effects. etc.

How can I easily and effectively invest to benefit from these kinds of hypotheses? For the sake of focus, fine to focus the conversation on publicly traded stocks and funds.

I know there are AI tools to analyze SEC filings, and I could build a list of hypotheses to evaluate, but this is a lot of work and others are better suited to do it than I (and I assume already have).

EDIT: I'm looking to identify companies that benefit from second order effects of AI rather than chip makers and LLM builders like META, MSFT, GOOG, AAPL, NVDA.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hfea7v/investing_in_publiclytraded_assets_to_benefit/,1,2024-12-16 08:57:33,"Generally speaking, all companies everywhere will benefit from AI. 

We rolled out LLM AI to handle IT and HR claims last year. 5 years ago we started converting the factory to an AI based scheduling system, and AI based fault monitoring. The past 40 years have been improvements in automation and computers.

Looks like we should be asking you for advice.; Retiring at 45 with $1M sounds great in practice, but I'd wager you'd end up working again within 10-20 years. At that point, wait till 55-60, keep stacking paper, and have a more secure/fun retirement that'll last. People tend to underestimate both healthcare costs, as well as outright boredom when retiring early, especially when they do it thinking ""I only need x per month to cover my bills.""

Solid goal. Nice work keeping your total list of trades manageable. I reco no more than a dozen, and rotate when you see an opportunity 50% better than a current holding. 
2) you’re not tax efficient. You need more of these big wins in your Roth. Don’t undervalue the ability to “freely rotate” positions into better ones without taking on cost. When you decide to sell any of your brokerage positions look into “mega backdoor strategies”. It’s going to help you get to your goal about 30%faster. 
3) only add in ETFs if you’re looking to de-risk bc that pot of money needs to be more stable than the others in case of a downturn or upcoming purchase (but you own a house already). Right now at 35, with a 25y investing horizon and frankly- a ways to go before you reach your goals, ETFs aren’t doing you any favors in the short term. Similar comment for $BKB which is kinda just holding other stuff.

If you're relying on just the $173,000 to get you to a million, it'll take you 19 years assuming an above average 10% returns annually.  Also, if you're planning to retire early, remember you need considerably more than you would if you're planning to retire at 65.

You’ll reach 1M before 45 with your quality portfolio imo!

Well done again!; I'm 40. At 35 i had about 150k in market. Today it's worth 1.7m. My advice...

Put bulk of portfolio in things like VOO, QQQ, VTI etc. A little overlap is fine. At least 65%. Almost all if you don't know what you're doing. 

Dividend investing is overrated.

Keep a really nice emergency fund or some sort of quick liquidity for a downturn. Millions are made in the bear market. Run in when others are running away. You need the capital to do it tho.

I firmly believe bitcoin isn't going away. 1 to 5% ibit at least.

Take the other 20 to 30% and buy individual stocks but only after you paper traded and feel extremely confident. This requires more research and time. 

1m isn't nearly enough to retire.  Think 5m with inflation in 10 years. 

Cashflow is important so keep the business and just delegate to employees when the time comes?

High net worth in brokerage opens up doors to massive opportunities.  Think margin loans, covered calls, etc. You can make money on the shares you own. Just manage risk. You can loan yourself money to invest elsewhere for like 6% apr with only interest due. 

Manage those taxes well. Don't forget about ira, hsa, solo 401k etc.; Dude the good news is that youre a worker, you know how to work.

Im a truck driver and I’ll need to work until 60. Btw. 45 is very very young. Your 40’s are epic. Use that time while your body works. Shoot for 55 yo to retire.

Hedge funds don't beat the S&P500, and neither will you.

At 35 you should have at least 25% of your investments in Bitcoin/ETH, the other 75% split evenly between QQQ and SPY.

Don't listen any morons in here saying 25% is too much for crypto btw, they are most likely poor or old money and have absolutely no idea what they're talking about.

They are good companies but you are still very concentrated.  I’d consider taking a chunk out of all of them and buying VOO.  Other than that you’re seeing good growth, but it cannot last.; You are doing great 😊 
You may be ready for the next step. Unless you have already talk to an expert about your next step in betting on yourself. Next job/career or starting another business. There is so much opportunities for someone like you who actively looked to the future. 
You got this; Take all this out and put it in crypto. You will retire this bull cycle; Buy Fartcoin and retire next year; Buy etfs for each sector of stock market.  I think there are 12 or something.  That way when one sector is doing badly the others will pick up the slack.  Slow and steady investing wins the race.  But also diversify into real estate if you can. If you camt manage directly stick some money in a reit or invest with a company with a good track record. Tske 3 to 5% of your networth and invest in something asymetric like crypto.; Nice job investing…. According to Kramer, are you diversified?  Not really but the stocks you own are all worth owning. I own 8 of the stocks you have in your portfolio. 
Add Costco or Coke or Home Depot. Or maybe a oil which is low now like Chevron; Pretty good portfolio positions.  Might want to consider some high dividend stocks, BTC exposure (MSTR for example), some other sectors like finance (SOFI, Banks, etc), consumer staples, and other sectors besides tech.  Your portfolio is like 95% tech sector that will get wrecked at some point without a little diversification.; Hi what app are you using? Thanks!; If you are planning to hold gains for another 20-25 years that would mean holding until after age 65+ which means you should definitely be making the max deposit of $7,000 into a Roth IRA each year to get capital gains free profits.

My other and more important  advice is to please invest in Bitcoin. It does have to be all your investments, but seriously consider it. $FBTC is a very easy way to buy into bitcoin in a Roth IRA and get 100% correlations to bitcoin’s price. Bitcoin is up 1300% over the last 5 years and has outperformed the S&P500 over any 5 year span you start at.

Many people dismiss bitcoin as a scam or Ponzi scheme, they don’t understand it yet. If you want something that you can trust will have longterm gains, put part of your investments into bitcoin.; take the money and run; Honestly suck a smart idea think of it as a 401k; Yea 45 is out of the question unless you have 2 million.

If you finance the purchase of a primary residence the interest payments on your mortgage will be tax deductible. This, combined with the appreciation on your real estate investment will produce wealth over time. You will be far better off in the long run to buy now than wait.; Google is facing a gauntlet of anti trust lawsuits, depending on the outcome this could potentially result an a significant decrease in share value since investor confidence in the company is largely based on its perceived near monopoly in its spaces.

Maybe consider rebalancing away from that company.

NVIDIA currently has a near monopoly on semiconductor architecture that power the growing use of AI models. And while many think AI is the buzz word of the year like blockchain was a few years ago. And is probably in a bubble.

NVIDIA plays the roll of the person selling shovels to people running for the California hills in this particular gold rush.; I want to learn how to do this. I have no clue.

I’d start cashing out and buying up ETFs; So first off congratulations! But this has to be one of the highest volatility portfolios I’ve ever seen! You e done well but this is a ticking time bomb. You are almost 100% in Large cap tech sector only. Stop buying individual stocks and buy index funds. You already have a lot of the top S&P 500 stocks… so I wouldn’t do VOO, VTI would be better for you because it has a little mid and small cap as its a total market fund. Then get a little international exposure of like 5% with VXUS. You also need some bond allocation 10% to 20% I run 15% myself with 10% in BND and 5% in BNDX which is international bonds. 5% in a REIT like VNQ would also further diverse you into real estate. I’d also add some dividend funds… I like SCHD, VIG, and VYM I own all 3. With how heavy you are in tech I’d also say add some sector ETFs like VDE, VHT, VPU to get some exposure in healthcare, pharma, utilities, gas and oil. You could also add some consumer discretionary and consumer staples. Diversify and do it quickly. If a tech bubble hits you’re going to lose half your money overnight.

Your portfolio looks very good. I wish I had that.

Serious question: how did you go about picking these particular stocks? What have been your sources?

I know it’s a lotta tech but personally I missed out on Nvidia for example. How do you keep yourself up to date?

Thank you!; 1mln isn't enough to retire at 45 if you planning to live +- to 80; What app is this?; 1.2 million is the staple but a lot articles coming out saying 2.5 is the new retirement goal.; 1 million will not be enough, 10 years from now and based on your lively hood you’re going to need 4 times that if you want to retired at 45.  Obviously there are hundreds of variables in this, but I’m 50 and have reached that 1m mark, but no where near where I’d need to be to live off that for another 30 years.

I would add dividend paying stocks temporarily reinvesting them when U pull the plug U can start taking checks I employed that strategy and it pays me very well.  They’re boring but typically utility stocks pay good dividends/returns.  Best wishes!; Here is a simple plan for you. Also, good job with your portfolio today.  Here are some suggestions:

1.  If you qualify for a Roth IRA do that ASAP and max it out. This will also provide you a rainy day fund; meaning, all the money you put in there (7,500 per year) is after tax money. You can almost treat it like a saving account to an extent. At any point you can take out whatever money you put in anytime. You’re only penalized taking money out on interest earned. Also, if you have kids any money in your Roth can be used for college education without penalty. 

2. While it’s nice paying your home off leverage equity in your house when rates drop, assuming you have an interest rate when they were at all time lows during COVID. 2 a 3.5%. I personally took out equity in my home at a rate of 3.2% and invested in mutual funds that have provided returns the last 4 years above 26% (FXAIX and FDGRX).  I leveraged money to make money.

3. While smaller - make sure you’re in a money market account related to your checking account.  I am in a high yield account providing a 4.6% return on my money. 

4. Think about CDs right now. Rates are still above 5% percent which is guaranteed return. 

I listed a few basic options for growing your portfolio. There are many alternatives but figured I’d help you with a few basic items. 

Good luck; Personally I get antsy when I have a single stock that gets over 10% of my portfolio. That’s a lot of risk. Maybe consider pulling back on your top 3.; Dividend, dividend, DIVIDEND! KR good price now, KO, IBM, P&G, and MO is near 10% on return. Godspeed sir.; not even one red in your portfolio? I think you can and should advice to other people.; Depends where you live. 1 mil is really not enough… also if you’ve been saving since 17 years with only 173k, that’s the change you can grow it by 800k within next 10?

My goal is 3 mil + paid off home. But I will settle for 2.  I’m currently half way there and I should be there when I hit 60. (I’m the same age as you); Think about starting to get some passive income by way of dividend yield and diversifying into some reit and energy opportunities with your future contributions. A good mix of growth and divs is great.; All in mstr and you will retire at 45; Sorry to be blunt but you're delusional if you think either of your target are achievable.

- Retiring on a million bucks is not really a thing anymore.  Doing it at the age of 45 is just foolish

Don’t listen to the TV when it’s panic season just take it as a reference and make your own decision; Yes yes yes 👍🏻; No doubt man.  I guess I worded my title weird with the “retirement” at 45.

I remember when apple hit 1 T. Sold everything because I thought there was no way growth was there. Boy was I wrong. You might be right in selling but not because of the 3.3 trillion thesis.; Why dividend stocks??; My thought of retirement is a little different I guess and made it confusing. By 45 I’d like to cut back and work 50% less. I don’t want to be the guy that stops working outside because I love it. Just cut back; That’s the thought with the 2% xrp investment.

Almost everyone here goes to mexico for 2-4 months just off of that one check alone. I know some that dont touch their savings at all and just use their unemployment (650 biweekly) to live off of.. so yeah its enough. Maybe not in the US but it is elsewhere; It is if you go full dividend portfolio and live modestly.; Options and 2x leverage  😂; What's the point?; Thank you.  I’ve got the Roth setup now for the past 5 years.   I’ve got about 30,000 in that out of this total.    Yes money market for my savings on Etrade is around 4.25% right now; I’ve done some of that with HCA in this current environment…. Putting that into Amazon / Tesla; I try to only buy stocks if they drop 3% on a single day 

I have my RSI set to 66-33 to give me a little clearer view of the momentum

Only reason some aren’t red was just time in the market I’d say. I’ve sold plenty of stuff in the red and covered it with a positive over time. I try to not do that often; Canadian here 👋 

There doesn't appear to be enough context to make that judgement.

A common scenario I could come up with, they saved what they could each year, 18 to 25 like $2-4k/yr as a student going for their masters, 25-28 still the same because they paid student debt, and after that they're now saving $35k/yr.

It all depends on the distribution of their saving capacity, where they are in reference to the ceiling of their profession and then how close they are to the floor of their spending.

I've seen nurses in Canada be DINKs in their 30s, only live on their partners salary and plow $35-60k/yr into savings. Plus the RRSP refund for deferral income. Then factor in compound interest during that time and they're close to what OP said. Canadians for example also have TFSA which are accounts with base table contribution room of ~$100k and anything yielded within the account is non-taxed.

Bridging say until 45-60 for early OAS and CPP from the government to kick in.; That’s my goal to switch this to a dividend paying portfolio when it gets time to slow down; That’s a worse idea all else equal.  Forced taxes,  no greater returns.; Big crash coming every year; [deleted]; I would like to think mega cap could outpace inflation; I own the business now 👍🏻; Then you want to coastFIRE, basically stop contributing at 45 but still live off work money.; And the issue is that if you do that, your investment pot will stay the same. With inflation, not sure you have a comparable retirement at 65.

I would just work until you get the one million and then decide what to do. For me at least, it did not change much as our pension contribution did drop, but not to such a degree as to really feel the difference. ; A lot of good stable American companies pay 7%ish or even more. High quality dividend ETFs pay 5%. So you could definitely get more than 2k a month on a million. Just sayin.; I’m in a similar mindset. I’m 36 and have just over $200k. I save about 60% of my income at the moment. 

Hoping to hit a million between 45-50 and then cut down to part time or do something I enjoy that pays less.; Bro just hang in there 20 more years.  You’re doing well and could hang it up at 55 which gives you a ton of quality years to enjoy.  Try to diversify into real estate.  Slightly more work than stocks but it’s manageable, and the returns are better.  And importantly, can continue to go up even if the stock market stayed even for 20 years; Some Yieldmax might be able to help you with that.; 发热体应该还好; Invest in quantum more bang for your buck and its an upcoming technology trust; [removed]; Oh most definitely. Some places you can purchase a property or two for a total of say 800k and live of the rent as a king.; Yeah I hate how people come out of the woodwork to shoot people like OP down. $1MM could be more than enough depending on expenses and where OP plans on retiring; that would be the smartest move; Thailand is definitely not cheap, when you add up costs including medical will need more than that; 1. He’ll be 45 ten years from now. Weaker dollar and inflation. That means those expenses will be higher. 

2. 45k a year gives you 25 years not considering growth of investment. But 45k a year will eat into your principal fast (it will be higher than this due to inflation). 

3. Spy does not give consistent 10% every year. There are years it makes money and looses money. The years it looses money you have to sell more equities to cover expenses. 1m could fall to 800k in a year with spy. If I have to sell spy at a loss one year I’ve sold a lot more equites. 

$2.5-$3m is when you can really get by fine. House paid off. Money running in the market you don’t have to take out to build more wealth. And expenses covered. $1m at 45 is not enough for those and many other reasons; not at 45; The dividend strategy is long dead as a winner. It only still survives because people like it in theory. You'll end up with more money by keeping the money in VOO and selling when you need some.; Hahahahah; Don’t sell, buy more typically is better advice for index investing. Doubling down on an individual name after it loses 50%+ is not always great. Holding 25% of your net worth in NVDA is also a recipe for volatility; Vanguard S&P 500 ETF -> VOO; I buy Schwab ETFs. Just buy 50% SCHB (Broad market) and 50% SCHD (Dividend). You will see quarterly dividend income reinvested from both these ETFs and your portfolio will keep growing. When the markets are down, then these will be down too but not as much as the Mag 7 or any individual stock.; SCHD; SPY, QQQ, TLT (long term bonds), BIL (short term bonds); SCHD if you want dividends; If you like tech (which you seem to) consider QQQ.; its what I want to do as well.  bonds are a joke.  and if you are just a little short, a small position in a covered call ETF isn't bad.  especially if you choose one that doesn't hurt your principal over time.  don't let anyone beat you up, dividends are not bad.  they are important to all total returns.  People get caught up in hugh Growth sticks.  diversification is ok.  also check out Reits.  check out VICI and ADC.  I keep a small position in both so I can follow it and see how things go.; VOO is good for now durring accumulation.  He's talking SCHD for later, my guy; yes, there are 3 screen shots they uploaded.  you only seen the first one I think.  you got to swipe; Okay, partial retirement is completely different because you still have some money coming in.  

You didn’t answer the most important part of the question.  How much will you be contributing each year?  Even with a 10% average return, you are looking at 20 years before your $170,000 turns into a million.

With a more conservative interest rate of 7% you will need to contribute around $4,000 per month to reach 1 million in 10 years (ignoring inflation).; I think you’re really underestimating inflationary pressures. Get yourself out of the trenches and into a management position if at all possible; MA 200p dec20 got it. Yoloooo!; Lol most noob opinion I've seen recently. You know nothing yet. Hfsp.; Agree and I love RSI tracking as well; honestly 😂 earlier this month when it shot up was a W its timing it similar to stocks and the analysis from sources aswell as the charts, managed to sell when it dipped got a 150% return and gonna put some more back in soon just trying to pin point when, but even that shows, if you can spot patterns the returns are so much better, See bitcoin as Gold its the safe slow way(the store house) but also you need the other incomes (the shit coins that shits coins if done correctly) to increase how much you put into the store house if that analogy makes sense; That’s hard earned money to put all into something as volatile as crypto. Not saying you shouldn’t invest, but maybe allocate a reasonable percentage so you don’t end up with nothing. A lot of people make a fortune off of crypto trading but many others lose it as well.; Be careful of a tech market downturn, it would likely obliterate your portfolio, maybe move to broader index fund with more stocks in it from multiple markets. It’ll be slower gains but much more stable in long run; I had never heard of HCA today but it looks like it’s at the bottom of an ascending channel from a technical standpoint. A lot of people like SPY and QQQ because they contain a lot or all of these stocks listed above and many more. These ETFs will tend to outperform in both bull and bear markets. And the reason I would sell XRP is because it just rallied off the charts and with crypto being very technical responsive it seems like it has a lot of correcting to do. Amazon definitely hold for life and Tesla seems overvalued to me but speculation is high with trump in office. I like all the other picks though good value stocks; This should have been on the original post. Only other recommendation would be keep savings rate high, save 25% of income at a minimum.

 I’d also recommend take advantage of all the different tax advantage accounts you can have. Sounds like you could be 1099 or small business? Get an ira going and look into what options you might have for your income bracket.; What is mag7?; No one is even close to have a robot which can fold my laundry.; XRP actually looks very good I would hold it.

In general though yeah it is easier/safer to just buy Bitcoin and forget it.; Dont listen to some user named DICKPIXTHROWAWAY unless you want to lose all your money; Less risk, income producing.; Perfect! Are you working to transition from employee to owner? A million in the bank is wage slave think. Gross a million a year instead.

Disclaimer: Am dumbass who does not gross a million a year.... yet. Give me eight to ten more years at about 15% growth haha.; Do you own your own busines, or work for someone else?; Because you don't know what it is, how it works or why to hold it.; That why you buy some sector ETFs, some international exposure and you need bonds yesterday.; Ya I could easily at 4%/year. Even 3%; Not if the account is a Roth- you won’t get taxed; with the name aggressive gambler, it's probably not a great idea; Perhaps build your strategy using a market sim. First - 🤷‍♂️; Delegate and expand.; Personally I don't mind full time work, especially in my current job which I love. I'm just investing to get the cash together to buy a house outright so that I never have to pay for rent/mortgage ever again. From there, the next goal is have enough money from investments that my partner can pursue her goal as an artist full time too.

I think anyone looking at FIRE is how to make shelter as cheap as possible, or free if you can help it. Shelter seems to be the biggest investment youll ever make; It wont stay the same the stock market doesn’t just pause tf you talking about. He can take the dividends while the stocks continue to gain in value; he's assuming the market will keep rallying for the next 10 yrs. This is not very likely whatsoever.

like others here, i would just recommend saving what you can. try to live independently (be a handyman, farm a bit, be frugal).

don't aim for any set figure. instead aim to be frugal and have faith in your government. your government rewards frugality and hard work. whether benchmark outcome you arrive on, trust i your government to look after you. (ie: be careful who you vote for. dont vote for trump-types).; $500K in 7% tax free municipal bonds pays $35K/yr.  This leaves a large chunk of your $$$ available to grow. Even at a 10% S&P yield it'll double every 7.; With the potential to lose a lot of your principal. There's a reason people derisk as they grow older.; What good stocks pay 7%?; Exactly; For me at least, I realized that you can stop your contributions and use that money on other things, but you cannot actually take the cash out, not just yet if you have about 15 more years before you trigger a pension. 

So, I am 50, and I have reached my target and I plan to stop contribution to the pension fund, and  spend that cash elsewhere. From 55 to 60-ish, we might start to tap the pension fund a nice lifestyle, but really not stop working. from 60-ish, the idea is withdraw more and do part time until 67, then keep on going until we cannot go any more. 

The it be at home most of the time, and the pension will be used for better healthcare (helper, nurse, etc) until we die.  

Stopping work is not really an option yet, both for mental and frankly, 1M is not enough any more; 60% is an awesome figure well done!  I’m 34% to pension and 20% ISA.; In what century is the returns better with real estate then equities?  The only benefit to real estate is you can buy it on debt and have a tenant pay the note.  If you’re working with your own money (like OP is talking about) or don’t want to deal with renters then equities have outperformed by a wide margin.; wtf…; VOO's average returns are roughly 18% a year when split up on the 5 year chart -- this is 160k a year to do nothing. After taxes it's still like having a 160k a year job -- unless you're raising kids in your retirement this is more than enough. 

You don't need to sit and wait on it, you just have to work for one year while it compounds the first year and then you start paying yourself.

If this isn't enough to retire you might have different standards for retirement than the average person.; What am I missing?; Agreed. Buying individual stocks in general is not recommended.; why VOO and not SPY; I don’t see the appeal of SCHD tbh. Not good in taxable accounts due to higher tax rate on dividends and it underperforms VOO over time.; Thanks for those. I’ll save those to my watch list; Thoughts on QQQ?; Added to Roth; Added; Why would SCHD be better later?; Oh... I feel dumb now. I guess I didn't notice it. Thanks!; These % returns aren't relevant to him. He is picking individual stocks and might make it to that 1 million from it or very likely lose a lot of his current principle instead.; Right now I am investing around 1,000 a month sometimes 1,500 if I can but mostly saving as cash on the sideline for dip buying. 

I need to start setting it up more per month, but I’ve preferred saving ammo for dips and invest heavier on specific drops then spreading it out each month; 😂 yeah I guess; Yes, HCA is always been solid for me. It’s had a tough month or two just now but I do believe it’ll bounce back. I was just doing some portfolio management. I had too much percentage.; Correct.  I have a separate ROTH going with around 30,000 of this total in it.  My tax lady got me into that IRA about 5 years ago; MAG-7 is a pump-action shotgun manufactured by Techno Arms PTY of South Africa since 1995. Ask your wife’s boyfriend if he’ll take you to the range sometime.; https://www.investopedia.com/magnificent-seven-stocks-8402262

The Magnificent Seven stocks are a group of high-performing and influential companies in the U.S. stock market: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla.; Do you have a preference between Bitcoin and Bitcoin ETF?; No I started my landscaping business about 8 years ago. Everything is now paid off so I can start stacking back for my portfolio; Own my own business; Well then you won’t get better returns anyway; Doesn’t work. Sim trading never works becuase it not your money you are risky and mindset changes everything in trading. 

Now if you are already successful and have a build a solid capital trading. Sim trading can be a good way to test out new strategy

Sim trading for a beginner with zero experience will just give them a dangerous false sense of confidence; Then why would you wait until you have a $1M to buy a house outright?! If you have 20% down payment then do it right away bc like you said you still have to pay rent in the meantime so why not pay your own mortgage instead of someone else’s mortgage?! A property has 2 things working for you: 1 house values tend to go up over time by 5-10% a year on average and secondly your principle payments towards the mortgage brings that balance down. If your horizon is 10 to 20 years then the mortgage should be close to paid off in 25 years. If you have a basement or rent out a portion of the house then the rent will help pay down that mortgage faster. Later if you want to be more aggressive refinance the equity in the first home and use that as a down payment to buy a rental property and rent it out. As long as it’s cash flow positive you are making money and having someone else pay your mortgage for you! In the meantime keep investing in the market but definitely diversify your portfolio with real estate!; 24K from a 500K pot is 4.8%, and to get just that kind of dividend, (for example SPDR S&P Global Dividend Aristocrats UCITS ETF) you will be looking at stable blue chip stock where the stock price only grows at the rate of inflation.

Of course OP can try VOO, which pays out 1.18% in dividend, and he will have to sell some of his holding in VOO to make up the difference.

So, if OP wants to take out 4.8% and let say inflation is about 2.5% average, and  historically the S&P grows about 8 % per year, you can see that his pension pot does not grow that much after that.

Will the pension pot grow? Yes. Enough to retire on when he is 65? I dont really think so.

try this out, and you can see

You can get a ETF for diversity that’s 5%; Yeah, you answered your own question.  80/20 leverage on a fixed loan that can’t be called is what makes the returns much better. 

Dealing with renters and a property is a little work for sure, but not much; VOO 10 year average has been around 8-10%. Already a bad take. You’re in this for the long term, five year returns are not what you should be looking at.

You also have to take into account capital gains tax. You are not getting everything you take out. 

Down years in the market mean you will liquidate more equities. Liquidating between 2022 and 2023 would have set you back alot.

If you plan on living the activity level lifestyle of an 80 year old retiree as a healthy 45 year old, then maybe you can get by confining yourself to one million and never work again. But this is highly unrealistic. 

How about you retire at 45 on one million and document your life so we can watch you sit around and do nothing or watch you run out of money then have to go back to work at 60; Spy expense ratio is much higher; VOO better; Do you even understand what a dividend growth ETF (SCHD) is and what a S&P 500 tracking ETF (VOO) is? They are two totally different categories of ETFs. You are comparing apples to oranges.

SCHD pays you quarterly dividends with about 3.4% yield, so it will pay you $0.26/share at the end of each quarter. It only holds stocks of companies that pay consistent dividends. It's an income generating ETF, so the share price will never go up as much as something that tracks the S&P 500 which is made up of 34% tech companies and hence is doing good at the moment. SCHD dividends are also qualified dividends, so you pay less taxes compared to capital gains.

If you want growth and have high risk tolerance, then you should buy VOO, as when tech slumps VOO will slump bad, however, if you want consistent stable income that will keep increasing (irrespective of the share price) then invest in SCHD, as SCHD on average increased their dividend payout 8-10% per year.; I’ve done really well in SWPPX. I also have VOOG and SWPPX has outperformed it. To be fair I bought SWPPX during the bigger 2020 pandemic dip. I hadn’t chosen anything to stick my yearly retirement contribution into, so I picked SWPPX. I often wonder if I had chosen to split the money 50/50 which would be doing better? But I’m not wondering hard enough to run a simulation on it. 😂; most of my money is in SCHG. BKLC is another good one, QQQ of course. otherwise SCHB and SCHD along with SPY are all in rotation for me.; for stability.  the S&P 500 is very uneven and 30% is overweight to the magnificent 7 alone.  I think tech is gonna dominate for another 10 years, but it's not good risk for someone ready to retire.; Using $1,250 monthly you’d need to average 14% for 10 years, and using $1,000 you’d need to average 15%.  It’s not impossible, but pretty unlikely you will be able to achieve those return without taking some risks, which obviously comes with some downside.; That’s the sweet spot. Roth will make you a tax free millionaire if you pile money into it right.; Unless you plan to buy a ledger and hold the Bitcoin yourself probably best to just stick with IBIT or one of the other Bitcoin ETFs.

You pay a very small fee (I think 0.25%) for the ETF but it's worth it for most people to know they won't lose their Bitcoin to a hack.

There are also Ethereum ETFs now too. Long term Bitcoin will always be safer but maybe mix in 25% ETH ETF too for extra upside potential.; Fair enough, I know I'm not giving investment advice but you said open to anything so I thought I'd share. Do the math on adding a crew. Invest in a really aggressive marketing campaign and see if you can pull enough new properties to justify a crew. Invest in yourself was some of the best advice I was ever given. Just passing it along.

I'm an ETF guy anyway :); Sim. Trading helps you test your strategy with zero loss of capital … trading with out a strategy means you will be susceptible to emotions ..; It depends on where you live.  Where I live (Southern California) a mortgage is WAY more than rent.  I pay $3400 to rent a 4br/2ba.  Any decent (not sketchy neighborhood) condo in this area is $800k+ and then HOA on top ($250-350+).  With 20% down, the mortgage, HOA, prop taxes, and insurance you’re looking at $5k or more a month.  Even the mobile homes are going for $500k+ down here.  For a house—forget about it.  I’ve basically assumed I’ll never own a house down here unless someone dies and leaves us their house lol.; Because rent is still cheaper than a mortgage in 99% of cases. Also, it's easier to turn 100k into 200k than 1k into 100k. Why hit 100k and then have to start again?; Well you have taxes, insurance, and maintenance.  Those add up to be a lot.  Apartment landlords can distribute those costs across many tenants instead of one person being solely responsible for their house.  They can also skimp on maintenance altogether.

Having a single family home is a great lifestyle.  But as an investment one is lucky if they break even.  The only time you really come out ahead on a home is buying early in a hot market.; Why? 

If an 800k mortgage is $7k a month, why not invest money at 10% per year and rent a house for $3500?; This advice may not work in 2024 with a 6.5-7.5% mortgage rate; Why would you calculate that off 500k? I assume you handpicked that amount to fit your argument. This thread and OP in his comment above clearly assumes 1 million by the time he is 45. You pulled 500k out of your ass; Secret to retiring early is just to farm a bit.; I just took out a bunch of credit cards balance transfers check and then used the margin account to really load up.  That’s good leverage too.; You’re exposing yourself to lower growth over time, but you “understand” what you’re investing in, so all good.; Thoughts on SPYI?; I don't see it; A paid off house and 4,000 a month check in the mailbox/account sounds great to me at the age of 55-60 god willing; Agree. If I could push saving 2,000 a month that would help a lot in the long run; to be fair, investing in the S&P500 over the past 5 years would have been pretty close to matching that. A few fairly safe bets on companies with strong fundamentals would massively boost that.; That’s my goal is to try and max out my ROTH each year. I treat that as my personal 401k; Which etf’s are apart of your portfolio? I always stayed away from etf’s I guess because of the fees associated with them. Why I went with Warren buffet / BRKB since he has a basket of solid old man picks; You sure about that with 6.5-7.5% rates in 2025?; I agree it’s not easy but with some sacrifices when you’re young and if you can manage renting out a portion of your home such as a basement to help with the cost it will pay dividends in the long run. Landlords will make sure they are cash flow positive before buying a rental and include mortgage payments, taxes, maintenance and insurance in the rent and then some. Housing market is also hard to time because if prices are dropping then mortgage rates tend to be going up so the best time is to buy when you’re young and hold and build from the growing equity.; I got lucky and bought in the south before the great migration.  Up 100% from 2015; Which means it’s 24k annually from 1mil (which will continue to grow) so it’s actually 2.4%. Thanks for your contribution; You made another mistake in your calculation. You yourself assumed s&p growth of 8% a year so in 25 years 173 will actually become nearly 1.2mil …; No I did not. See the calculation. Where  are yours? 

[https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/financial-goals?s=y&sl=5ftqPp4swbiN86abXi05PQ](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/financial-goals?s=y&sl=5ftqPp4swbiN86abXi05PQ); lol; If you want growth, why stop at VOO. You are lowering YOUR growth by not investing in crypto. 

And VOO is not a growth stock anyways, the equivalent that you are looking for is VUG (Vanguard Growth) which will grow even faster than VOO. VUG is up 37% YTD and VOO is up 26% YTD.; It's actually really good for income. Pays around 11.5% dividend which is really good, and the dividends are also qualified so are taxed as normal capital gains and not as normal income. However, the share price does not appreciate much. Question is how long they can sustain this high dividend yield, since the estimated payout coming up on 12/22 is $0.4849/share compared to $0.5206 that it paid in November. So, it is already trending down.; Where are you getting $4,000 a month from?; Sure, as long as there are no years with huge pull backs.  Remember you need a 25% increase just to offset a 20% loss (like we had in 2022), so all it would take is one or two bad years to make a 14-15% average over 10 years unachievable.  The shorter the time frame, the more you are ""gambling"", hoping for good results with no bad results mixed in.; I'm Canadian, and my picks are specific to Canadian markets, but I split between 3. One tracks the S&P500, one tracks the NASDAQ, and one is globally diversified with a 20% Canadian bias. You can find American versions of all of these recommended all over Reddit.; Global X and Vanguard has solid ETF’s; Please share your calculation, as OP said, in 10 years he wants to take 2K per month. Using the Monte Carlo simulation, the 8% growth = 500K, and after 30% it is 750000

Using a contribution of 1K per month for the next 10 year, the taking out 2 k per month after (including inflation adjustment) 

[https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/financial-goals?s=y&sl=5ftqPp4swbiN86abXi05PQ](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/financial-goals?s=y&sl=5ftqPp4swbiN86abXi05PQ); The title says 20-25 years, but if he wants the mil in 10 years and retire early then he needs somewhere between 19-20% in annual gains, which is very doable; Hey there, relax.  I make one comment and you launch into some vitriol lol. Again, if you already understand all that, all good.; If I could flip my portfolio into a dividend paying portfolio in 15-20 years and live off the dividends each month would be my ultimate goal.; No the title says 

>My goal is to reach $1 million or retire by 45

the important bit is OR. So either the stock market needs to perform at 15% every single year for the next 10 years, which I do not find that do-able at all OR he hits 45 with a more conservative return of 8 to 10 percent, which means that the pot is between 500 to 700K. 

So where are you pulling the 20% S&P 500 returns from?; $4,000 a month might be a bit ambitious depending on your local/federal taxes.  You’d need about 5% dividends with no taxes.  You’ll also need to factor in inflation over your 40 - 60 year retirement.

Good luck brother, I hope you manage to do it.  As a fellow construction worker, it’s hard on your body, and an early retirement would be great; Thanks brother 👍🏻 4,000 is shooting for the moon.  I’ll take 2,000 and be very happy if it was a dividend"

For example, don't hold a 0dte for more than 2 hours, don't hold a weekly more than a day, and don't hold a monthly more than a week. Also, sell whenever the price of the stock reaches your initial breakeven price (strike price plus premium paid) and start a new position if you think it's going to keep going up.

That’s unsustainable in the long run. 4 of the 5 largest numbers on her trades were losses. It’s almost always better to have a lower win rate with small losses than it is to have a higher win rate but large losses. This feels like beginners luck. She’s not going to be able to maintain that kind of win rate on a consistent basis. And if her system is allowing losses that are consistently larger than most of her wins, she needs a very high win rate to avoid losing money.; Make friends with her boyfriend?; Get out now and pay down some debt with the three grand; First one is free, quit after the first one ; she is the god of options trading and should burn it all on weeklys; She's gonna need more pink highlighters.; Cash out the 3k, use that as your options fund.

As for PLTR calls.  The 80C has good chance of hitting.  The 87C I'm guessing was just because that's how much purchasing power she had left to use.

LEAPS Golden cross/Death Cross strategy question,"I have an idea for a strategy that requires quite a bit of time to do. I’m not sure if this is already a strategy so my bad if it is.

it’s self explanatory but waiting for a golden cross (or death cross) and buying a LEAPS.

I was basically wondering what are some issues with this strategy if anyone’s tried something similar, apart from the obvious like the lagging affect because it’s an AVERAGE indicator…that’s obvious and is a very glaring issue but has anyone tried this strategy and found ways to get around the lag? or is this strategy just not viable if not paired with other indicators/TA

the reason i thought about this was growth stocks like meta, apple, google and most recently costco had golden crosses and have gone up so high. costcos last golden cross was at like $887 or so and it’s now trading at \~$980 to $1000.

Obviously the longer you let a LEAPS run solely based off an AVERAGE indicator, the more risk your taking on cause it could very well cause a late exit and loss in profit. but what about doing maybe a month of price movement, and exiting?

would a golden cross LEAPS strategy not be viable? why or why not? i’d love to hear everyone’s thoughts!",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1heib5t/leaps_golden_crossdeath_cross_strategy_question/,0,2024-12-15 02:56:17,"

[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse); my thoughts are:

1.) you used soooo many words it implies you not only expect us to read, you believe we can

2.) if this regarded idea is a way you can use to help you specifically overcome the buy high sell low strategy many in wsb implement then the chances of you contributing loss porn are much lower and that may be a personal win, but it’s a loss to this community; https://preview.redd.it/958ho7uwmx6e1.jpeg?width=200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9c2ac9fabbb50bcc07aff30c384adaddac392296; As no one explained it to me I had to look it up.


So a golden cross is literally just a recent increase in shareprice.


So what you try to say is: stock just went up so it will go up more thus I buy call.


Which is literally the most basic thing one could do in a stock market requiring 0 understanding of markets or business.


But you phrased in such a way to make it seem new.; It's easy to fool yourself into thinking golden crosses work because you're always looking at it in hindsight in stocks that have done well. I've fallen for this many times and I realised that's what I'm doing wrong. I look at successful stocks and thinking like oh there was a golden cross, that must work. But of course they had a golden cross, these are some of the best performing stocks.

I'd use it more as a clue to dig deeper into its price history and fundamentals and any other TA you understand. Use TA to convince yourself that it has growth left in it, but back it up with fundamentals to justify the movement.; Wtf is a golden cross?; I’ve thought of this before, it’s good to backtest extensively and see how many times it’s worked and how many times it hasn’t. I would probably go out a year on most of them, that way i can capture more of the move and give it time. Also only look for crosses on the daily timeframe or weekly even that’ll probably give you the best chance of having a successful trade; Indicators are often not as shallow as they seem. The golden cross is not just a recent change in price, it's a sustained medium term change in price, enough so to cross the long term price average. 200/50/20 day sma/ema changes with each day change, so the 50 day moving moving average is contained within the 200 day moving average as well. I.e. When the price changes both the 200 and 50 day average changes with it. 

But given that 50 day average is fairly medium term, this suggests it's not just accelerated growth, but sustained growth. If the 50 day averages approaches 200 day average and stays there it suggests the price is returning after a surge or slump to its previous ""stable"" price point. But if it crosses, it means there is underlying sentiment/fundamentals to suggest its value is higher/lower now than it was for a long time

Of course other factors matter. How much change it has had before and after crossing the 200 day has to be considered. Sometimes if most of the change  is already priced in it can just overshoot a bit and return, and conversely if it was already close to the 200 day and moves to cross, then it could just be a short term fluctuation 

In a way you are right but it's an important moment in a stocks history but must also be considered with other indicators and history to draw conclusions; well uh no. 

it’s an average over time. in this case the golden cross is something longer term investors pair with other indicators to signal bullish momentum. this is cause the average over the last 50 days has started increasing. this shows its bullish over an average time. 

if it crosses above the 200 that’s even better cause now it means that the 50 days prior has now beaten the last 200 days of price movement. showing that price is infact, going up. 

so yes. price go up so i must buy call cause price go up more. 

but the golden cross is a signal that price has started going up after 50 days of downward price action. and the current price is now beating the price 50 days ago and so on. 

something to keep in mind aswell u mentioned that golden crosses can be interpreted as bearish. and yes thats kind of true?

it depends cause if you let price come down and retest it, and it bounces back up, congrats cause u found a golden cross that’s providing support now. 

however if it breaks the cross, thennnnnn yea don’t touch it until it can support price. 

so yes it COULD be bearish…as could any AVERAGE indicator. the main thing is waiting for it to come down, retest, and prove its supporting. if it can’t…then no. don’t buy in. 

that’s the whole concept of indicators based on averages.; One of the schools of Hokuto Shinken; While you are right that it's not a 1 day moving average but a 50 day moving average and thus maybe midterm it still does not impact what I said.


A golden cross could also be interpreted as a bearish sign as something just having spikes recently means it might just go down to its 200 day moving average again.; 'providing support' 😂


I can't even with all that.


Ok have fun with your astrology I'll continue to focus on investing in good business models and using makroeconomics.; Wtf is a Hokuto Shinken?; You're using the term ""recently"" quite loosely. MA for one doesn't register the shortest term spikes. If the 50 day MA crosses the 200 day, the 20 day has already crossed much earlier. Which is why 20 crossing 200 doesn't mean as much as 50 crossing 200. That refers to speed or response speed of these indicators. A consistent price increase for 50 days shows its not responding to some hype, or news or crap like that, it indicates there's a substantial change in its intrinsic value

It's a bullish signal, but possibly a reason to be bearish. Indicators are meant to give you clues not conclusions. 50 crossing 200, with consistent volume, if price targets are above 200 day, if the stock is not overpurchased, and other oscillators give you confidence that growth rate isn't slowing down can all give you confidence that there is some growth still left in it.

Anyone can tell when a stock is going up, the golden cross tells you more than that; dude what 😂

it’s not astrology it’s literally an average indicator. 

how the fuck is something taking an AVERAGE a complete guess. 

fun fact ur macroeconomics (which u misspelled btw) mostly use AVERAGES cause taking single pieces of data doesn’t mean shit. Every balance sheet u look at has averages tied to it and percentages. every company you probably buy into, you most likely look into AVERAGE ROI. or you may look at a P/E ratio which is an AVERAGE. 

the MA 50 and MA200 is an AVERAGE. 

idk how this is going over ur head as much as it is lmao; Sounds like japanese ham; What are you talking about?


Yes they are averages. I never said they are not. They are recent trends compared to slightly less recent trends.


Them crossing means nothing other than it having increased more recently than before.; ""Them crossing means nothing other than it having increased more recently than before.""

yea................that's the point

they have increased more recently than before......meaning they are.......stay with me now.......becoming more bullish compared to previously. Isnt that exactly what a trend reversal is????

the crossing itself doesn't PROVE its becoming more bullish as it could also cross again and continue the trend. Its a signal that it COULD be.

the entire strategy banks and hedge funds use for MA is using it as support and resistance because if price CANT break above the MA then that means price ISNT doing better than the previous average.

once again the crossing doesn't prove anything. its a signal that ""oh shit it might be reversing"" and you wait for it to come touch down and if it holds then nice you found a good support line...this is the entire concept of every strategy reliant on price movement.

cool. it broke resistance. but will the resistance hold.

the golden cross and death cross is no different than support and resistance levels or supply and demand zones. you use them as a signal, then let them prove its stable, then enter a position."
Everyone's confused why NVDA didn't pump after AVGO earnings. Could the market realize that AVGO is actually a serious threat to NVDA?,"This post is meant to raise discussion. I'm hoping individuals knowledgeable on the semiconductor landscape can weigh in (specifically on NVDA's GPUs vs AVGO's XPUs/ASICs for AI workloads).

From CNBC, [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/12/broadcom-avgo-earnings-report-q4-2024-.html:](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/12/broadcom-avgo-earnings-report-q4-2024-.html:)

https://preview.redd.it/giaf186pav6e1.png?width=765&format=png&auto=webp&s=eab86a7885cfb8dca492184466962c3e46fa4b57

NVDA is currently able to charge astronomical prices for its GPUs due to lack of viable alternative chips (Blackwell margins are estimated to be \~70%). Based on my readings, companies have started seeking alternatives to NVDA's GPUs to avoid dumping hundreds of billions in capex into NVDA's pockets every year.

NVDA's customer base only consists of a handful of large tech companies, which means there is very likely overlap between AVGO's 3 'very large customers' and NVDA's (Apple is confirmed as one of those very large customers). Relative to NVDA GPUs, AVGO's ASICs are cheaper and more energy efficient but more difficult to deploy, so companies are turning to ASICs as a longer term solution for their AI data centers while continuing to rely on NVDA in the near term.

That being said, could this mean that AVGO poses a material threat to NVDA in the mid to long term? It seems like a natural conclusion if customers are actually turning to Broadcom for a long term solution to NVDA's exorbitant prices. Even after NVDA's slight dip, it's still a top 3 market cap company valued at $3.3T on \~$60B annual income, so it's still priced for perfection in terms of earnings growth. Which means if AVGO were to threaten NVDA's market share (and consequently its margins as NVDA will not be able to charge w/e it wants with viable competition) in \~3 years, that earnings growth needed to justify NVDA's massive valuation won't materialize. 

The counter point I've read is that NVDA and AVGO are not direct competitors. That NVDA GPUs will still be in high demand as they are flexible and can perform a variety of AI tasks, unlike ASICs. So NVDA's addressable market is not threatened. I've been unable to verify the validity of this claim and am hoping experts can weigh in.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hec4pn/everyones_confused_why_nvda_didnt_pump_after_avgo/,144,2024-12-14 21:48:39,"# **TLDR**

**Ticker:** NVDA, AVGO

**Direction:**  Uncertain, but potentially bearish for NVDA long-term.

**Prognosis:**  AVGO's XPUs might be a serious threat to NVDA's GPU dominance in the AI market, potentially impacting NVDA's future earnings growth and high valuation.  The market may be underestimating this risk.

**Bonus:**  AVGO's projected market opportunity for AI chips by 2027 is HUGE ($60B-$90B)!  That's a lot of potential market share for NVDA to lose.

**Meme Potential:** NVDA's 70% margins are looking less ""astronomical"" and more ""about to be significantly threatened"".; It is not pumping because I finally bought 100 NVDA shares few weeks ago. I even have another CSP open now. You NVDA buls are fuk.; Watch Jensen announce high-performance AI chips during CES Keynote next month.; Just buy both; Nvidia's Mellanox acquisition is the most goated move NVIDIA ever made. Nobody will be able to scale AI fabrics like Nvidia can without NVLinks superiority and interconnect.

GPU + NVLINK + CUDA + Libraries = vertically stacked business

Add in the Grace CPU on top where they can. 

Broadcom can supply chips it doesn't matter. Nvidia supplies the entire solution.; Because in the market nothing makes sense, that’s why you will lose money using logic; I bought Nvidia calls and it hasn’t gone up again since. My bad.; AVGO and NVDA really won’t be seen as competitors but more complimentary.  NVDA’s very long term play is the platform (CUDA) with the hardware as a means. So more GPUs out there isn’t a bad thing since the industry will need to consolidate a bit to avoid the specialization problems of COBOL and FORTRAN that exist in the mainframe market space still.

On the flip side though coming out of AWS re:invent, everyone has basically made their company an “AI company” but when VPs were queried in a round table, while everyone said they were working on AI solutions, very few said they were in production.  What we’re coming to find out is everyone is baking a lot currently, but the release cadence isn’t there.  There’s been a rush to get out solutions, but the efficacy isn’t being measured appropriately so garbage gets released more often than not that needs to get pulled back. 

Developing on cloud is expensive so solutions from AVGO are going to be great for long term on prem development - to control costs - while NVDA will still be the consumer cloud scale beast for those actual production workloads.

We’re in the early stages where we are past the introduction but where companies need to take a moment to get things under control before shooting for the real apex and gaining speed.  Once the cost story, quality control, and governance are really streamlined, this thing will take off even faster and further.; No one was confused, they aren't really competitors, AVGO doing good or bad isn't going to cause NVDA to rise or fall. The opposite can be true, NVDA is so big that when it's pumping, it tends to bring up the other chip stocks. Much like when BTC does well, it brings up the rest of crypto. NVDA is the long play, buy it and hold it for a few years.; Nvidia has CUDA; TSMC doing alright tho….; ITS A 3.5 TRILLION DOLLAR COMPANY ; 1 word:  CUDA; You’re completely right.

I see Nvidia in a correction phase right now, but I’m confident it will bounce back next week. As for Broadcom, I think it’s set to pump even further, especially after the positive expectations from the earnings call.

The funny part? People think the market is overheated and start shorting both stocks (and even Tesla) assuming market makers are doing the same. But here’s the twist—they try to “read” the market makers and end up losing money almost every time. On the other hand, those with access to order flow tools and some solid research make consistent gains, leaving everyone else wondering if they’re magicians.; Nvidia's lead will take years for AVGO to catch up to, and their bottleneck is currently based on supply, not demand. So just fundamentally, Nvidia's position isn't going to be threatened for a few years at least. Sure, AVGO's market share may grow, but it's virtually not going to have any impact on Nvidia's prices or growth rate.

Not even taking into account CUDA, which makes migrating existing codebases away from Nvidia cards harder, and in as tight of a race as AI is right now, I really doubt that any of the current big names are going to bounce and lose short term progress, even if it was beneficial in the long term. That basically locks in most current AI companies except for who? Amazon, Apple, 1 other?

The real winner here, unambiguously, is the Fabs. You can develop as many custom AI chips as you want, but if you can't produce enough of them to sell to your customers, it won't matter. Developing the facilities and workforce needed to produce the chips at scale takes billions.; I'm in at 85 avg cost.

Why? Seemed like a great opportunity to buy a couple years ago a company with massive potential that had not yet really taken off like many of its peers. Bought a similar amount of QCOM at the same time for same reason. And recently, a few months ago upped my position in AMZN wondering why they were lagging others. Those last 2 with really nice gains but no super pump yet. 

Will any pump like NVDA? Who knows. But once a stock is done sucking the oxygen from the room, others get to breathe. 

The next big with multibag potential play? Looking at HON and their quantum tech.; ASICs and CUDA GPUs involve separate languages and therefore separate environments.; Not really competitors from what I understand.  Whether the market understands that though remains to be seen.  You think the old greybeards even understand the internet let alone the intricacies of AI chips? ; Because MM wanted to make sure all NVDA calls expire worthless. It’ll pump next week.; Knowledgeable? The fuck is that ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276); Remind me in 2 years if Brodcom managed to DEVELOPS new AI chips. By then Nvidia, AMD, Intel or others might have even better AI chips then Broadcom.; Sector rotation? maybe a large nasdaq funding name? Was a weird move on Friday.; Except it’s not a threat and the money will flow from AVGO into NVDA very soon once that fantasy blows over. Don’t get me wrong, AVGO is a huge success and will continue to dominate. But bulls got carried away and priced in “NVDA is being dethroned” which is absolutely not going to happen. Wouldn’t be surprised to see AVGO cool off (not sink) in the coming weeks while NVDA pumps to 150 after all is digested.; Looking at ratio charts makes moves like this make more sense imo.

Layers of ratios…SMH all besides recently outperformed QQQ and then QQQ outperformed SPY.  Both NVDA and AVGO greatly outpaced SMH the leader of the 3 major indexes.

So if you want to look at a comparison of the leaders of those you can then look at NVDA/AVGO on TradingView instead of looking at both charts individually as dollar ratio.

I like to swing trade on 3day candle chart.  AVGO/NVDA chart hit it’s rsi low oversold pivot back in March 2020 on 3day chart and triple topped late 2022/early 2023 at around a 4/1 ratio 4NVDA shares per 1 NVDA.  This top also had confluence with 3day 200SMA after a 3day death cross confirmation down trend.

Using rsi on the ratio chart same as you would other usd ratio charts you can see as ratio fell in downtrend rsi has held higher low uptrend and bottomed right above a 1/1 ratio and now those traders that bought 1 AVGO for 4NVDA decided it is a good time to swap some back and reposition into the next leader in a sector.

But most would say TA doesn’t work so I am sure you fundamentallies makes sense of that price action.; It might not be pumping because of China's investigation into Nvidia.; Its like comparing cars and locomotives. They both move stuff on wheels, but that’s kinda where the similarities end.

NVDA is overpriced IMO, but the competition is going to come from cloud providers: Anthropic is starting using Amazon AI chips, Google has TPUs (Apple used TPU as well), and Microsoft is not far behind with their own chips.; People confused about why NVDA not pumping while MM are selling calls and puts in an even amount.

NVDA got too popular. Optimistic bulls and hopeful bears both get slaughtered.; **Long-term: AVGO**

If the application of large language models (LLMs) continues to grow and major players shift focus from improving their models to running inference, it will signify that the promise of AI is being realized. In such a scenario, these companies will aim to minimize inference costs. To achieve this, they will collaborate with AVGO to design custom chips. The cost of programming custom chips to support deep learning frameworks like PyTorch is not prohibitive. For example, Google’s TPUs are already supported by multiple ML frameworks. Similarly, companies like Meta, OpenAI, and Amazon will not face significant hurdles in developing their own software to support their custom chips.

**Short-term: NVDA**

We are still in the early stages of AI development. Most major AI organizations are focused on improving their models, conducting experiments, and pursuing research. Currently, none of these companies have established a profitable AI product offering. Furthermore, many new companies are likely to emerge, focusing on innovative AI products. In the near future (within the next 2 to 3 years), NVIDIA will remain the preferred choice for these entities. Indie developers and smaller companies developing custom ML solutions will continue to use CUDA/ NVIDIA’s hardware ecosystem.; What is xpu?; [removed]; I mean one of the stocks is up basically 100% this year and the other was up as high as 200%. So there's that; That’s why I like smh the whole sector is red hot the next decade nvidia won’t be the only winner; Buddy been pumping for 2 years. He’s taking a break; Sell sell sell; I’m bagholding nvda here… next earnings is probably not great because of the platform transition but afterwards the magnitudes of beats should be. The problem is the stock is priced for like 10% beats on guidance every time and if it doesnt happen we just stay in a range; So will it pump???; broadcom announcement is for inference chips, not training chips; If INTC and AMD (companies developing compute products for decades) failed to eat into nVidia's AI pie in a significant way, why do you think, that AVGO would be able to? It is not the only company offering specialized/ASIC solutions, either.

OK, I've read a bit more about the Broadcom XPU and it seems it expects the customer to supply the logic, i.e. a completely different business model from nVidia/INTC/AMD (though AMD does offer some customization, such as the Playstation/XBox chips). This seems to be aimed at companies deploying finalized AI products.

This is not at all suitable for research & development, or companies/people merely playing around with AI, trying stuff. The kind of things people have been buying nVidia HW for.; TSMC will fabricate chips for both NVDA and AVGO; Nobody’s confused; only you!; JBL is a threat ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); Market likes to pump whenever however she likes.;

No it isn't a threat to NVDA. NVDA's MC is just so high that expecting it to just crank all day every day is stupid as hell.; Just buy $SMH. Way too hard to pick the winners and losers long term but long term trend is obvious.; what happens when nvidia big clients make their own in-house GPUs similar to nvidia quality? everyone is saying it's a long way to go but google has that quantum chip and other tech giants have giant r&d budgets ; NVDA is far too overhyped as is, that’s why.; Bro I’m in the same boat as you, I picked up 100 shares at 137.

This is going down hard next week guaranteed. Buy evem one weekly put on Monday; Rubin is coming next.; I bought some cheap 1.5 QQQ calls for CES on Friday. Hoping that’s the smart play. I bought some cheaper ones for money destroyer as well. AMD built my account from the run up a few years back, let’s see if they’ll do it again; New six month cadence!; The only correct answer. It’s impossible to predict who will win the race, might as well buy all of the front runners: NVDA, AVGO, and AMD.; How do you go balls deep then?; Buy fselx and smh; Fr SOXX exists for a reason; Yes, you are 100% correct! I see so many people posting about the next Nvidia because of some new chip a company is making. They entirely miss the point that the chip is just one piece! People don't understand the importance of CUDA and how support for Nvidia GPUs via CUDA is baked into so all ML/AI libraries at this point. Even if someone magically created a new chip that beat Nvidia's best, all of these libraries will need to be updated to support this new chip and that is not just some quick task. There will not be a new Nvidia that magically shows up. It will take years of development and community support before anyone can even come close.

You summed it up perfectly. Nvidia supplies the entire solution.; NVLink is in the node only, for large scale-out you want infiniband. Until a few months ago Infiniband couldnt scale well past 65000 gpus so AWS and Meta used Ethernet, as do most large of customers. So they buy Arista/Cisco switches instead. UEC is a superset of Infiniband features with the scalability/efficiency and cost advantage that nvidia can't provide. Additionally AVGO will have available optical on package platform years ahead of nvidia. Custom ASICs don't need CUDA so, evidently 3 ""large"" customers do not care for it. Probably because writing your own custom kernels for custom asic is better. GPU still provides flexibility, buts that's about it at this point.; IYKYK 👍; For training that's important. For inference not so much, you don't split a single inference request that costs a few cents across multiple racks.; And that's why antitrust issues be popping; U; Logically AVGO should have a short term pullback after pumping 24% in a single day, but that makes too much sense. So I should buy puts. But this market is irrational so calls would be an obvious inverse play, but since I just mentioned that on this subreddit and inverse WSB is the strongest force in the universe, I think puts is definitely the move.; Visualizing the win for you! Good luck!; Same here; Good idea to buy AVGO puts ?; Glad to see not everyone here is a regard. CUDA is by far NVIDIA’s biggest moat; IBM has Linux.  ORCL has Java.  Both not utilized.; I think we’re going to see a major shift here and CUDA is going to become less and less important for most workloads. The market is flooded with both small and large companies going after specialized inference chips. 95% of use cases in AI are or will be inference. Inference is the “how do I actually use AI” part of the equation.

I think we will continue to see NVDA dominate in training workloads where their stack will shine - computer, networking and software.

But imagine you want to simply consume models in the enterprise. Meaning you want the chat bot, document summarization, or whatever else your use case is for GenAI with models like llama. Maybe not real time video just yet. You ideally want the best bang for your buck. That might mean most energy efficient or without the bells and whistles. Inference is that use case.

I think it’s coming fast.

'The total semiconductor market was up 19.9% for this period. Excluding the memory companies, the remainder of the semiconductor market was up only 6.8%.

Not on my watch spunk.; AMD? 😂; Will you play catch with me; Yes, but chips with improvements in inference are likely going to target the lower cost segment being the users of models.

Fundementals tell you to not be too exposed to stocks in general, and certainly not Growth only, and certainly not one industry. So fundementals would say diversify with some gold, bonds, value stocks, CDs, treasuries, crypto, art, collectables, etc.; I don't think so 🤷‍♂️ it's the way of the future. You have good picks 👌; Im in the same boat and I got this advice from a friend recently. Investing heavily in one sector is dangerous for a few reasons, the most obvious one is that is could be a bubble that will pop at any time and you lose everything, or it isn’t a bubble and continues to grow exponentially but with that you likely have the scenario of a few certain stocks far outperforming the rest and with you being so far spread out, it somewhat makes it closer to a net zero in the end, with some stocks being exponential gains and others, losses. 

With that advice I’ve chosen just to focus on the big players, IONQ, RGTI etc. Whether or not that will pay off, no body knows, just as likely a small player will have some breakthrough and end up dominating. I don’t see it being a bubble though. Guess we’ll see 😃; The AI sector is strong, and Nasdaq also looks good. It’s reasonable to aim for the best possible returns.

Finally, the raw amount of money in the global economy is just genuinely insane. 

15 years ago I couldn't transfer my AUD to yen and purchase a stock by just pressing ""buy"". We are in a time where people are sick and tired of everyone else fucking with their money, and many are taking investing into their own hands.; probably, every year sp500 going up like 20-30% which is just insane lmao"

Broadcom has a decrease in operating income for 2024 compared to TTM. This appears to be attributable to increased operating expenses, likely due to its acquisition of VMWare last year, although I'd appreciate if someone with more experience can confirm this.

Really useful for my rebalancing move next year.; I don’t have any input other than these numbers show how ridiculous TSLA is. Completely decoupled from reality. 

PE that is literally 4x all the others despite having the least operating income and the smallest margins. It won’t be today, and it won’t be tomorrow, but it will crash eventually.; GOOGL seems cheap; It's a remarkable feat to see 8 US companies have broken the $1 trillion barrier. This should give other regions like Europe and China pause for thought, although for Tesla and Broadcom the valuation multiple seems quite optimistic to say the least.; In my opinion, the day people stop shorting TSLA and accept that it's impossible to beat his cult is when TSLA tanks. Don't give them free money with your puts.; Kinda weird seeing AVGO valued at a higher multiple than Nvidia; $1T for $15B in operating income and $52B in revenue HAHA.; Thank you this is v helpful!; Just keep stacking them.  
I don't like TSLA but no point fighting Elon.; Macrotrends has incorrect information for Google’s operating margin. CNBC and Gurufocus have it at ~30%.  It’s definitely over 30% just from looking at the Alphabet investor relations ERs. It was 27% in Q2 2022 to Q1 2023 but not anymore. 

For some reason the operating margin numbers for Meta and Microsoft and Apple are consistent. But they are not consistent across websites for Nvidia and AVGO and Google. Maybe it’s just outdated numbers? 

Google had 32.2% operating margin in Q3 2024. They also report that they expect continued margin expansion. I believe that AVGO and NVDA stated they expect stable margins. 

I see Google margins in 2025 surpassing 35%. Mostly due to severance and relegated office space from 2023-2024 falling off the balance sheet completely.; Table updated to reflect new Macrotrends data, mostly for AVGO Q3 earning report calculations.; AVGO versus Nvidia is wild.; Remember folks, valuation doesn’t matter. Growth matters; Can you add Amd Walmart Costco Xom Lly?; The PE from AVGO and NVDA is not showing the whole picture. They are profiting from insanely high margins and hype (imo). They face much much much higher risk than Apple or Microsoft or Google; One thing really stands out for me regarding this list. Each of the companies listed produces something of value, with the exception of Broadcom.

Broadcom buys companies, leeches off customers and money, and ultimately lets the product die. They have a horrible reputation among their clients but keep them as it is frequently too difficult to move off. Definitely not a company i would ever invest into.; TSLA P/E standing out like an ugly step-sister LOL; [deleted]; > Completely decoupled from reality.

The ""momentum factor"" is strong with this one. Everyone can be a gangster in a raging bull market, but at some point (hopefully not for a while), the market will enter a correction or worse, and fundamentals will matter. I wouldn't want to be left holding the bag then.

> PE that is literally 4x all the others despite having the least operating income and the smallest margins.

Not only that, but it's also got the worst growth curve.; it crashed many times before.... but it always comes back up higher lol; Literally my first thought was that based on these numbers TSLA is so out of place.; >PE that is literally 4x all the others despite having the least operating income and the smallest margins.

Add to that it being the ""most at risk"" company. In a few years, Chinese EVs will wipe the floor with Tesla outside of the US.; Lol people have been saying this about Tesla for years. It is a major meme stock of the bets shills; The PE here is Presidency Entitlement. It is a infinite multiplier; “TSLA is a tech company” 

oh wait so are the rest of them.; My thinking is, it will either crash... Or eventually it's earnings will grow enough for it to make sense at the current level. 

They'd have to get their robotics to work first.; I keep saying it, TSLA is the perfect example of a company worth exactly how much people are willing to pay. I personally think their software is dogshit, but it's a solid platform. I'd never own one personally. The only thing that will bring that shit down is changing people's mind that Elon is some sort of genius at EVERYTHING. It's like peak Apple hype but worse. It didn't start loosing some of its shine until Steve Jobs died. I'm hoping Elon forgets Trump doesn't usually like not being the center of attention it seems and gets curb stomped for trying to over play in the political space.; Orange guy will take care of other stocks so that TSLA can’t crash.; Couldn’t agree more, recently sold out of my position at 40% profits, selling point at 425 and I couldn’t be happier. Idc if it goes up another 200% , it feels good to be able to say my portfolio is based off of fundamentals and not mass hysteria.; They’ve been saying that for 10 years bro; I agree. Willow got all the recent hype and some backlash because quantum computing won’t necessarily be coming in the next year, but Google will continue to print money for the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, I don’t think most people realize how talented their researchers and engineers are. Multiple Nobel Laureates in Physics and Chemistry this year had affiliations with Google.; What’s cheap about it is that the forward earnings estimates assume a constant operating margin when in reality Google’s operating margin will spike above 35% in 2025 due to severance and relegated office costs all falling off the balance sheet.

The analysts typically use trailing operating margin since it’s difficult to forecast margin growth. They think Google will spike CapEx for datacenters significantly again, while I don’t think it’ll be as much. 

You can see this in the 2025 estimate of $105b income even with revenue growing at 14%. Trailing $340b revenue multiplied by 1.14 = $388b in 2025. 

$388b times 0.27 margin = $105b 

However, margin in Q3 2024 was 32%. Now let’s assume that you get just 32% in 2025, $130b income. 35% margin? $140b.; Very.   They are set up really well for what is coming in the next decade.

Google is a screaming buy, IMHO.; Probably the risk of the company getting broken up in the various antitrust lawsuits; The Willow announcement and the Gemini 2.0 announcement pushed it up recently. 

It was around 20 or under 20 not long ago.; * number wise agree. 
* quick glance wise agree. Lots of thing going for them, cloud, self-driving, quantum chips, chrome, adnroid etc. 

However 2 looming risk. 1) short term monopoly law suit. This is the least of the 2 concerns, 2) bigger risk is that their bread and butter despite everything that is going on is search.  And with LLM there is finally since their IPO some real competition and threat, not saying that they will lose in terms of search but that its a real threat despite years of ""google killers"" non has come even remotely close.  Anecdotally my google search has probably drop at least 50%.; It is, buy now before Trump reverses everything Lina Kahn ever touched. It will pop when it's out of the crosshairs.; GOOG is cheaper for good reasons/risks. Their legacy search engine business is at risk long term because only old people Google. Then you have regulatory and antitrust risk. 

I realize that yes it prints money currently. But their smaller business segments will need to become much more meaningful long term.; China is too authoritarian, Europe is too regulated and lacks a combination of cheap energy, high end talent, and population growth. It's tough to see a path where those other regions ever catch the US.; China has numerous companies which make more net income than everyone on this list. 

They just are State Owned.; I remember similar thing said in first half of 2023 about nvidia.

I believe is not about current revenue , but about the future. Once the revenue realized, all valuation comes down; If you have a suggested source that I can use to obtain operating margins for all eight stocks for TTM, I can switch to that when I make my edit.; Growth doesn't matter either

Tesla isn't growing; RemindMe! 6 months; Do it yourself with chatgpt; Broadcom has surged due to their custom silicon business booming. Google is paying more money, Broadcom just added several other major customers, and has said these customers might increase their spending up to 8x in the next 3 years. 

Despite the VMware negativity they’re already making money 3 years ahead of schedule. Seems like vendor lock in is a thing and they probably get most of the revenue from a few big customers. I don’t think Redditors complaining about VMware is reflective of the success Broadcom is having.

Hock Tan is a killer. He’s a ruthless business man that might not care much about customer satisfaction but he knows how to make money and Broadcom will continue to run as long as he’s at the wheel (at least until 2027).; I think you’re conflating value in the subjective sense to the consumer and value in the capitalistic sense.

For instance, I think Meta Platforms is the poster child for terminal enshittification with pretty much all their products and acquisitions having gotten worse for the end user since they went public. I’ve personally moved away from all their products except WhatsApp, and only LLaMa seems the slightest bit appealing. That being said, I can’t deny that their balance sheet looks fantastic and that the stock is probably a solid investment.; How?; It's the corruption trade. The only reason for Tesla to be going up right now is if investors are expecting completely rampant corruption within the Trump admin, with Musk given free reign to use the government to benefit Tesla and attack his opponents. 

Which is of course what everyone with two functioning brain cells expects.; Musk is the greatest manipulator. His 44b Twitter buy turned into a brilliant investment for him which returned ten fold with the election.; Growth scoliosis; It's also embedded with the next administration, who will coddle it the next 4 yrs and keep the game going.; They're the stock embodiment of that Chumbawumba song.; You're just looking at the PE against its peers what you need to be looking at is it's PE over historical

Yes it trades rich but it pretty much always trades rich; Their dependence on Chinese sales itself is an issue. They are increasingly becoming a brand with quality issues in an industry that does require a great deal of word of mouth marketing.; If Trump raises China tariffs, China says hippityhoppity Tesla Shanghai is now my property; What US president is going to remove the tariffs on Chinese EVS and when is china going to make USA-compliant cars?; >  It's like peak Apple hype but worse.

Look how that worked out...?; I remember the Apple hype. Whatever happened to that overhyped shit company, it must have finally crashed after it lost its shine ; Meanwhile TSLA at 141. Ooof.; Worth mentioning, Google also has access to data on a scope that few companies can rival; It will be super stupid for the US government to break up Google and lose one of the most important AI innovation hub of US; I’ll lever back up when it dips below $180 in a few weeks as is typical; Only old people use Google? Completely untrue/outlandish statement.; these normie takes are why the average stock picker underperforms the market; > Their legacy search engine business is at risk long term because only old people Google. 

Is there some sort of AI bot network and/or confederacy of ""puts-holders"" that have unified to push this absolutely nonsensical viewpoint?; Chinese companies make lots of money, but their valuations are shit because no one wants to invest in them, because they can get banhammered by poohbear anytime.; Except NVDA has a higher profit margin, lower debt to capital ratio, and a PEG ratio half of AVGO. Could keep going but... lots of people don't care about these sort of things on here.; Cars would never have the same demand as GPUs like in 2023-24 and still has insane demand.
Nvda is a monopoly. More than 90% of the marketshare, the only competitor is AMD which is miles away from nvda.

And also I would always trust Jensen's promises over Elon's promises any day.; If you have $1T sitting in the bank and put it into a company that will give you $15B a year with the hopes of high growth, then I’m not sure what to tell you. 

A HYSA would give you $50B a year.; But that was right after Chatgpt was released and it was clear what a big deal LLMs would be in the future. And it was powered by Nvidia GPUs.; Nvidia was a great company in 2022.; Nah it’s okay. I just wanted to point out that the source you use seems to have different timelines for different companies. Seems like AVGO is outdated for example, but it only just released earnings.; yeah only vibes matter these days; The growth story of these eight stocks falls into four groups:

* **Insane growth**: This is NVDA with triple digit growth in revenue and operating income, even if it's starting to diminish. If you believe if we're in the earning innings of AI and that this will be profitable (*even above the already ridiculously high valuations*), which I do, then continue to hold your positions.
* **Very strong growth**:
  * GOOG, MSFT, and META: Balance sheets speak for themselves
  * AMZN: The balance sheet here reflects that AMZN has a huge retail component that operates on low margins but a growing high-margin tech component compared to GOOG, META, and MSFT. This is shown by the much higher revenue with low YoY % change, but the lower operating income with the high YoY % change.
  * AVGO: I would classify this as strong growth based on the growth in revenue despite the decreased operating income, because this is accounted for by the operating expenses. I'm pretty sure this is all attributable to their acquisition costs from VMWare (which is also why their trailing PE is in the 100s).
* **Minimal growth**: AAPL is a very mature company with a robust revenue stream but basically no revenue or income growth for 3 years. I view it more of a ""value"" stock despite a P/E in the 30s (in fact, so does Avantis). I'm enthusiastically buying new Apple devices for this current upgrade cycle, but I suspect I'm in the minority among consumers.
* **Flat to negative growth**: TSLA has had flat revenues but negative income growth for the past several years as margins have shrunk, partly due to decreased EV demand and increased competition both domestically and abroad. This trend may have begun to slightly reverse itself on a quarterly basis, largely driven by energy credits, although not nearly back to its 2022 heights. To really have any meaningful growth (let alone spectacular growth implied by these valuations), TSLA bulls would have to hope for one of three things:  (1) actual meaningful progress on robotaxi after 10 years, (2) significantly increased EV sales, or (3) Elon Musk's political connections positively impacting the balance sheet by diverting revenue and income into company shareholders.; I will be messaging you in 6 months on [**2025-06-14 17:55:23 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2025-06-14%2017:55:23%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hdxxw6/broadcom_avgo_broke_the_1t_barrier_heres_how_it/m21nvbn/?context=3)

|-|-|-|-|; Not confusing it at all. I think broadcom is a ticking time bomb for customers to bail on them.

For the people I work with, as soon as they hear that broadcom buys a product they use they immediately start finding replacements.

My company started replacing VMware the day after broadcom bought them. 

They are horrible at managing products and product lines and that is not a company I'd ever invest in.; Until they have a falling out; Meh, you overestimate the impact Twitter has. Not so many people use it.; You think that was musk? he's the puppet, not the puppeteer, lol; Still wasn’t super cheap. He could’ve gotten Twitter for cheaper according to Dorsey. 

Elon gained $150b from Trump win but that could easily flip if Congress cuts EV and Battery tax credits. That would kill Tesla; Oh, Danny Boy

Danny Boy; > If Trump raises China tariffs, China says hippityhoppity Tesla Shanghai is now my property

I mean, very few people trust the Chinese government to respect private ownership rights, so they might as well just shred whatever reputation they have left.; Polestar and Volvo are Chinese owned, Swedish originally, but geely bought it during the financial recession.

Polestar makes one car here and Volvo makes others, but they’re looking at bringing more models in.; All that is irrelevant if Chinese companies dominate the rest of the world. The American market may be large, but a fraction of the entire world. And EVs are not even particularly popular in the US, compared to places like Norway.; > What US president is going to remove the tariffs on Chinese EVS and when is china going to make USA-compliant cars?

A U.S. President would have to be a complete moron to gut our automotive industry (which represents a national security interest) by allowing illegally subsidized, quasi-governmental Chinese car companies to predatory-dump vehicles into our market.

Maybe Trump will remove the tariffs.; Go look at their sales. They pretty much haven't had an original idea in a while except some insignificant update. They are black berry before apple knocked their teeth out.; Google and Amazon know so much about us that it's frightening.

Facebook is, too, but everybody should have seen that coming.; I'd be thrilled but I think it shoots past $200. The sentiment has completely shifted; I could comment but:

https://www.wsj.com/tech/googling-is-for-old-people-thats-a-problem-for-google-5188a6ed; Great, you should be all set to load up on Goog then and prove me wrong. Best of luck,; Broadcom is trading on the TAM growth potential for ASICs. There are only two players: Broadcom and Marvell; no, keep going. Dont stop cooking now; What’s hilarious is that global auto demand is relatively flat. The USA sells and produces fewer vehicles than it did in 2000. Same for 2015.; Time to short TSLA; Most big VMW customers have a big problem on their hands. Very big investments needed to get off VMW platform - which are not in their operational plans. If you make these, you take away from something else more strategic. 

I feel, many big customers will whine and then get in line.; How so; That kills everyone but Tesla.

Tesla has positive returns without rebates. It would hurt but it would not threaten its existence. Meanwhile, The other American EV makers go from bad to BK.; Chinese-owned but not Chinese market. Tesla won't have problems competing in the Western market. It's the inexpensive China standard evs are the threat. We are never opening the market to those.; Can’t read the article (paywall) but based on metrics that are available, looks like an opinion piece as the vast majority still use Google. 
Certainly not only old people. I mean you could ask people yourself and verify that’s not the case so if the author is making that point, that’s a bad hill to die on.; The [author of that article](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DLPHWe9UMAAtnUX.jpg) looks exactly like what I expected him to be ... a San Francisco tech-hipster.; What are your short positions on GOOG?; I think its completely detached from reality. It seems like the only key advantage to ASICs is for the person who ONLY wants to mine one thing ever, and the fact that said person doesn't have to compete with the rest of the world for the normal GPUs. Or perhaps its pure speculation that a lot of the cons to ASICs will go away in the future.

Completely unpopular opinion, and in the short term  AVGO may make some good money for share holders, but long term, I feel better with NVDA based on financials, and those same financials show AMD is undervalued. Eventually fundamentals come back to reality.; Surely the sensible play is TSMC?; Nvidia also is an ASIC player. 

They just have GPUs which do the job better; Manufacturers saw what people paid during Covid and raised the price, a lot of people are priced out.; Thanks for the premium.; Oh, so you think bes manipulating saudi and putin etcetcetc, not the other way around? Thats laughable; This is false. 

“Everyone else” among Big Auto makes ~3% of the EVs in the USA. They lose on each EV produced. They make all their profit on non-EVs. Why would not producing another EV be bad for them? 

Tesla makes 100% of its money from EVs. Losing $7.5k of incentive per vehicle will hurt them 95% of the time.; Ok? They’re based in Silicon Valley and it’s still the world’s tech hub.; Asic does compete with GPU in AI sector and that's why amd and nvda went down post AVGO earning l. Asic is much cheaper both in price and A LOT cheaper in power consumption.; Yes TSMC is a big winner and is a stock you hold forever. However it will always trade at a lower PE because of geopolitical risk.; When has he interacted with them; I must have outdated information because the article I read said ASIC was higher. At any rate, the dip for nvda, and amd should only be temporary. NVDA is sold out and still ramping up. Curious yo see how the fundamentals change for AVGO because at the moment, they're absolutely garbage.; ASICs cannot compete with Nvidia because the Nvidia ecosystem is CUDA. AMD technically also competes in the CUDA ecosystem. The ASICs like TPUs and Microsoft’s MAIA don’t. 

If you care about future Nvidia growth, you care about the CUDA market.; Pretty widely reported he has frequent calls with Putin. He didn't deny it either. The Saudis were big investors in Tesla at first and they own a stake in Twitter. He was also hanging with them and Murdoch in Qatar at the FIFA cup. He's pretty involved with quite a few dictators and terrible people.

Edit: Not saying I agree with the guy just that he isn't wrong on that specific point.; Yes; Damn bruh mad emotional while ain't knowing nuttin; Triton, openXLA, already tons of alternatives. Cuda is a pile of shits , it’s only advantages by now is that it’s the early player, but technical wise, the code is just shit; Bot tier comment; Tell that to literally every AI engineer outside Google; I’m a ML engineer in Meta. I can confirm and many of my colleagues can confirm. And I have a friend working in distributed system in nvidia. We all agree that cuda isn’t good. Its monopoly status doesn’t imply it’s good. Others are catching up. Yea, it’s true that we still use it as first choice. But It just matter of time. Even PyTorch is going through a re-wire right now to become more agnostic to the compiler."
AAPL taking a breather,"# 📊 AAPL Technical Breakdown and Small Account Challenge

I’ve been analyzing **Apple's (AAPL)** charts, and here’s what I’m seeing:

1. **Technical Indicators:**
   * Upward trend **broke below and retested** before showing signs of heading lower.
   * **Bearish death candle** on the daily chart.
   * A **Head and Shoulders** pattern on the 1-hour chart.
2. **Indicators:**
   * **RSI** is signaling **overbought** conditions.
3. **Fundamentals:**
   * The **PE ratio** is significantly **above its 10-year average**.

It needs a breather after the recent rocket run it's had from $219 to $250 in 25 days. That's a **12% increase** in **market cap in 25 days?!** How does that make sense?

Given this, I’m predicting a pullback to **$244** before a bounce or further direction. Current price: **$248**.

# 📝 How I’m Trading This:

I’m in a **spread trade** to maximize safety and minimize cost:

* **Sell $245 strike** and **buy $247.50 strike** as insurance.

This spread costs **$86** in risk for a potential **$164 profit** if AAPL dips below $245 by expiration. With these indicators lining up, it’s a **solid risk/reward** play.  
  
I’m documenting this in my **Small Account Challenge**: taking my account from **$500 to $1,000,000**. 📈

I’m right there with you this is my option only account so it’s been good year. I was up a lot more and VKTX got me for 20k because I was up a lot I figured I’d double down.

$YY - The Chinese Social Media App That’s Already Banned,"TLDR: The Bigo Live app has been taken down by Apple and Google for **allowing sales of child porn.** The Bigo Live app is about 80% of $YY’s revenue - and this hasn’t been reported widely - the stock has barely moved

**Overview**

On December 5th, Bigo Live was removed from both the iOS and Android app stores [following reports in the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/07/us/child-abuse-apple-google-apps.html?unlocked_article_code=1.hE4.IjV3.IUb4nn1olfoc&smid=url-share.) of the app allowing users to pay to watch livestreams of child sexual abuse. The app is still gone (search in your app store)

Joyy ($YY) is a Chinese social media company that gets most of its revenue from the Bigo Live app.

This doesn't seem to be covered anywhere related to $YY - for example [on Marketwatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/yy). Presumably because this is a small-cap Chinese stock no one cares about. The stock is down about 3.5% since the news was reported.

**$YY Revenue Breakdown**

Looking at their [Q3 Earnings](https://ir.joyy.com/news-releases/news-release-details/joyy-reports-third-quarter-2024-unaudited-financial-results) \- **BIGO apps are about 90% of their profit and revenue.**

https://preview.redd.it/brtjouauun6e1.png?width=2470&format=png&auto=webp&s=acbab4e2f3d59058a5122617570cd816c282991e

Two other apps, IMO and Likee are under BIGO here - but are about 10% of the total revenue

https://preview.redd.it/nqwbr0ftun6e1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5d7825599fc604c48519989febd05ba84e07877

So Bigo Live alone should be around 80% of $YY’s revenue and profit.

It’s worth noting that average revenue per paying user over the quarter was **$231** \- their content clearly monetized well.

They do have a website - [bigo.tv](http://bigo.tv) \- but I suspect it’s a small portion of their revenue. They don’t break out the data in their last [annual report](https://ir.joyy.com/static-files/de629d35-c15e-4046-82d7-856fddbd1d41) but they do say

>We primarily rely on thirdparty application distribution channels, such as the iOS App Store and the Google Play Store, to allow users to download and access our applications and games.

[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse); have to get this news picked up more over the weekend it seems; # **TLDR**

---

**Ticker:** YY

**Direction:** Down

**Prognosis:** Short

**Reason:** Bigo Live, which accounts for ~90% of YY's revenue, was removed from app stores for facilitating child sexual abuse.  Stock price barely reacted, presenting a short opportunity.  Author is already short 1000 shares.

**Additional Note:**  The author believes the company's actions are morally reprehensible and the stock should be worthless.; Just loaded on $35p 12/20; Now how do we get news papers to report on this to help it get to its lower deserved price point…..; Super weird it hasn't reacted. P72 is largest holder in 13Fs. They've been selling down the position (as of 9/30, so maybe they're out). But if some pod shops are involved they're definitely getting very frequent updates on app usage and downloads. This would have been flagged by now. 

They only owned like $80mm in shares, however. So could be only a few small positions across groups that have already been dumped. Not something they can trade in size. Still interesting though.

Edit: Great flag and DD OP. Checked Sensortower data. It's definitely inactive everywhere.; bought some 01/17 puts too; shorting low float Chinese stocks is recipe for disaster. at least use options; Cases like this show why shorting isn't always bad; My sister works in the financial media. She is going to reach out to her connects at Bloomberg; Deplorable.; Bought puts, fuck em!; The company's name is literally Joyy... ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260); Fascinating wonder how the broader market did not pick up on this, anyway I'm short 100 shares.; Option chain today is alllll puts at the ask; Jesus christ that's awful.; Already down 2% after hours; Thanks for the dd. Bought puts.; fuck that company, why aren’t the execs in prison?; I’m in on Monday.; Down almost 10% today. Good find op; its back on the playstore\*; Goodness gracious. This is horrible and so sad. How does this company continue to operate and trade on the public markets? 

I bought puts. 

Thanks for sharing this. First, we hope this company goes down. Second, we will make money when it does.; im in. f this company.; Why not puts OP?; I’m in too 25p 1/17; **12-11-2024(mm/dd/year) UGPIX dumped 20.51% of ownership**  
**11-29-2024 Tiff Investment opened short positions. ironically dec 2 2024** there was a **minishort squeeze** that happened with a **600k+ volume, today(12-13-2024)** has the same **volume but in a sell majorit**y. looking at the daily chart seems to be forming a bull flag but if in the next coming days this comes to break that then a flush to **35.22** is imminent considering theres also a gap left open there.; It seems shit is finally started hitting the fan.

[https://x.com/WolfpackReports/status/1869390477918863848](https://x.com/WolfpackReports/status/1869390477918863848); Up 1000% today; The stock is up 10.54% today. Such is humanity I guess.; holy shit I read the article and they only took down this app. The other FOUR apps they mentioned are all still up. No surprise the FBl doesn't care when American corporations get to profit off this; Great find OP

I'm gonna play Devil's Advocate here because we need to look at this trade objectively

The app getting banned from play store and app store makes getting new users difficult but existing users can still use the app. Their competitors have been banned too. So, these new users aren't completely lost to them. They can still be captured if the app gets re-instated.

I doubt these bans are permanent. They'll probably come with new moderation policies and procedures in a few weeks and claim they've addressed the issue. Unless there's political pressure on Apple and Google, I dont see why the app won't get reinstated once they clean up.; Im too dumb for options and only approved for covered. Guess i cant participate in the put party; https://preview.redd.it/ch13zd0wfo6e1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1f7d6e454ddfcc23864ba67e94558936ec0eb459

I have no idea what I'm doing. Can I go negative with this? Or is what I put in the max I can lose?; !remindme 2d; Kinda odd how the stock hasn't been affected by such a horrible news; [https://x.com/search?q=%24YY&src=cashtag\_click&f=live](https://x.com/search?q=%24YY&src=cashtag_click&f=live)

I'm still holding my puts; Ayyy, let's go boys. Good shit OP. Let this m'fer burn.; Apparently not the first time it has happened. You can find cases of it before and it being removed. Hopefully it does momentarily drop for the puts to print but based on what's happened before they will probably be back; This also just plays into the ""China bad"" narrative, which is nice.; And my axe! 75 x Feb21 30P; !remindme 2d; Just bought 40 DEC / Jan puts. Hope this gets picked up in time. Anyone have connects to the media?; Oh well. Here's to hoping something shitty happens to them by May.; I had to sell today, sadly. Anyway, I secured a 25% profit somehow. Thank you, OP!; I think there is still a possibility that Apple rejects to restore Bigo Live. That would be quite a big blow. Especially when prices are back to $40-ish it couldn't go higher than that basically, so there's no downside to short the stock.; This honestly should be pinned on the front page of WSB. Insane that this stock isn't in the ground.; [deleted]; They can be strangely resilient these companies. This is not enough to bring them down. They will just offer the app APK download via their website. Active users who crave their content will just update using APK.; Price action is anemic. Without media coverage it won’t budge; Funnily, it seems it was me whose complaint got Big Live removed from Microsoft Store. They send me an email about that. I'll that with Google tomorrow just for fun. The thesis stands -- they are still not restored in Apple Store.; Solid DD op. In with $30 puts 5/16; good DD op. I agree with you here. I entered a position on Friday and just exit’d at $39.00. 

I did more research over the weekend and this has happened multiple times in the past. I am afraid this won’t impact them much long term, perhaps a re-listing within 2-3 weeks is already weighed into the market price.; Huh apparently this does not affect the existing users, the app is only taken down to prevent new users from signing up. Could affect earning and guidance but a big drop is unlikely.; Wait but this news is super old??? It was removed 3 or 4 years ago.; Party pooper

There are 60 million shares overall. As of 30 sept 2024 they announced $3,302.1 million in cash, or $55/share in cash.

As long as they break even... the shares are undervalued.; Someone just needs to mail this to a Trump staffer and it’ll blow up on Fox; Good bot; Copied that; Did the same. Puts...70; I bought 6x $35p 12/20 as well, it’s strange that even though the stock is down to 38.xx the puts haven’t been gaining and are stuck at .28 ; Same; why so soon?; Can you share more?; Nice! I hope the pick it up quickly.; Thanks! Doing God's work; Any updates on this? should be pretty huge news imo; Chinese company with ""HQ in Singapore"" but really its still in China; And back again to $38. A very resilient stock.; Yes it's back but video reels no longer work ; The spreads are pretty awful ngl ; Spreads aren't great for puts, also wasn't sure how long this would take to spread.; Squeeze deez nuts you fuckin nerd.

|-|-|-|-|; Because there aren't news about that on investing-related sites. At least we can see lower lows and lower highs almost every day. That's a bit reassuring.

It reminds me of Roblox. Hindenburg Research dropped a hit piece about them. The price? It's up 25% since then.; Damn bro… they got relisted on play store; Baidu paid them $1.9 billion for the YY.com (chinese social media) acquisition that baidu has since pulled out of - they'll have to pay that back - you can see it under liabilities on their balance sheet. See their financials https://ir.joyy.com/news-releases/news-release-details/joyy-reports-third-quarter-2024-unaudited-financial-results; Came here to say this; That's definitely possible - but 65% of their app revenue is from iOS which mostly doesn't allow third party downloads.

https://app.sensortower.com/android/publisher/publisher/Bigo%2BTechnology%2BPte.%2BLtd. ($5 million in revenue last month); I was also thinking this.  I want to get puts and ride this fucker to zero.  But if there's a website and an apk I don't know if revenue will take a significant hit, growth and public perspective yes but the money will still roll in.; Agree here - know anyone who might be interested in covering it?; Yes, ntm with their share buybacks they can keep this up forever; I believe existing users transactions won't work. Not sure if this is true for ios but it is true for android. Would be curious if you knew; No? Read the article it was removed like a week ago now; Baidu paid them $1.9 billion for the YY.com (chinese social media) acquisition that baidu has since pulled out of - they'll have to pay that back - you can see it under liabilities on their balance sheet.

I picked up May 17 '25 $30 puts for $1.40.; Yeah i was looking at the spreads had a bit of hope they were mispriced like achr. But them puts are pricy.; pun intended?; There's a need for us to start talking about it. Any company profiting off the sexual exploitation of kids should not even exist in the first place!; You are forgetting about Likee. Bigo is not their only app. They earn much advert revenue from Likee. And it is still growing. They are not going under with loss of Bigo. What they will likely do is to get themselves reinstated or create another similar app.; I reposted an abridged version on twitrer, stockwits and after hours app (social network for traders). Am going to try to mention YY on SeekingAlpha.

Will try to reach out to project Hindenburg and such, maybe they get interested.

I wonder if Joyy violates some Nasdaq listing requirements by… you know… enabling CP distribution. A super long shot, but hey it won’t hurt to lodge a complaint to Nasdaq or even SEC.

If I fail to make it news, then my puts are fucked; Perhaps you could post your dd to other subs; I reposted an abridged version of your post on twitter, stockwits and after hours app (social network for traders). Am going to try to mention YY on other investor resources.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*; I did the same. No guarantee we'll find a good fill on the way out though. it's a super illiquid chain. Realizing ITM would have been the way to go. If it doesn't move it would at least ensure you can recover on the intrinsic value.; We can actually break this revenue down 

From their Q3 earnings

https://ir.joyy.com/news-releases/news-release-details/joyy-reports-third-quarter-2024-unaudited-financial-results

Total revenue for their BIGO segment (Bigo, Likee, and IMO) was 496 million. 

Of that, 418 million was ""livestreaming."" 

So 85% of BIGO segement revenue last quarter was livestreaming - short form video is a very small part of their business.; Reddit (the company, not r/WallStreetBets, the subreddit) has banned Seeking Alpha articles everywhere on Reddit.

To get around this, please repost your comment/thread with the link removed, and the relevant parts of the article copy and pasted. 

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*; Gj seems like you did something, or the timing aligned xD; UPD:  
I sent emails to Hindenburg Research, Culper Research. Ofc, it would take a time even they GET interested, but still. Also lodged a complaint to fucking NASDAQ urging them to investigate $YY if it's in compliance with the listing requirements. Lol. Probably it's all in vain, but at least I did something.

Any ideas are appreciated; Same here. Someone - this is your time to be a hero! Spread this far and wide. 

OP walked so you can run.; And if it does play before earnings, then I will exit prior to earnings because the speculation and uncertainty will likely have already done enough damage to be profitable. IV leading into earnings will increase if this hits before then.; True, but I think the premium is decent given if it doesn't hit the news cycle until after earnings. An investigation report or other news cycle prior to then will offer a haircut, but this has to impact earnings I would think. I don't know, I just think the put protection is more time in case this takes a while to play out.; Lol; Email the compliance departments and boards of owners like FMR.; Need to see more people talking about this than us! Quiet weekend on the update front. No pickup.; When is the next earnings? ; It definitely will impact earnings. Just looked through the most recent [presentation](https://ir.joyy.com/static-files/f4a7ccbb-07e6-412b-952b-1ace063940dd).

Live streaming is indeed 80% of revenues (which MAU and spend are already trending downward).

I'm plugged in with a few small cap L/S funds. I'll be floating this around in January if price doesn't seem to be reacting. Might help get the narrative out there.; An interesting idea! However, I cannot seem to find their compliance email address. I found a post on Reddit with the same request basically. As was suggested in that post, I sent to r/fidelityinvestments's mods lol.

I'm thinking Martin Shkreli might be interested in this opportunity.; Mar. 24, '25.; You're the GOAT. There is a seeking alpha piece touting growth posted on the 10th I was thinking about commenting on. I'm just a simpleton though. Haha.; There's growth in the short-form video segment. But the core business is in decline and new platform aims to compete with TikTok... Good luck. It's a dumpster fire with a pile of cash to burn at this point.; The stock is still trading below its cash value though. Even in the event that the news cycle blows up, how much can we realistically expect this to decrease in a short time frame? (Say for an options play); Tough to say really. Baidu also broke off the acquisition of their Chinese TikTok clone they bought in 2021, that's a huge piece of the cash balance. Short report that came out today mentions this. They say they might need to return $1.4B, but I read through the merger docs last week and wasn't able to find what the break up fee would be.

I wouldn't be optimistic of $YY getting the upper hand in a legal battle. But I also don't know anything about M&A law in China.



But even if it's $2B pile of cash. I highly doubt they maintain profitability following this. Advertisers won't want to work with them going forward if the app is re-instated. Their SG&A expenses are ~$200M/quarter, so they won't be around long. Key risk to short thesis would be they get the short-form video app back and it's actually highly profitable. I have my doubts here though about long-term viability of it, however."
"TSMC 2024 results solid, 2nm tech progressing well, AI business outlook closed","In November 2024, TSMC sales reached $8.834 billion, up 34 per cent year-on-year

This year-on-year decline has sparked market concerns about data centre build-outs, although overall demand for AI chips remains strong

The cumulative total for January to November 2024 was $83.717 billion, up 31.8 per cent year-on-year

With Bloomberg analyst Charles Shum noting that TSMC dominance in pricing power has further solidified its market

Although November sales were slightly below my forecast (up 36.3% y/y)

TSMC technological progress on the 2nm process has been impressive. The company has been working on the 2nm process at its Hsinchu Baoshan plant and expects to reach a monthly capacity of 20,000 wafers completed by the end of 2025 for the N2 process. Although the current yield of 2nm chips is 60%, which is lower than the 70% standard required for large-scale mass production, TSMC plans to formally enter the mass production stage in 2025, which is expected to be the future of high-end chips

With the recent surge in Apple's stock price, Apple is one of TSMC important customers, a media revealed that Apple products with 2nm chips 2026 iPhone 19 series is expected to be equipped with 2nm memory

Apple's iPhone 17 series will continue to use TSMC 3nm process based A19/Pro processor

However, TSMC future remains full of potential thanks to its leading position in 2nm process technology and its close cooperation with large customers such as Apple. The continued growth of its AI business and the mass production of high-end chips are expected to bring strong revenue growth to the company, and the stock is expected to have significant upside in the future.

Compared to Samsung, TSMC is leading the way in terms of 2nm process yields and technological advances. Samsung's 2nm chips currently have yields of around 10-20 per cent, while TSMC is expected to start mass production of its 2nm chips in 2025 and become a key technology supplier for Apple products. This has led TSMC to receive increasing attention in the global semiconductor market

As a long-term investor, TSMC AI business revenue is expected to grow by 30-40 per cent in 2025. As demand for AI chips expands, TSMC will continue to benefit from technological advances and growing market demand. I personally expect TSMC shares to reach $240 by March 2025, mainly due to its strong market position and future growth potential",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hditzk/tsmc_2024_results_solid_2nm_tech_progressing_well/,33,2024-12-13 19:31:03,"

[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse); If Intel had a hope of catching up to TSMC with 18A, they just killed it by firing Gelsinger and promoting board members that want to scrap the new fabs. TSMC stands alone atop the semi manufacturing mountain.

We're talking about a company where fat-margin monopolists like Apple, NVidia, Google, and Qualcomm are going to have to stand in line and try to outbid each other for wafers. It's an uber-bullish situation for $TSM.

I'm a doombear who thinks that stocks are grossly overvalued, bonds are grossly overvalued, real estate is grossly overvalued, crypto is worthless, continued economic growth is impossible, every G7 government will financially collapse by 2050, and capitalism as we know it will soon end. But god damn it, TSMC is my conviction play.; I am confident that TSMC will reach new heights; [removed]; And then, enter Trump, the guy who says we need to scrap the CHIPS act and just put tariffs on the companies making chips to get them to build here, and even singling out Taiwan by name, and then you have a pretty convincing argument that the top is in.; Written by bad AI.

Also it’s a safer play for anyone who’s afraid of invasion from china. This year was a bit disappointing, but has to do with everything non-ai, which will start going up again in 2025 and 2026.; I agree with you that if tsmc wants to climb higher then he has to work with the right people; Why would Trump increase Taiwan tariffs? ; Why does Trump do anything? 


He's been ranting for years about how Taiwan ""stole"" chip manufacturing from the US, and how they don't pay the US for military protection from China.  "

I am triggered.; This just shows that everything is massively overbought, for something to rise other has to fall.

Long the stock, short the management.; The market is cleaning out all the naive 0DTE NVDA option gamblers. You should feel good about being long on NVDA - the market will eventually reward you as long as you don't sell early.

All the whining now about NVDA is primarily from those that gambled their dead grand-mother's money on short term options.  The big funds are all taking advantage of that pain by loading up on cheap, salty tear-soaked shares.; Well you are buying Nvidia at the top, what do you expect?; Sounds like someone is late to the NVDA party.

The Apple-AVGO deal, which was announced a day prior to AVGO’s earnings, clearly signaled increased competition for NVIDIA. This was a foreseeable development, and the outcome reflects insufficient research on your part.

It's wild that NVDA earns in a quarter what AVGO earns in a year and NVDA is down but AVGO up 20%. 🙃; AMD hasn't held a green day for at least two months lol, there's no comparison; I used to think NVDA would be the first company to 4 trillion, but it seems like AAPL is right there almost. So AAPL probably has that.

I still think NVDA will be the first to 5 trillion; Yeah, it’s rough man. It’s a blip and I wouldn’t have sold it, but I get it. We can now see gain porn here for all the degens who gambled on an ER play; NVDA is worth more than 3x what AVGO is. NVDA is going down because investors see higher growth stocks to invest in because how much can NVDA grow when it's almost the most valuable company in the world already.; You really just gotta throw up your hands sometimes 😂 I mean besides Nancy pelosi idk many who expected moves like this from AVGO right now; Were all regarded; One is a rollercoaster, the other a slide?; Just tell me it’ll hit 146 again 😢; Stock just formed a head & shoulders pattern on the 5d chart… so I think 146 not going to happen any time soon"
"r/Stocks Daily Discussion & Fundamentals Friday Dec 13, 2024","This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on fundamentals, but if fundamentals aren't your thing then just ignore the theme.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

The Board has the authority under the agreement with the subscribers (policyholders) at Erie Insurance Exchange to set the management fee rate at its discretion; however, the maximum fee rate permissible by the agreement is 25 percent.

Today, even though I think iron ore has weaker fundamentals than met coal, I think VALE is potentially a better deal than my coal companies.... 

Iron ore spot price is not great but it's a lot higher than in the mid 2010s when it was crashing and burning (e.g. $40 per ton vs today's $100). VALE has a marginal cost in the low $20s per ton. There are many producers that quickly get priced out / bankrupted if iron ore keeps falling.

They are at 3.8x forward EV/EBITDA, lower than their peers. They did somewhere around $7-8B in FCF last 12 months. 10.8% dividend yield.

"" For 2024 and 2025, Fitch expects net leverage of around 0.6 and 0.8, respectively."" They are sitting on $4.6B in cash + very FCF positive currently, so they can easily cover the years of payouts/reparations from past disasters.

It's gotten so cheap mostly because of Brazil in general selling off. If sentiment reverses, I think you could see some beautiful multiple expansion. Otherwise, you can rely on big dividend payouts to keep you afloat along the way.

Thus, Elon has only 423.6/3184.8 = 13.3% equity in Tesla, which at it's current $1.34T market cap, means his position is valued around $178B.

He certainly has some equity in other notable companies, particularly SpaceX, but he doesn't like have more than $25B. Therefore, his net worth is more like $200B.

But I thought maybe it would be useful to compare this take to my position on global diversification as a Canadian. Most of my global diversity is from the XEF etf, which ""tracks a market-cap-weighted index of developed-market stocks in Europe, Australasia, and Far East, and excludes the US and Canada."" 

I invest separately in Canada and America, and include a ~20% share in this non-NA. It's YTD is 15% (and only 6.36% over 3 years), which seems noticeably better than this Non-US equities chart. Even though it has not performed anywhere near US, it still seems a lot better than what this chart is showing. 

So is the poor performance of this above Non-US ETF about including Canada? Or is it that my fund is only ""Developed"" markets and not all-global? (I also have a separate smaller ~6% share in ""Emerging"" markets, and ~1.25% ""Frontier"" markets.)

Ultimately, I think there might be value in blaming particular sections of ""Global"" ETFs rather than as a whole.

* Developed (XEF) - 14.35% YTD
* Emerging (ZEM) - 18.03% YTD
* Frontier (FM) - 9.34% YTD; Honestly, out of a select few individual picks it's nigh-impossible to invest outside the U.S.; Why would you bother?? Honestly.

China hates their own stock market.

Europeans hate their own economy with passion. 

Only game in the town right now is US, frankly ... there's nothing else.; Lots of single stocks are performing well (games workshop, swissquote, siemens energy, ...) though the ex-US basket is doing terribly atm.; There's definitely some good names out there, but broad markets are in the dumpster right now.; Yeah I feel the same way on a daily basis. Conventional wisdom says someday, things will revert to the mean, but man has it been awful run since 2008 for ex-US.; Tsmc and bti are my ex us. Both doing well over the past year; Why bother? Because diversification. Nobody should be buying global to beat the US market.; Her AVGO call options are enough to pay the bills.; Me no like this company. Gives me an eerie vibe.; I was really hoping for it to fall under $400 again so I could pick up more. I was too late for the flash dip on Tuesday; What an awful chart.  I like it!  These are the stocks that are going to kick ass in 2025 if they can deliver.  

In my watch list, thank you.  :); I'm heavy here. Dieing for a run back to 200; I really have no idea what it’s about but lots of people are talking if it’s risks. What are those risks what is the debt burden what other relevant info you got to share?; lol no it’s not. 

So many risks for QCOM; Go for it. I don't think there is anything wrong with speculation or going risk on, especially if you are basically using house money. 

Plus it seems like you have success with beaten down names and just waiting.; How is inflation bearish on gold? I thought people would buy it as a hedge against inflation.; Movement down or up ?; weird as this sounds, I actually like it. I am not a crypto bull (though I've \*always\* liked it's potential), and I tend to see it happening in cycles

if it truly is just a flash in the pan, then the NASDAQ will benefit from it, then discard after a year or two

I like the idea of having a small stake in a high risk asset decoupled from the S&P (even if it sometimes seems to track it)

edit: I only keep NASDAQ in my Roth atm; I'm sure everything will be fine if there's a downturn given that amount of bull leverage in the market.; SE  or  NVCR  I bought more of both today; If I had dry powder, I'd be buying more AMD; AVGO, PLTR; Wanted to short that one since a while.. my broker doesn't allow it 😱  guess, I should thank him?; Especially when their main selling point is lower prices when they usually aren’t the cheapest. And you have to buy so much. 

More and more people are single. The Costco model of forcing people to buy so much and waste most of it is outdated. And bad for the environment. ; They'll probably due well in early part of next year with all the tax loss harvesting at the end of this year.; Likewise. But for years for me.  I finally cut bait when they announced spinning off the biz they acquired 3 years ago and crowed about all the efficiencies….  Thanks for the tax help, fellas; a brutal sell off; I’d say so. Any winning trades above 20% I tend to sell off, reevaluate and look at new trades. Typically take the profit and put into VOO or SCHD, go back to the research.; You do you man, but personally I don't think it makes sense for people just to follow Buffet all the time. Birk has like 1T worth of assets. 

Even Buffet himself talks about Cash not being great. 

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-once-called-investment-124400339.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-once-called-investment-124400339.html)

>In a 2008 op-ed for The New York Times, Buffett warned, “Today people who hold cash equivalents feel comfortable. They shouldn’t. They have opted for a terrible long-term asset, one that pays virtually nothing and is certain to depreciate in value.”

...

>“I don't think anybody sitting at this table has any idea of how to use it effectively, and therefore we don't use it,” he stated, emphasizing that “we only swing at pitches we like.”

>Buffett has also voiced concerns about future complexities, noting, “As the world gets more sophisticated, complicated and intertwined, more can go wrong.” He added that the company aims to be prepared to “act when that happens.”

More than likely we will probably see a correction at some point.; Buffett is only at what...30% cash?

You're currently doing a leveraged Buffett play lol....; You must be either 80 year old or Swiss.; To be clear, Buffett - and BRK - did not “cash out.”   They trimmed some of their largest holdings.  The bots love a good headline like “Buffett sells AAPL at the top” but dig deeper - they still own 5% of the company.  And still own millions of shares in dozens of other public companies; Is Buffet even still trustable? He’s 94. The only other people his age that are still working are politicians and they’re all a senile joke so why are we still listening to Warren?; Uber losing market share to waymo

https://x.com/aleximm/status/1867257473671082356?t=OdywiSdl9Ik95NKxro47zg&s=19; These things are more like a media stunt. Govs pretending to regulate.; they made it to 1 trillion. Pretty big day for AVGO. How many total companies are in the 1 trillion club?

AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOG, AMZN, META...

is TSM at a trillion now? I suppose crazy ass TSLA is 1 trillion, that's nuts, lol; Buy the dip; AVGO up, rest down; No meaningful revenue growth from AI investment by any company.; Rotation.. i.e. finally, people are starting to look at PE; It's kind of a few things from what I gather. Semi's are really broad, so if you are asking about the whole sector, a lot of has been in bear markets for a while now. 

Companies that deal with auto and industrial chips have seen a slowdown, probably due to a super cycle and order pull through during the pandemic. These markets where expected to rebound this year, but they still haven't. 

The only thing that has seen some solid growth is really just the AI chips, which a lot of those companies have already seen a ton of gains. 

Something like NVDA is up now 176% for the year. So there is probably also some profit taking right now. 

Then there is some fear still probably of the China exports, which a lot of companies due business in China.; Currency exchange risk. Any company doing more than 50% of its business outside the US is in the dog house and will be for a while longer. Everything about the coming administration will lead to an overly strong dollar.  (Worth looking for comments from Match CEO from this past week - they’re only about 40% non-US but were clear that the exchange is gonna kill em next quarter); Same, meli is doing nicely albeit a bit stagnant at current price. I just bought into STNe and sold some CSPs on it at $9 since it's around the 52 week low. Business seems to be executing fine and mostly the risk in Brazil seems to be the big concern from what I can find. Iirc they had a bad EPS at one point but it's back up and they even did some buybacks.; Volume is extremely low.; MACD just hit a bullish cross over and the flow is mostly all positive. Call support at $170-$171, just broke out of the weekly..looks like it may just keep going. Now that I am saying all of this I may jump in for a swing trade. Risk/reward seems decent; Higher; Avgo and walmex keeping me green somehow; Doing ok with Teredyne.  Otherwise, yes, all took a big poo poo.; S&P down 0.12%?; I try to avoid my bear impulse because at best it's only right short term and at worst it pulls me off my positions and costs me money- but when semiconductors struggle, big tech and the S&P almost always follow suit on a delay. Semi equipment is the canary for chips generally and they've been pulling back pretty hard, so I'd expect the S&P and Nasdaq to get rangebound at least. We're seeing lots of companies pulling back on capex as well, including most of big tech. So my logical brain is saying ""bear time coming"" but the market is not logical over short timeframes, it's emotional.; You've consistently gotten several of your predictions wrong. Also, as Morgan Housel says, it's easier to be a pessimist than an optimist. It makes you sound smarter, while being optimistic makes one sound like a sales man; Hopefully the mom is an AMZN shareholder.; Wait, are you that guy with Dec $200 Calls?; Market cap too small; I’ve been a longterm bagholder with a similar thesis.  It’s been frustrating at times - the macro tailwinds are huge but they’re not a great executor and I question the mgmt at times.  But I’m still in there; Mind explaining that pls? Is it related to grip upgrades?; For all the want that solar be a thing, it has been heavily impacted by rates for a few years (and we're likely not going back to ultra low rates for a very long time) and even though commercial doesn't have quite the headwinds that residential does, it (see NXT) often seems to trade with it. 

You have something like ENPH lose 75% off the high in 2022, bounce moderately and then start eroding again - lost about 33% off the peak this year going into the election then proceeded to lose about another 33% in literally about a week over policy concerns before bouncing.

It will be a thing, but without the tailwind of low rates maybe not as much of a thing as people want and it's such a ""best of times"" followed by ""holy shit worst of times"" sector because of significant impact of rates and worries over policy among other things that it feels like there's easier growth themes.

I own a little bit of solar that I bought about a month ago trying to play a bounce and am already thinking about selling. I'd like to like solar more as a long-term investment than I do.; I do worry a little that this move is coming from 2027 guidance estimates, which to me feels quite heady... Then again, if Hock's numbers are right, and he wasn't even counting Apple and OpenAI ramps in the estimates; Nike is dying in the US and Europe. I would avoid, so much competition in today's world and not currently fashionable.; I do think it's concerning, but probably winds up being nothing (or something that we never hear the actual reasoning behind.) I've added some shorts in recent days but very minor and unrelated to the drone story. 

Did buy a very small position in ONDS as a lotto ticket play that might benefit.; They say theyre seeing them over US bases in Germany now too.

I have to say I think its us.; What is it then?; Costco should give you a discount if you buy shares in bulk; Will you be buying back in at some point?; Don’t feel bad I got in at $200. The worst performer in my portfolio; I wouldn't say a big mistake yet. It's only down $5 from that.; trash; Advanced Money Destroyers; Which ones you looking at?; It’s also heavily influenced by UNH, its largest holding.; I’m an idiot- what’s ym; Generally I don't like investing in middlemen that don't provide justifiable value to either side of a transaction (patients and health systems). Eventually that arrangement erodes. Either by alternatives gaining favor or the government regulating it.; I can’t divorce a healthcare investment from politics, they are too entwined; I bought UNH shares; NVDA isn't going down to 80; All my life up to that point.; That's nice, honey. 

Completely healthy for one human being to have a net worth of $178B.; Wow you know more than Bloomberg.; I thought he didn't end up getting margin called and still has the shares he used as leverage. Also Spacex has been doing private share offerings with a presumed marketcap of something like $350 billion which may be part of why they're saying he's at 400B along with TSLA holdings.; value investors have been just destroyed. value investing is dead. its been 16+ years where value investing has been dead.

I think a new paradigm is upon us.

investing now is about instituations making money as fast as possible from momentum trades vs actual fundementals; Amd has indeed been very disappointing.  How did they let avgo eat their lunch? Why can't amd work with Amazon to design chips?; SEC fraud charges..  all publicity is good publicity!; Guessing it is a combination of:

- Different weights into Canada, developed, emerging, frontier. (I am pretty sure MSCI All Country does not invest in frontier at all). VXUS, for example, is only 7.5% Canada, so if I'm 30% in VXUS (like the global stock market is), I'm only 2.3% allocated to Canada. 
- Currency effects with the Canadian dollar versus USD/Euro/Pound/Yen.
- Possibly different dividend treatment
- Weighting of small/mid caps within all of these regions

My international exposure is basically just VXUS + AVDV (ex-US developed small cap value).

Also, I think you realize this, but the above charts are about valuation, not the actual price performance. It is showing that the discount on the P/E multiple on ex-US stocks relative to US stocks is 2 standard deviations below its historical norm. This could therefore be caused both by earnings / price.; Tons for sure;  

Im watching it nothing more  There are early signs of bottoming and a possible upswing or continuation happening.; My biggest losses and wins definitely come from similiar setups. It has worked for me in the past, usually buying into massive fear sell offs is a decent idea unless the bad news just keeps rolling in...; The cutting cycle on interest rates will be shortened if inflation remains sticky. Gold tracks the depreciation of currency but tighter lending standards reinforce a bullish dollar.; Unknown, it's simply returned to where it was three days ago.; MACD shows it ended the session bearish; People did not learn anything from three years ago.; Against my better judgement I have bought more today. There were buy out rumors in March. It’s clear Callaway acquiring TopGolf was a mistake, but maybe splitting can benefit both. I’m probably making a mistake lol; Why thank you; I mean, when he published that article, the S&P had fallen 40%. CAPE stood at 15. Today, we are in a relentless bull market that has spanned a decade and a half. Valuations are basically the highest in history. In terms of valuation, the dot com bubble is the only possible comparison. Slightly different context, don’t you think?; I’m not going cash just because of WB - it’s due to FOMO that reminds me a lot of the peak in 2021. Cryptos like “FARTCOIN” are pumping (it’s an actual coin), meme stocks are pumping, any bearish opinion is frantically downvoted probably by people who just bought the top in some tech companies with absurd 70x p/s ratios, etc.

The fact I had to explain to several redditors on this sub that ETFs and individual stocks are not the same thing leads me to believe that “dumb money” has entered the market which is usually when larger, smarter money pulls the rug.; Uber's earnings per share and free cash flow are growing rapidly, very quickly. Will this pose a threat soon?; Yep, nice to have it no longer looming for sure though. Sentiment is already terrible; I did lol; I genuinely cant tell if you are referring to the AI semi names or the beaten up equipment, auto, power names.; Same thing must have happened to PAGS that stock is also down heavily this year. It getting to point I wonder if MELI/NU or someone else acquires them.; There are a lot of growth/spec stocks down 4-7% right now.; That capex has not led to any meaningful revenue growth, so it's understandable.; Lol she is ;); No I have 1/10/25 $185 calls. I'm safe for now but theta is going to start hitting and reducing any extrinsic value. I had a target of $200 to sell before Christmas.; Thanks.; Yeah I’ve looked at them in the past. Should probably look deeper into management and the financials; Not OP but my two cents as a shareholder:  not just total grid upgrades but also on a house-by-house level. I have a small home in Northern California where, when the wind blows, our utility shuts off power to literally thousands of homes. Incredibly frustrating and then I got a backup system with a small solar array AND gas-powered generator, anything and everything I need to ride out a 72-hour period.  I don’t have any medical needs where power is life-or-death but i wonder about those who do and how they make it - probly upgraded before me; For me it’s related to people needing power when natural disasters take down power for days on end; Enph has had that happen but they also had cratered revenues to go along with it. FSLR has lost 33% while continuing to grow and make profits. Also ENPH is still trading at a ridiculous multiple even after crashing. 

I’m not super convinced by the interest rate argument, every industry has to eat those rates. Also they’ve been up for a while now and the slowdown that you would expect to come with it has already happened. Definitely a longer term play with possible near term upside as well; They're us military drones being tested; Subscription business with 93% renewal rate and 94% employee retention.

The products at Costco are all cost-plus.; Does AMC still give out free popcorn?; Depends on the price point. If it retraces below the 200-day EMA all the way back to $10-15, then yes. It would be criminally undervalued considering the YoY improvements. The macro tailwinds that powered its initial rise haven't disappeared either.; STNE and DKNG are a couple. Want to see them go lower though. STNE would just be a 1% of portfolio YOLO to see what happens over the next 1-2 years.; Dow Jones futures.; Fair comment; You don't know how healthcare works.; RemindMe! 1 year; lmao; [removed]; not likely, they probably just want to maximize clicks; he sold a metric ton of shares in 2022 to fund the purchase of Twitter... just straight up sold hundred million+ shares on the open market; I don't think value investing is dead or ever will be, but I think the short term meme and hype rallies are something that isn't going away anytime soon. Most of these names are fairly small fish and rally hard and then fall hard. There will be times when these kind of stocks are dead again and times when they rally harder than they are now. I think a lot of people are reading too much into them. Better to just make a decision whether play that game or stay out of that side of the market, no need to have a tantrum over it.; Can you define what you mean by “value investing” and why you think its dead?; “New paradigm” okay, this is the top. Everytime that someone says it, be it 1999 or 2021 we crash hard; Thanks for the response. You make some good points. I just find it weird that everyone seems to be complaining so much about their VXUS, and while my global allocation is very much under-performing US, it's still performing better than expectations. But like you said, there are a lot of factors, and we're not comparing 1 to 1.; I just think that sometimes speculating gets a bad wrap. If you are young and you are being responsible with your money, like in this case playing with just money you made, I don't see anything wrong with. 

To add to it, everyone has different approaches and being constant with your approach I do think helps over time. I've come to learn that you won't always be right, but as long as your more right than wrong, your gains should outweigh those losses.; Maybe when I'm an old fogey I'll grow to hate downturns instead of seeing them as opportunities.; You may be right that someone may acquire one piece or the other where they’d never want the combined entity.; I saw someone (on the BBAI or Penny subs) ask what price to earnings meant. I know there are TSLA buyers that don't know the practical difference and meaning of what Ford earns per share and what TSLA makes per share and what that means relative to their current price.


I've seen people again start talking about BTC as a ""business"" entity. Doge popped again. I've seen multiple people that don't know the stock they are buying and pumping is actively selling shares openly. People are reposting fabricated ""leaked"" earnings to pump stocks. 


I've seen people honest to God pump with all sincerity absolute garbage companies and when you push them they will admit they are ""just looking for a short term pop"". It's all one big  rug pull. 


I'm mostly cash and scaling into an inverse ETF.; Makes total sense and I never try to critique people around what they want to do. To me, at the end of the day, it's your money. Make your own decisions. 

I just think sometimes people will just follow what Buffet does, but not listen to what Buffet says lol. 

Like buffet is a big time just buy a low cost index. Basically a VTI and chill bro. 

I personally don't do ""cash"" positions, but I have liquidity to move over to take advantage of any opportunities. I screen to find things to invest in and for the past like 3 months or longer, there really isn't anything even interesting to buy right now. 

The only moves I made was buying some semi equipment names because they have moved into great value territory for a long term position, but I'm buying knowing that the short to mid term is probably going to be really rocky.; Not soon but market sees it coming and that'll bottle up the share price if they think disruption is on the horizon.; Both. Within semi space, TSM, ASML are getting the attention, finally. Personally, I'm sick or hearing about NVDA all the time. ""Demand is insane"" but so are the valuations.; Would prob come at a nice premium since they're profitable and growing profits still, just slower growth. 

Anyway if you're interested in STNE I got like 3% for selling CSPs one week out and plan to wheel those or keep selling more until they executed. $9 stroke for 12/20, .30 to sit on the money a week; They will correct further.; NVDA and to a lesser extent AVGO and MRVL are the big winners of the AI gold rush-not software like big tech yet. We're at the point in the dotcom-like cycle where companies like Cisco were shooting up due to hardware sales but microsoft was still poking around looking for ways to grow revenue in software. I also think AMD will get in on things after people are through tax loss harvesting them.

I'm looking for acquisition targets rather than buying big tech here, as I think M&A will be hot the next 4 years. The FTC has caused a backlog in what bigtech has been wanting to snap up and when given the chance by the new admin's laissez faire approach they're going to consolidate for marketpower where they can.; Sell Sell.. ; Hopefully RCAT product!; Groceries as a service; Can I politely ask, what % of revenue is subscription?; It's an interesting take on it at least.; So subscriptions are worth a 60x multiple??

How’s that make sense; Seems like a pretty good recovery today since the morning? I'm still holding but might exit soon as well; Would you care to explain?; I will be messaging you in 1 year on [**2025-12-13 20:36:42 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2025-12-13%2020:36:42%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hd9ewq/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_dec/m1wykhw/?context=3)

Keep the political stuff off the sub; Love that last paragraph, very true for me over last 5 years. I have scores of losers, but mostly small and contained losses with say 15 really great winners I let run hard and long; Agreed. I like AMAT and KLAC but both have ugly charts but excellent long term setups.; I am in TSM and 4 of the fab 5. TSM has been good, the rest not so much. I am not trying to be edgy by leaving out the NVDA, MRVL, AVGO but just genuinely more interested in equipment makers.; They sell Gas and GaaS; Looks like 1.8% at a glance; I don’t think % of revenue is a very good lens to view that from since it’s probably 98c of profit for every dollar brought in; It has made sense for Netflix shareholders.  And Amazon Prime.  And 135x has made sense for Spotify shareholders.  

I’ll redirect you to my original point which is that actually knowing what a business is and does should be the first key to understanding it.; It's recovered back to the 100-day EMA. Probably should watch volume though: the deciding factor for me to exit my position is the rising selling pressure over the past week. For the last month volume has been slightly bearish, but it's turned up viciously in the last 3 sessions.; They're corporations like anything other. If you don't like that, fine, and i agree, but that's the system. That shouldn't guide investment decisions. I buy coca cola stock, but i tell people not to drink their products (I'm in healthcare). In fact i even tell people that their soda consumption is literally putting money into my checking account. Also, an insurance company denying claims can have beneficial effects too, like countering price gouging by pharmaceutical companies.  They don't deny claims for simple, cheap, lifesaving interventions like basic antibiotics, etc. Most denials are for complex or expensive procedures, tests, and drugs that really aren't necessary, but would be lucrative businesses if insurance were to cover them.; Idk what you said but I'm not easily offended, couldn't even read it lol; I wrote a like post, not a daily thing, on the sub about a year ago about the lessons I've learned over the years being a more active investor. 

That's a big one for me. Just realizing you won't always be right. Just need to be more right than wrong lol. 

>**Lesson 4: Be patient and you still can be wrong**

>If you done your due dillegence when investing, it at least gives you confidence around your investment. You can be right, but have the timing wrong. The market can also disagree with you at any point. At least being confident in your investments will help in any down turns. Especially if the company is growing revenues and expanding margins.

>Biggest thing is that even after all this, you can still get it wrong. The goal for me is have my winners outperform my losers. Realizing that you will still pick some losers is ok, but at least you have followed a process that should have an end result with more winning picks than losing picks.; This is really not that bad of a pick. I think investors are scared about the capex needed but at least they are offering a real life saving service and is massively difficult to build from the ground up. The moat is large and unlikely other players will enter this space.; 100% 

I mean these companies are cyclical anyways, so buying into weakness tends to be the move. That's the thing I try to express to anyone here that are looking into them, that these need to be viewed as long term, since auto and industrial markets in the semi space have not bottomed and there was a super cycle over the last few years. 

However, long term wise, you will probably be happy buying these names now.; I believe it's a huge percentage of their profit though. I don't have the number off hand.; If you look at those companies they are still growing top line double+ that of COST and their profit margins are up similarly or more as well. 

PLUS they are STILL trading at lower multiples.; Thanks for the information. I just sold it. I'll continue to watch it for an opportunity to re-enter. It offsets my loss from TMDX which I just realized, so it works out.; I don’t see what that has to do with my comment or why you think I don’t know how healthcare works. Every corporation performance is tied to policy. Tariffs, subsidies, taxes, regulations… all impact company performance; I agree about capex, and also TAM concerns... If growth comes back strong next Q narrative will flip again I think; Both are majorly shareholder friendly as well. Sadly, in a correction these will get hit too despite already being well off their highs for the year.; Not correct.  But you’re also now teleporting the goalposts to suddenly care about other metrics.  Your original beef was literally “How’s it make sense” for subscription companies to have a 60x multiple.  I showed how it made incredible sense and gains for investors to own 60x or even 135x subscription names.

I don’t own COST or care if anyone does or doesn’t.  I’m just correcting the misinformation.; Right, I forget my second reason: when it dropped below its accumulation line on Thursday, investors didn't choose to buy more below fair value. Instead, they sold off hard - that portends a slow decline in the next few weeks and months.; [removed]"

AAPL The Buyback machine,"[AAPL Shares Outstanding 2015-2024](https://preview.redd.it/x8mz301v4j6e1.png?width=2379&format=png&auto=webp&s=5465bd515fa9d34f24efc5049a92eee43db7e71c)

I kinda got this idea in my head that AAPL is a company without much growth left and have been thinking about lightening up my position on it.

So I decided to make some graphs to figure out what to think and because pictures easy raw data hard. 

First off I was curious what apple's shares outstanding looked like. I know their buy back program is massive and I also know they're not growing top line revenue but are spending a ton on buybacks so this was a good place to start. Considering the share price has also been going up a lot and their market cap is massive so I thought buybacks might have a negligible effect. Wow was I wrong. The shares outstanding are down like 36% in ten years! I couldn't ask for a better looking chart. At this rate it'll all be bought back in like 18.9 more years.

Then I was obviously curious about the EPS and decided to graph that. I was less surprised about how this turned out but it did still offer some insights. I hadn't seen before that they had multiple recent periods of EPS decline that they managed to turn around in big ways. And their EPS since covid is surprisingly down less than I thought so that's not so bad.

It doesn't change my opinion that their product lines are basically stagnant and not exactly innovative on a level that would spur a ton of growth, who tf needs another slimmer iPhone, iPad etc and I think that's a pretty widely held belief given the charts.

However, it's pretty crazy to see that they've bought back a 3rd of their shares in the past 9 years. Also pretty wild to see how its EPS has grown despite not a lot of innovation.

Lastly I was curious how their wearables revenue was doing because I heard recently about the FDA approving AirPods to be hearing devices which is probably a huge market? IDK but what I do know is hearing aids are stupid expensive compared to $200 air pods so this could be big. So far it looks like wearables is doing about $9B a quarter so if growth in that picked up it could be meaningful

All in all I think I keep my position the same, especially considering most of it is through SPYG which has AAPL and NVDA nearly the same weights which kinda strikes me as a yin and yang sorta situation.

I might skim some profit here and there but I don't over analyze companies like Apple. They are a company that makes its investors money over and over and over. ; APPL is a ""stay rich"" equity, the shares won't tank over long period. 

This company can acquire innovation by buying the companies off. So doesn't matter if said company is stagnant, it has enough war chest to last a long long time (long means next 40 years or thereabouts).; I have a firm belief that apples next move is wearable health care. They are consolidating so much health care data on the masses with the Apple Watch to completely change healthcare. 

I think people are missing this. Long holder here.; I've held APPL since 2006.  Buy and never sell, honestly.; I love this:

>It doesn't change my opinion that their product lines are basically stagnant and not exactly innovative 

So how do you frame the watch and airpods who were introduced as products in 2015 and 2016 respectively and now totally dominate their respective markets? 

Another way to look at it is to think about other companies trying to compete with Apple on wearables. There are effectively none that can wield Apple's combination of the ecosystem and logistics. Anyone inventing anything useful will have to face that juggernaut if Apple chooses to make a version of it.; Well obviously their earnings per share will grow if they're buying back shares. With less shares you lower the denominator while flat earnings, the nominator, can remain flat and still grow the bottom line. So.. imagine rather than dividing 1/3, you're now dividing 1/2. I'm not sure why this is a revelation in your post?; In theory I will be the only shareholder in 18.9 years. I never knew the path to trillionaire was so easy.; Buybacks directly increase earnings per share; No growth 30+ pe lol

Must be too much money floating around still; Love how AAPL keeps buying back its own shares! 🍏💰; Overall Apple just needs to keep up with the buybacks while improving their margins with their service revenue. If they keep doing that they will be fine.; [deleted]; Stupid general question: How is it determined which shares are bought back when buybacks occur?  And how does it impact someone who may only hold a stock indirectly, like through an ETF?; I have been slowing selling as price marches higher in my Roth. I will continue to do so. It’s a company with owning but there are better names out there with more compelling risk/reward.; Apple is a Cha-Ching, cha-ching machine !!!; When a company pays dividends and buys back stock, it hasn’t got anything left in it.

Apple has become the Coca-Cola of tech. Their products stagnate and their development is minuscule, incremental and will be overtaken.

The most obvious indicator to me is how iOS has lost its cutting edge to Android. Only the security perspective remains and Google really started doing something about it this year: https://security.googleblog.com/2024/05/io-2024-whats-new-in-android-security.html

Apple is still very good at designing hardware. Especially expensive, good looking hardware.

Sorry for the dumb metaphor but it's waaaaay past my bedtime lol.

P.s 
When I do agree with a chunk of the assessment I think the near cult following apple has in its base consumers. Is being undervalued. They bitch a moan about what ever they don't like on there current iPhone and yet...It's not even a thought to them, they need new phone,watch, computer,etc... they had right for apple.; When Buffett sold like half his stake, it was the first time I ever really wondered about his age.; look at it in the AI race, not quite at the top

there have been apple like companies before, like GE in the 70s, IBM in the 2000s, nobody could imagine a world without them, but times do change and it might be that other industries / companies just outgrow todays champions.

if you do understand the business, the moat, leadership etc do pick stocks.

 Just bear in mind the closer you get to the 10y mark, you hit Buffets wager of not beating 'the market'. Are you in the 10th percentile and can you stand there in the next 10 or more years ?; I agree, seems like big growth to be had undercutting the current overpriced and shitty health devices; I mean you'll have to sell one day, why buy when you'll never sell; They did innovate with the Vision Pro as well. Even though it wasn't as popular as expected, they're going in the right direction. 

I hope they don't give up on it and instead, try to make a cheaper version of glasses.; Plus the m1 MacBooks in 2020 brought an insane boost in performance compared to the intel chips. 
 
Their year to year upgrades aren’t always going to be worthwhile, but to say they aren’t innovating is absurd.; Also their products have a finite life expectancy.  The constant security and tech innovation of online existence forces their products to become paperweights in 5-7 years.  In which case the user usually says “hey it works but it aged out, I’ll give up my IPhone 6 for the 16”.; ... *fewer* shares; You can’t possibly be the only shareholder when I’ll be right there with you. I hope not to touch my shares for the next 20 years.; honestly fair enough, a 30 PE with mostly flat EPS growth is kinda scary. EPS is up like 100% in 5 years but it all happened in 2021; That would cause mass exodus of employees, either by finding another employer or retiring.; They buy shares on the open market just like you and me; who's overtaken Coke in that world?; I've kept it steady since 2019. 450 shares the dividend isn't great but covers a few date nights a year or the occasional stripper 😂; No company in history had their moats. Every single teen wants an iPhone, that means apple services, applecare, wearables, macbooks and iPad. All locked in.

Once theyre a little bit older , siri speakers, homekit everything.

Those “small” dividends in 2013 are not small now.; Include their revolutionary apple silicon in their hardware like laptops etc that everyone is trying to catch up with ARM architecture. Apple will keep on living for a long time.; i agree with you that it's a good business today, exactly for the reasons you mention. though some investors would complain their growth completely stopped.

but for the next 20 years.. i am not so sure. 20y ago apple did not have the iphone at all, amazon was just a online bookstore, netflix was a video renting store. could anyone have guessed how they would evolve 20y later ? not me at least; Very Americanistic view, and utterly wrong. Apple isn't hip with the kids anymore, it's your technofobic old mom or grandma's phone. Sibce elder use it kids and youths want to avoid it.



Also they're so far behind in AI and features it feels you're using yesteryears tech. All at a price point where you got to pay a lot for a former great brand, all while inflation went haywire. Nah, Apple got 50% of USA by the balls but the rest of the work isn't smoking it. Certainly not the echo system, don't know any iPhone user that owns a mac/pad...; How do they pay interest on the loan? Other income?; Sadly agreed. 

But, they can update it and improve on it for the right demographic at the right price tag.; Did you try it? It is insane.; There is enough volume for them to just buy shares that are being sold anyway.; I quit smoking about 20 years ago when my pack of Marlboro Reds were around $3.60/pack.

From time to time I'll ask how much they are now when I stop into a place that sells them. Current price: more than $10/pack now.; Stock picking is a game of educated guessing. I just see whats around me when I travel and almost everyone who ‘made it’ seems to be stuck in that ecosystem. 

So you know my guess; You dont know a single person with both an iphone and an ipad/macbook?

You must not know many people.; Your right even if the Americans can't understand how much more popular Android is everywhere else.; yes, of course i tried it.; Same"
Duplicated ACAT transfer question.,"Hey guys, 

I initiated an ACAT transfer to brokerage A and it failed a few times due to random errors like unsettled funds so I told my brokerage to cancel any attempts to transfer to brokerage A.  I also told brokerage A to not initiate any more requests on my behalf.  Both my bank and brokerage A agreed and all was settled.

I think submit an ACAT to brokerage B and everything goes off without a hitch.  The shares arrive in brokerage B at the scheduled time, but then I receive an email from brokerage B stating that my transfer is complete as well.  I now have duplicate shares in two different brokerages.

I called all 3 banks and they said that everything looks good and is finalized on their end.  I told them about the duplicate funds and my bank only sees the transfer to brokerage A (which I cancelled) and nothing to brokerage B.  We together opened a ticket with APEX clearing house and got them on the phone.  They too stated that everything looked great from their end and they can see nothing wrong.  

Now I am sitting here with shares I did not purchase.  What do I do now to remedy this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hd25kt/duplicated_acat_transfer_question/,2,2024-12-13 03:28:34,

Etc; Highly doubt that. Capitalism is naturally moving towards monopoly without government intervention, and so is technological advancement. The biggest companies will naturally make up a larger portion of the economy over time.

US government doesn’t mind though. Global monopoly of US businesses outweigh the drawbacks brought to the local economy.; Or when Dump gets into office. He tanks anything he touches. He did it once and left unscathed( not really). He lost daddy’s money and MeeMaw the Intel Baller is rolling in her grave!; Bruh you're missing the entire point.

Their GPUs are the backbone of every data center running AI workloads. That's why their revenue jumped 122% YoY.

Look at all these [modular data centers being built](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mizuho-modular-data-centers-power-171105497.html) just to handle AI computing. Every single one needs NVDA chips. Microsoft, Google, Meta - they're all Jensen's customers now.

This isn't some startup burning cash on a chatbot. This is industrial-grade computing infrastructure that companies are fighting to get their hands on. The AI hype might be real but NVDA's profits are even more real.; it would first be important to distinguish between ""AI"" and LLM's. LLM have efficiency benefits for sure. I know people including myself in a variety of professions that use them. They can probably replace 10% - 15% of the office workforce no problem. 

AI is used in an incredible amount of fields right now and doing amazing things.; Think about like this, you can either replace or enhance the productivity of your white collar workforce.

That's how the economy was built. It was built off the profits made by select few men who had political ties that the government favored. 

This is just the modern tech version. I mean there is a common philosophical take that we are not living in capitalism, but in technofeudalism.

I've said for years it's a corptocracy, but it certainly is more tech driven than my take on it was.; And where does the AI make money for these companies? What happens if these companies figure out they are losing money and stop buying the chips? Or if they copy them and make their own?; Wouldn’t it be a technoligarchy; It's going to take a while for people to realize these gpts don't really do much work.; I work at a large international bank and we already replaced hundreds of people with AI...

You guys have no idea how low level office and even it work can be  replaced with AI already.; AI is definitely going to replace outsourcing menial tasks to Indian contracting companies like Cognizant, which is what most large companies are doing on the back end for sorting through emails, handling simple requests, etc. 

You might not ever even deal with one of these workers as a customer but they do a ton of grunt work. Most of this stuff is super easy, it’s stuff that needs a human to read and process (email requests etc) but 90% of them are black and white simple stuff. Think changing a mailing address on file, updating contact info, adding a vehicle to an auto insurance policy, things like that. Anything more complex gets kicked onshore to the actual customer service team.

At least at my company (large Fortune 500 insurance company - not health insurance) we contract with Cognizant and have been trying to get rid of them for years due to the cost of their contract and the frequent QA errors. This is one of many, many jobs that AI could easily replace with higher average quality and lower costs. 

It’s going to be huge.; Most of the tools needed to create futuristic job stealing robots are there. We currently have Ai that can talk to you in a video chat responding to what it sees on camera, Ai that can created plans for tasks, and neural nets/Nvidia software that can pilot robot bodies. 

The main issue is finalizing the robot bodies, fine tuning the Ai/controls, mass production, etc. All things that’ll happen with some struggling and effort in the next 1-3 years.; You're completely missing how the AI industry actually works. These companies aren't ""losing money"" on AI - they're rushing to build massive infrastructure because AI is transforming their entire business models. Look at [Meta and Microsoft's soaring profits](https://finance.yahoo.com/m/151e1d00-6dbe-3a50-9943-588cd97b8c0d/can-palantir-stock-become-the.html) from AI deployment.

Making their own chips? That's not happening anytime soon. NVIDIA's tech lead is massive - they've spent decades perfecting their GPU architecture and CUDA ecosystem. The [revenue numbers don't lie](https://beyondspx.com/article/nvidia-the-ai-powerhouse-dominating-the-semiconductor-landscape) - $60.92B annual revenue with $29.76B net income. They're absolutely crushing it.

You think companies spending billions on AI infrastructure are just gonna suddenly stop? The [AI chip market is growing 38% annually](https://finance.yahoo.com/m/45543e0d-b676-36ac-97cd-159c873dd859/prediction%3A-amd-stock-will.html). This isn't some temporary trend - it's a fundamental shift in computing. NVDA isn't selling picks and shovels during a gold rush, they're selling the entire mining operation.; It won’t be as big as you think. Also it will take years to implement if not decades. As this happens they don’t have unlimited money. This stinks of dotcom bubble tbh; Replacing some outsourcing to India for low-skill jobs is not a disruptive technology. I get that it may be impactful for your company, but it's just not that big a deal. The ""big deal"" or ""disruptive"" technologies are ones like the internet, or cars. This doesn't look like ""company XYZ is able to cut ABC department""; it looks like ""company XYZ and its 10 competitors are all gone in 5 years and replaced by two radical new companies that make 10x more than those previous companies put together.""

A perfect example of this right now is robo taxies. They exist, and no one cares. And why should they care? Why did \*anyone\* ever care about self-driving? We can all already drive or take buses. Self-driving is a convenience, it's filed under ""great to have"" but it isn't disruptive. It isn't faster. It isn't cheaper. Let alone much faster or much cheaper. LLMs fall into this category, and they still haven't even paid the piper on training and inference costs.; Replacing menial tasks is really not a big cost improvement since contract low quality outsourced work is… low cost.; I think you don't realize how clueless most people are...

Low skilled white collar workers and creative people will have their jobs change heavily in the coming 10y.; I think we're in agreement that it's going to be a big industry and that it will continue to see growth. All I'm saying is that everyone is treating it like a disruptive technology, and it's not. It's just a new tool. To draw an analogy, so-called AI is more like Excel than personal computing in general. But everyone wants to believe it's the latter so that they can make a giant pile of money."
Apple’s New Moves and Updates On $490M Investor Settlement,"Hey everyone, if you missed it, they seem to be diving into something straight out of a Steve Jobs dream—developing smart home devices (like a TV or similar) powered by its new Apple Intelligence. It’s still early days, but this could be a real development next year.



About the settlement over Tim Cook’s 2018 comments on China’s sales— you might already know about it, but there’s been an update, so here’s a quick recap for anyone who missed it. 

  


Back in 2018, Cook mentioned during an earnings call that while Apple faced sales issues in countries with high inflation (like Brazil and Russia), there were “no issues in China.” But just days later, Apple cut production orders from suppliers, so I think it was obviously otherwise.



And just two months later, Apple shocked everyone with its first announcement about the revenue cut since the iPhone establishment in 2007, causing AAPL to drop by 10% and resulting in 70B losses.



This led to multiple lawsuits accusing Apple of misleading investors. While Apple has consistently denied any wrongdoing, the company recently agreed to a $490M settlement, even before a court hearing.



But here’s the update, I just found out that even though the deadline already passed, they are taking late claims on this. So if you were hit by this, you can check it out and [file for it](https://11thestate.com/cases/apple-investor-settlement).

  


However, do you think it’s a good idea to start developing new products like this? And does that half a billion even come close to covering the $70 billion loss?

Missed NVIDIA Surge? Three AI potential stocks are waiting for your chance!,"This year, stocks of the “Big 7,” including Amazon, Meta Platforms, Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft, Nvidia, and Apple, have soared, including a nearly 3% gain on Wednesday. Tech ETFs have hit 29 new highs this year.



Oracle: strong growth, attractive valuation



Oracle shares fell 6% to $178 after reporting fiscal second-quarter earnings on Monday. Nonetheless, its shares have doubled since the end of 2022. This share price decline is a natural market reaction to high expectations.



The earnings report showed good prospects for Oracle future growth. Quarterly revenue rose 8.6% year-on-year to $14.1 billion, with cloud revenue up 24% to $5.9 billion and cloud infrastructure revenue reaching a further $2.4 billion. Oracle is migrating customers from traditional data storage to its efficient AI-enabled services. Future third-quarter revenue is expected to grow 8%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate growth of up to 10%



Oracle cloud infrastructure business is growing faster than the industry average, and overall annual revenue growth is expected to remain above 10% going forward. Although AI-related investments will put pressure on margins in the short term, analysts expect its average annual earnings per share growth rate to reach 18% over the next four years. Its current price-to-earnings ratio of 27 times expected earnings over the next 12 months is significantly lower than the average for the U.S. software industry, but its growth outlook is much stronger and the stock has room for further upside



Teradyne: Robotics and Chip Testing



Shares of Teradyne, a $19 billion robotics and chip-testing equipment maker, are down about 27% from their summer high of $163.21, and currently stand at $120. A recent slowdown in capital spending by industrial customers has led to a deceleration in growth in its industrial business, but the long-term outlook remains positive



Sales in this segment are expected to recover as industrial customers resume investment in automation equipment. Meanwhile, growing demand for AI chips is driving increased demand for chip test equipment. Total revenue for the third quarter increased 5% to $737 million. The analysis predicts that the market in which Teradyne is located could reach $19 billion by the end of the century, with its industry position strong and only Tokyo-based Advantest as its main competitor



Analysts expect Teradyne revenue and earnings per share to grow to $4.1 billion and $5.99, respectively, by 2026. If the company proves to be on a good trajectory, shares are expected to rally. Its price-to-earnings ratio is currently 28 times, down from a yearly high of 37 times



AMD: The AI chip chaser



AMD shares fell 39% to $127 from a high of $227.30 in March as AI chip sales missed expectations. However, the company recently raised its full-year revenue guidance to $5 billion from $4.5 billion



AMD CEO Zifeng Su said the long-term size of the AI chip market could exceed $500 billion. NVIDIA currently occupies a $100 billion market, but customers still need to diversify their supply chains, and AMD is the second-biggest option after NVIDIA



Analysts expect AMD annual sales of data center chips, including AI chips, to grow 36% to $31 billion by 2027. A lower price-to-earnings ratio (26x vs. Nvidia 33x) also provides upside to its stock price



These three companies are uniquely positioned for long-term growth potential in the AI wave, and may be worth considering as a “second tier” for investors who missed Nvidia surge

There will also be secondary or long-term effects in prices that have not yet been reacted to; You are Right my friend! It will hit a bubble burst just like .com. It’s inevitable. The only question is when?!!; Then ask the AI to write it for you. Joker; ""Market has not fully reacted"" is the same thing as saying market hasn't priced it in.  That's not what he asked.  What he's asking is why you think that is the case.; This implies you have better information than people who are paid to pick stocks, which is dubious; So you just copy pasted article from Barron's?; if anyone could figure that out they'd be fabulously wealthy. I'm not educated enough to make that bet tho so I'll just invest defensively in the meantime; You & I both!"
How come AAPL isn’t affected by the rise of the AI market?,"One might wonder how AAPL has managed to remain largely unaffected by the rapid rise of AI technology. Unlike the competitors, Apple doesn’t seem to be actively showing as of today any developed LLM yet, just announcements. Meanwhile,  besides OpenAI, Google every other day is improvindg their Gemini, Microsoft has firmly planted its foot in the door with its heavy involvement in OpenAI. Third parties like Meta and Elon Musk have already into the LLM market as competitors. All in all, most released systems are already at the 2nd or 3rd generation, at least. Yet, nothing of the sort appears to be happening within Apple. Despite this, AAPL hasn’t suffered any major setbacks; in fact, it has been steadily growing in recent years. What’s keeping Apple from losing ground? What’s your take on this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hchkfs/how_come_aapl_isnt_affected_by_the_rise_of_the_ai/,57,2024-12-12 10:40:06,"Its the same reason BMW doesn’t own an oil refinery; I think AAPL has decoupled itself from the AI game. And it could be a smart move. AI in these relatively early stages is still an expensive game. AAPL seems content to focus on the consumer product/software aspects of their business which are cash cows, and they can monetise AI in the future by integrating other developers' apps onto their platform anyway.; Apple is up 30% this year by the way; Probably because it is just not an area that has been a strength for Apple.

I suspect what we will ultimate see is on Agent win majority of the market.  I believe that will come from Google.

The agent will ultimately be offered on Apple products with Google sharing in the huge profits generated.

It will be very, very profitable for both companies.; [deleted]; This is a strange post OP.  Simply put do you make money when you train an LLM or when you deploy an LLM.  Today the money to be made in the former is cornered by nvidia.  What about the latter -- it's strongly in the hands of those who own the hardware or the entire ecosystem. That's apple.  You can see the whispers today, a significant portion of die area going to neural processing units (intel, apple ... you name it).  Only question is where will the giant share of money be made in training or the deployment.  Your guess is probably as good as anybody else.; Does Apple announcing AI as “Apple Intelligence” and the stock price rising after they made the announcement not count?; Apple makes phones. And everyone on the planet wants one of their phones.; Apple is the Gatekeeper. No need to have the best LLM when will be accessing other the existing ones through your devices.; The competition's AI tools and features are losing them billions of dollars and there is no profitable feature in sight until the technology improves, which is not a given.; What do you mean, they are trading at >40 PE (TTM) xD; Define “unaffected”; If it weren’t for the AI craze Apple wouldn’t be even trading at these levels, company barely grows and yet is up 30% YTD, what do you want more ?; AI is going to  replace phones?; Because you'll use chatgpt on your iphone.; They'll probably just buy a finished one later.  Why spend billions on development when you can spend 100s of billions on buying a company instead?; They have their own ecosystem; Because Apple is not a tech company it is a consumer luxury company.; All the big LLM offerings you mention are massively unprofitable and it's unclear when or if they will provide enough utility to users that users want to actually pay enough money to fund the cost of the queries they run plus the ongoing R&D costs of improving the models.  Apple mostly avoids that kind of game, which is why they are trying to run on-device AI models for as many use cases as they can.  The results won't be as good as the cloud based alternatives, but those alternatives operate at a net loss which Apple is not interested in.  Apple will partner with them to feed them users so they can keep burning cash attempting to monetize.  OpenAI is the first partner Apple is integrating such that users can opt in to querying ChatGPT, and there will likely be others.  Perhaps eventually those partners will be profitable, it really doesn't matter to Apple unless they start building consumer electronics.; Don’t ask questions. Just keep buying. ; They own the platform which so the real moat; Ai.  lol.; Isn't appl cowgirling Microsoft for openai?; Because Apple was already over valued; These LLMs are being commodified. Look at all the models even open source models out now. Apple doesn't need to compete in developing this.; [deleted]; Apple just announced partnership today. Where you been?; Because New iphone color IS the best innovation they Can pull UP thèse days; Once you get a Wallstreet nickname like FAANG or MAG 7 the rules no longer apply. I think at this price they are afraid changing the script will crash the nations pension funds; Apple has no AI game; Apple customers are delusional....AAPL investors are delusional. Its going to be a very hard and long wakeup call before they realize AAPL has jumped the shark.; AAPL is just a marketing company of the products made in China.; Lol...instead they come up with heated seat subscriptions.  Brilliant.; Nvidia seem to be the only ones that have found a way to make money off AI right now, sort of like the people who went to California during the gold rush but brought chickens instead of pick axes so they could sell eggs at ten cents each when the national average was 20 cents per dozen.; I disagree. Apple has been in the AI game for sometime now and IMO ahead of the curve. AI model, they might be behind.  

They got edge device AI. Watch, Phone, MacBook, etc. now they launched their own AI data center.

Look at hardware design and planning. Not coincidental. 

They are more measured in launching software solutions.; Just like blockbuster detached itself from digital media ; Unless AI makes a paradigm shift occur in the device application market… say to headsets and neural links?; Bro still hasn't found out about monthly charts; And announced Apple intelligence with OpenAI as a partner and have released many ai features over the past few months. Open your eyes. 👀; 🤦‍♂️; Redditors: “That is classified information! Where are you getting this information from????”; QQQ is up 33.5%.  Why take the risk of a single stock when there is no reward?; Unless the computers move into AR glasses or neurolinked directly into our brains; Do you really think that a single on-chip dedicated area can actually implement equivalent AI systems than those LLMs now running on entire NVidia chips farms? The local processing will at most allow for some limited machine learning more traditional function, possibly to be applied to image or sound processing, I think. So no, this is not enough of a response on the part of  Apple to the rise of larg AI systems.; Need to define if we are talking consumer or enterprise?

In the Enterprise AI is already very profitable for Google and Microsoft.     Realize they are the shovel providers and the companies using the AI might or might not be profitable but that does not change the fact it is very profitable for Google and Microsoft.   More for Google as they have the TPUs and so much fatter margins as Microsoft has to pay the huge Nvidia tax.

Take a look at GCP and Azure numbers over the last couple of quarters.   AI has enabled Google to have accelerated growth rates for GCP.  Last quarter it was 35%.

The place it is yet profitable is on the consumer side.  But that is where there will ultimately be the biggest profits.

We will all interact with an Agent at some point and this will be very, very profitable for the company that provides.

I expect Google to win this space.  They are just well positioned and had the vision to do the things needed like the TPUs.

I would then expect the Google agent to be offered on Apple products and Google sharing in the profits generated with Apple.; Latest trailing PE of 40 is due the one time EU tax penalty payment. Forward PE is around 33-34. Which is definitely high, but comparable to other mag7s.; What they have done with Apple Silicon is absolutely astounding.  They’re running rings around everyone in the SoC space.; Not a tech company? They supply the planet with tech devices lol; Worry not. It's just a matter of time when Apple comes up with touchscreen subscriptions or some shit like that.; Nvidia GPU + CUDA gave them a massive headstart.; Juries out on GenAI But the need for high performance computing is inescapable and NVDA are all over that. ; Quite typical of Apple to sit back while the entire market rushes into a new sector, and come into that sector in a much more strategic/calculated way. It's always been Apple's MO; Blockbuster never adapted and that led to their demise, but the jury is still out on how Apple can become the consumer touchpoint for most of these AI use cases. In a gold rush, they're not selling the shovels nor are they digging through the earth. They're the ones creating jewelry out of the gold and selling that to the consumer.; Have you tried those features? It’s trash which is very weird as Apple usually releases polished features compared to their counterparts.; Apple Intelligence has made zero improvement on my life. I’m still hoping for some practical use cases when apple fully unleashes it.


Siri still cant answer most of my questions the way i want it to; Every time I try Siri it just searches the web and shows me a bunch of crappy links about PCs. It can't answer anything about how to do anyone the Mac. I have never gotten a useful reply from Siri, not once.; Haven’t seen a single one of the features; zoom out; So, in its very early stages, something like Vision Pro…  

Never bet against Apple.; Honestly though, a phone is less intrusive than glasses.; google just released AI glasses; > We will all interact with an Agent at some point and this will be very, very profitable for the company that provides.

Maybe. Maybe not. It's not at all clear that this will happen, because for it to happen the technology has to improve massively and it's not at all certain that things will go that way.; Sure, good point, APPL was trading a long time in early 20s, would say forward PE of 33-34 is still reflecting AI hype
Think about GOOGL, even with recent increase it is trading at what, forward PE 21?; [deleted]; Pretty much. Apple doesn’t usually do things first. But when they make a move they usually do it the best.; It's more about hype, marketing and perception when it comes to the market nowadays. Apple havent been an innovator for yonks, they sell the exact same phone with a slightly better camera every year. ; Has AI generally made an improvement in your life?; Yeah, I know previous gains.

I just sold my MSFT for QQQ.; Kinda hard to see a world where we totally ditch the phones. I hate wearing glasses. I have a VR headset too.; They’re a tech company; makes coding a lot easier. but if you’re writing texts with ai you are demented; No but automation and technology definitely has"
Bought $16.2k worth of calls- Globalstar,"I’ve been following Globalstar (GSAT)  for months At one point, had ~10k shares @ ~$1.8 each.


This company is going to print money in 2025.


Apple is partnered with them and will be bringing satellite communication to their iwatch in 2025.


Tomorrow is Globalstar’s investor day. More good news will make this jump.


I’m holding $16.2k worth of calls.

75x April 17 2025
106x July 18 2025
90x Jan 16 2026
7x Jan 15 2027


Growth in Satellite Communication: The demand for satellite communication services has been increasing, particularly in sectors like IoT (Internet of Things), maritime, agriculture, and remote monitoring. Globalstar offers services in these areas and might benefit from this trend.

Emerging Technologies: The company has been involved in innovative technologies, including partnerships and developments related to 5G, satellite-based internet services, and other next-gen communication services. If they successfully capitalize on these technologies, it could lead to significant growth.

Partnerships and Collaborations: Globalstar has engaged in various partnerships that could enhance its service offerings and market reach. Strategic collaborations can open new revenue streams and provide access to advanced technologies. On the horizon… Apple service, Walmart partnership, Liquid Intelligence Technologies, Magnatech Travel Management Solutions, Nokia and defense contracts with Parsons.

Increased Coverage and Infrastructure: As Globalstar continues to expand its satellite constellation and improve its infrastructure, this could enhance service reliability and attract more customers who need robust communication solutions.

Regulatory Developments: Changes in regulations that favor satellite communications or encourage investments in telecommunications infrastructures could benefit companies like Globalstar.

Market Position: Globalstar has a unique position in the satellite communication market. If they can effectively leverage their advantages, such as niche services and locations where traditional communication methods are inadequate, it could enhance their competitive stance.

Environmental and Social Trends: The growing emphasis on remote work and sustainable practices might increase the need for reliable satellite communication services, especially in underserved markets.

News came out on 11/01 about their deal with Apple being extended and the stock popped about 100% since then

If you plan on buying because you think the Apple deal is worth more. Godspeed.

Just don't want people thinking the Apple news is brand new.; Emerging Tech is a lot of hot air for now. GSAT has bands that only support text, practically very very low data consumption. 5G or data intensive bands are primarily Starlink territory.

6 years investing but there are still open questions,"Hey guys, I’m investing since 2018 and made a lot of profit in those years. I have a bunch of google since before the last split 

NVIDIA, MSFT , apple , msci world 

All fine and dandy. If it continues to grow average 10% forever. I might retire with 40 or just work for fun by then.

But now my big question. I know money looses value through inflation, about 2,5 % (or 7 if you ask the pessimists) and the average growth on the s&p or msci world is 10% at some point those stocks are so much worth it can’t be comprehended.

If you can hold it that long and grow it and your kids can hold it and grow it, etc that is how it works.; Come back Christmas next year and let us know how it worked out for you.; 7 billion in the bank pays you1 Mill a day in interest! GOALS; If you have a well diversified portfolio worth many millions, generating a safe 5% post inflation, yes, it will go on forever, and keep growing and growing... if you leave it alone, and only take out a small slice every year.

That's the key.

If your children, and their children's children, etc. etc. are all smart, know how to adapt (markets change, maybe in 200 years the S&P won't be ""it"", etc.), and don't do stupid shit with the money, congrats, your family is rich forever.

2) Owning individual stocks within the S&P [or any other index] isn’t the same as holding the index. Individual stocks potentially carry a lot of risk.

And inference doesn’t have the same requirements as training. So there could be room for many players. 

AMD is already competitive on inference from a cost perspective. Hence why Meta and Microsoft buy AMD chips to serve models for their internal products (Meta for its social media platforms, Microsoft for Copilot products).; They’re just copying Google’s design via Broadcom; New ChatGPT integration is big; It got leaked early; Amd doesn't have the volume, Intel has been touring AI AI AI AI inferencing inferencing local machine local machine last like 2 years, OEM will just slap budget Intel chips for inferencing; That would make sense.

Apple launches its ChatGPT integration with Siri,"Apple released updates for its iPhone, iPad and Mac software on Wednesday that include a long-awaited ChatGPT integration with Siri.

The ChatGPT integration triggers when users ask Siri complicated questions. When Siri is asked a question that Apple’s software identities as better suited for ChatGPT, it asks the user permission to access the OpenAI service. Apple says that it has built in privacy protections into the feature, and that OpenAI won’t store requests. The integration uses OpenAI’s GPT-4o model.

Apple users don’t need an OpenAI account to make use of the ChatGPT integration, but users can pay for upgraded versions of ChatGPT through Apple. Users can also access ChatGPT through some text menus.

The iOS 18.2 release is a critical milestone for Apple, which is relying on Apple Intelligence to lead the iPhone 16 lineup’s marketing campaign. Apple Intelligence is the company’s suite of artificial intelligence features. Apple first announced the ChatGPT integration back in June.

Apple released the first part of Apple Intelligence in October. Those features included writing tools that can proofread or rewrite text, a new design for Siri that makes the whole phone screen glow and notification summaries.

The company says it will release another update to Apple Intelligence next year that includes significant improvements to Siri, including the ability for it to take actions inside of apps.

Many investors believe that as Apple Intelligence adds features, it will boost iPhone sales, drive an upgrade cycle and potentially cement Apple as a leader in consumer-oriented AI.

The integration is also a major victory for OpenAI as it puts its most important product in front of millions of iPhone users. Neither Apple nor OpenAI have disclosed financial terms for the arrangement.

Users need an iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Pro or any iPhone 16 model to install and use Apple Intelligence, even though the ChatGPT integration primarily uses cloud servers. Owners of iPhones can turn on software updates in the General section of the Settings app.

After updating to the latest Apple software, users who have not yet activated Apple Intelligence can sign up for a waitlist inside the settings app. Users typically receive access to the software within the same day. Their phones will need to download large files, including Apple’s AI models, that the service needs to operate.

The Wednesday updates also include Apple’s image generating app, called Playground, which can create images based on people or prompts, and Image Wand, a feature that allows users to remove objects or flaws from photographs.

That should have been done 6 months ago...; Honestly, its ok, at best. I have used it for a little and although it is better than previous Siri. It is not what it still should be. I think even if ChatGPT completely replaced Siri, it wouldn’t be as good as you would think. Only time will tell; Yawn; Google has completely taken the thunder today with their Gemini release.

Gemini 2.0 Flash is just amazing.  But at the same time going to cost a small fraction to run compared to the other models.  Not just because of the TPUs but because it is a Flash model.; Okay, why can’t I have it on a 13 pro again? It’s not running on the phone, it’s chat gpt; Apple is so far behind in the AI game. Almost embarrassing for a company its size.; it was up and now it's down while everything is still up.; siri sucks.; And still can’t tell you the weather or do simple math the like it could in version 16 and before. 17 and 18 are a disaster. ; Don’t see it on mine; I’ve been waiting so long for this; Excited for this; Fascinating move by Apple! This ChatGPT integration could be a game-changer for how we interact with our devices. As someone deep in the AI space, I'm excited to see how this impacts user experience and app development. It's interesting that they're limiting it to newer iPhones - probably for processing power. I wonder how this will stack up against other AI assistants. Speaking of AI tools, I've been working on Opencord AI for social media engagement, and it's wild to see how quickly this tech is evolving across platforms. Curious to hear others' thoughts on how this might change your daily iPhone use!; ugh; Was planning on buying an iPhone 16 but the delayed and underwhelming reviews on Apple Intelligence have really killed it for me. I’ll likely upgrade to the 17. Hopefully we’ll see a new design and Apple Intelligence will be more figured out by then. ; 6 years ago; It's like that average looking, B-grade celebrity couple that entered a marriage of convenience (e.g. Harry and Meghan), and we're supposed to clap 👏 ; Glad to see Flash is back to being supported; Does Google's proprietary TPUs actually run LLMs better than nVidia GPUs? Have they been benchmarked for the same tasks?; cause they want you to buy a new phone.; Because Tim has leap calls and he wants you to buy his new phone?; ChatGPT is the fall back when the on phone AI is not enough.; You’re mistaken. The majority of the new features  run on your phone except for one optional integration into ChatGPT and web summaries. 

It still requires the new Siri (which runs locally) to try and do things locally before it’ll request ChatGPT for anything.; Same reason that perfectly good devices were falsely software crippled, and then the cover up story was about perfectly good batteries being no good.

The crooks who orchestrated this massive fraud were caught and now serving time in federal prison.  Just kidding.  No justice of any kind happened and those responsible live with insane wealth and blissfully fearless of any consequences.

Edit - because someone will try and saw there were consequences, well yes, they did have to run a time limited promotion offering $60 off the $250 charge to change a $20 battery, a process which drove more profits and profitable upgrades and more e-waste.  So yeah, no actual consequences.; Why being surprised. Isnt this how Apple has always been?; So who's ahead? I'm yet to see a lot of useful AI features, no matter who's making them.; Almost?; Apple has effectively been using AI in their devices for like 5-10 years. It just isn’t called AI and the features have names. 

Please use your brain next time; Hopefully it will be upgraded; The ChatGPT integration looks so bare minimum thrown together.; It is speculated that they are a lot more efficient.  Which would make sense as Google is who invented transformers and they control the entire stack.

The TPUs are also why Google can offer a much larger context window than everyone else.; What new features? They did not show anything.; No, five to six years has been the standard. Starting with the 15 five years is a [formal commitment](https://www.androidauthority.com/iphone-software-support-commitment-3449135/). 

(And unlike Android phones it’s rare that one’s carrier will restrict Apple updates. That’s the upside of homogeneity.); Yup and some of them are just worse versions of the original, like Microsoft’s copilot runs on ChatGPT but it’s a dumber version.; https://aistudio.google.com/live; You don't think ChatGPT is usefull?; Like they did with 17 that broke most Siri features besides timers? The company fired their best engineers for being too expensive. They can no long fix things. They can’t even get Siri working again with basic math and weather. 

Cook claiming breaking math and weather were broken on purpose because of privacy is just lame.  ; You are talking about OS Update and security updates. Not necessarily features.; https://aistudio.google.com/live; That's not a feature, it's just a playground. Where are the actually useful features and tools other than ChatGPT?; That's a product, not a feature. ChatGPT is about the only AI tool I use and it can be quite useful.; Use your camera and talk to it on the live stream part"
Is a trillion dollar valuation possible for Spotify?,"In all the investing subs I am surprised that more people are not mentioning Spotifys 2030 ambition. In 2022 they presented their target for 100 billion in revenue by 2030. They claim they are ahead on their plans so far.

At 4 billion euros in revenue last quarter they obviously have a ways to go. But surprisingly, ads made up just 472€ million of their revenue, while subscribers made up just over 3.5€ billion. What’s more, they have 2.5x as many ad supported users as premium subscribers, meaning they have a ton of room for improving ad revenue. I imagine they are planning on ad revenue growing rapidly in the next 6 years. It seems they could easily double revenue without adding any new users just by growing ad revenue.


I know it’s very speculative, but what is their potential market cap in 2030 if they hit their target? Is it possible that they get above 1 trillion one day? Or is this overly ambitions given the market they are in?

FWIW they have YouTube in their cross hairs. I have been seeing more and more songs that have the „video“ option, and only within the last week I saw that „super simple songs“ recently added a video to their latest song (they are of baby shark fame and one of the biggest creators on YouTube). With podcasts having video and being able to easily monetize that with targeted ads from Spotify, it seems that the line between Spotify and YouTube is becoming blurred. 

It seems to me like Spotify is a good long term play and can be anywhere from 5x to 10x 6 years from now.

The biggest risk is competition. But Apple Music is really just for Apple users, and even then Apple users seem to prefer Spotify. Globally it seems like there is a lot of room for consolidation. For example, Siri is really just USA, and other countries also have their own audio apps. But globally Spotify seems to be the clear winner, and I would imagine that consolidation happens.

What are your thoughts? Is Spotify a good long term investment?

Edit: also AI is a huge risk. I’ve been using Suno and it is pretty great. But Spotify is also known as a leading tech company. Google „agile the Spotify way“. Many European companies are trying to emulate their approach to the agile process. Meaning that I also have some faith in their ability to innovate and execute on the software end

Edit 2: luckily, with stocks, we can put our money where our mouth is. I think they’ll 5x-10x in 6 years. Also: the projected global ad revenue is projected to reach 1 trillion in 2030. Due to ai, I see Google search ad revenue decreasing. In addition to premium subscribers, there is an absolutely massive opportunity in ad revenue which they have yet to tap into",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hbsm2a/is_a_trillion_dollar_valuation_possible_for/,0,2024-12-11 13:43:05,"No; Absolutely not

At most it begins to match Netflix. At MOST; With the advent of artificial intelligence in music looking that far out I don't know what's going to happen in the music industry and how all of that is going to Play out to me personally I'm staying away from anything that is music related as far as investing is concerned.; I can't see myself ever using anything else... Fuck carrying around those 5 CD books.; Im targetting to be a billionaire by next christmas.; The day they raised their prices is the day I switched to youtube premium. I was debating it for a couple weeks, and that's what pushed me over the edge.

Hard no.; No; When you put it like this it all sounds reasonable but checking on that stock I get mixed positive reports and opinions...proceed with caution I also read.; In the scenario of spotify at $1trillion, what’s the value of $1? Money printing could make anything worth anything in USD.; I don’t think you know the huge difference/distance between 4billion, 100billion and 1 trillion. You might want to start there.; It seems about 4 years behind Netflix’s growth, and I think will follow along. So Netflix is currently at 390 billion market cap, and I think SPOT will be there in 2028. I would argue that Netflix has more competition. Personally i don’t really use Netflix anymore and only find things I’m interested in on HBO, Hulu, and Disney.

But Spotify to me looks like in a better position to have control over the audio media (music, podcasts, audiobooks) and now they are adding video.


Let’s see. 

RemindMe! 1000 days Spotify at 400 billion; That is true. I also see suno as a concern and potential competitor. But at the same time, I’ve seen people use suno to create songs and Spotify to publish and monetize. It could be an advantage to have a platform that has AI music while also allowing a user to filter out all AI generated content.

I saw that Spotify was also doing some integrations with notebook lm for AI generated podcasts. 

One thing is for sure: Spotify is embracing AI meaning they are unlikely to be left behind. Hopefully they can navigate it correctly; But this is anecdotal. They’ve actually increased premium users faster than projected after the priced hike.

Also, does YouTube premium have audiobooks? This is the killer service IMO; I don’t even know why I respond, but anyway: 
- 4 billion is in euros and their last quarterly revenue
- 100 billion is their yearly target 6 years from now (so 25 billion a quarter)
- 1 trillion is the market cap they could reach one day, considering that in just 6 years they target 100 billion revenue.; I will be messaging you in 2 years on [**2027-09-07 13:14:43 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2027-09-07%2013:14:43%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hbsm2a/is_a_trillion_dollar_valuation_possible_for/m1ipah3/?context=3)

"Overvalued Companies (PLTR, SHOP, CRWD)","The market right now is filled with young companies reaching impressive highs and earning steep valuations. Each has its own story, and for investors, the challenge is finding the next Mag 7 or something close to it. 

I’m curious to hear your thoughts on which of these companies might have what it takes to rise to the top and why. Some examples I’m considering are PLTR, SHOP, CRWD, APP, RKLB, and a few others. I wasn’t around during the early days of Amazon, Apple, and similar companies, but I imagine they also went through cycles of intense enthusiasm, stock price spikes, and corrections. Could we be seeing something similar play out with these names?",https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1hblmx7/overvalued_companies_pltr_shop_crwd/,24,2024-12-11 05:38:42,"Palantir has what it takes to become the ""Microsoft of AI.""

I invested in 2020 due to exposure to their software before they went public.

Here is a solid ""DD"" from someone else that hits on some key points I believe in:

""$PLTR valuation makes ZERO sense But then why do institutions keep buying it? What do they know that you don't? I work in BIG DATA analytics and let me share the secrets of Palantir in the most basic way Palantir has monopoly on Automated Governance, serving as the ultimate Operating System for Data and Global Decision-Making. The world is starting to see the massive benefits of AI agents developed on the Palantir platform, which boost efficiency, drive higher earnings, and outpace the competition. 

Over time, Palantir will reign supreme among AI agents, with all other AI entities eventually integrating into the powerful Palantir Ecosystem. This is just the beginning. Think of $MSFT Windows. Before Windows, people relied of MS-DOS (which is another OS) and before that it was CP/M which were really bad Operating Systems. The Tools didn't talk to each other. You couldn't multitask. You couldn't perform Technical Analysis while at the same time executing the trades. You couldn't stream your games on Youtube while playing it. It was limited and fragmented into separate sessions and executable files (.exe). You were LIMITED, much less efficient. It is exactly the same for all Governments and Corporations and right now. They've grown so big, beyond scalability. Tons of data are being generated by too many programs, locations and departments. Each source of data have different expertise of people with totally separated ownerships and power over the data (e.g. Business Dept. vs Manufacturing Dept). Just like it was inefficient or impossible for MS-DOS to transfer data from one application to another in real time. It is inefficient to transfer the data from one department to another for a simple decision-making. It takes so much time, resources and too many meetings. It could take days if not weeks to get it done. Why? Because of ownership and qualifications over the data. If you don't work in the Business department then you don't qualify to play with that data. 

If you don't work in manufacturing department, you can't own the data. So in order to unify the two data sources. You are reliant to different groups. That's only one small example. Think of your responsibilities in your own household. One partner is probably more accurate on handling the grocery list and school events while the other is more reliable in fixing cars and backyards. As a 3rd person (perhaps an accountant), you would be reliant on each of them to provide the receipts for their own spendings. This is where Palantir's Ontology kicks in. Voila, it unifies every single data source and specialties within the company. Think of Palantir's Ontology as a digital map for a company's data. It organizes all the information in a way that makes sense, connecting different pieces of data to each other and to real-world things, like products, equipment, or customer orders. Imagine you have a messy room with all your stuff scattered around. 

The Ontology is like a system that helps you organize everything neatly, so you can find what you need quickly and easily. It's a way to make sense of a lot of data and use it effectively. Palantir solves scalability and reduces big corporations and governments down to its core principles, to make a good decision. With Palantir, it is much easier to grow, digitally. “There were 5 exabytes of information created between the dawn of civilization through 2003, but that much information is now created every two days.” — Eric Schmidt “Information is the oil of the 21st century, and analytics is the combustion engine.” — Peter Sondergaard “Without big data, you are blind and deaf and in the middle of a freeway.” — Geoffrey Moore Companies don't like to be blind and deaf in the middle of a freeway nor to be underperforming to be punished by the stock market. 

Eventually, all the data we generate will be more complex and too much for humans to digest them all. We will eventually need a AI to do that job for us but more importantly we need a stable platform for AI agents to stand on, you can't throw an AI agent in the water and expect to swim. AIs need.. ONTOLOGY. Think of AI agents as Culinary Chefs. The Palantir AI chefs will have all the ingredients and tools in ONE COMMON PLACE to make magic happen, enabling on-the-fly decision-making without the hindrances of bureaucracy or data ownership issues. 

This unity is the game-changer. Palantir is... A Super Integration Company And that is vastly more superior and transformative than the hype of 'AI' You can hire the best Chef in the world but without fresh ingredients and tools, he will never be effective. So that's why it's not just about AI agents, it's more about what's available to them, a unified kitchen full of many ingredients, recipes, assistants and tools. PALANTIR ONTOLOGY is precisely that Kitchen, an Operating System of Data and Global Decision-Making Just like how $MSFT has become essential to our every day lives, $PLTR will become essential to every single businesses and governments in the world. It's just matter time. The monopoly is here to stay. Is $PLTR valuation through the roofs? Hell Yeah, but what's the alternative? NONE""

Then it balloons to the 70s; Many of the big names all work together with Palantir in this ecosystem already actually.

Otherwise you just making the government rich with your taxes. Shopify will be around forever.; I understand it. I think my portfolio was just getting overweight the risky names and i was seeing opportunity in the more stable names such as Google and MSFT and Amazon."
"Overvalued Companies (PLTR, SHOP, CRWD)","
The market right now is filled with young companies reaching impressive highs and earning steep valuations. Each has its own story, and for investors, the challenge is finding the next Mag 7 or something close to it. 

I’m curious to hear your thoughts on which of these companies might have what it takes to rise to the top and why. Some examples I’m considering are PLTR, SHOP, CRWD, APP, RKLB, and a few others. I wasn’t around during the early days of Amazon, Apple, and similar companies, but I imagine they also went through cycles of intense enthusiasm, stock price spikes, and corrections. Could we be seeing something similar play out with these names?",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hblmf3/overvalued_companies_pltr_shop_crwd/,92,2024-12-11 05:37:53,"ABNB, CVNA, CAVA, ELF etc. etc.; $SHOP is my biggest holding as I’m up +1,200% since May 2017 with a cost basis of $8.92. I’ve taken profits over the years and now it’s just continuing to ride. I haven’t followed the stock in a few years, so I don’t have an opinion on value or growth prospects, but I’m largely bullish on digital payments and eCommerce, so I don’t see what could slow this train. 

Curious to hear what others think of Shopify long term.; i’m extremely bullish on CRWD because i work in the industry. fantastic product and is the gold standard for EDR; Buying over valued stocks... what could go wrong? ha; Palantir is the most obvious one to me; What about RDDT ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm); From your list, I like PLTR and RKLB.
Yes, all are technically over valued and need to “grow” into their valuations.

SHOP is solid but quite mature so I don’t see massive future scale. Maybe if they did something really unique like acquire payment processing. Otherwise their TAM is limited. Love the company though.

CRWD I like as a leader and security will also be a big issue. Just getting more and more competitive. I can also imagine other more AI entrants emerge to steal share.

APP this one to me is almost all speculation. The others have more merit to being valued as much. Just my opinion and at these levels.

RKLB if they can truly establish themselves as a solid #2 or #3 in the space sector could be huge. I also live their end-to-end model that isn’t even reliant on launches. I don’t think most are even aware of this. It’s the riskiest one listed but also smallest market cap of the group. Also like Sir Peter Beck. Smart, innovative yet scrappy and efficient.

PLTR is my favorite. Might revert to mean a bit but long term trend is still up. LLM’s get all the hype and chips to support AI. But the value is actually being able to use AI ti extract meaningful insights from complex systems. Whether its defense intelligence, supply chain efficiency, spending efficiency, PLTR has a 10 year head start. FedRamp high is also huge. The market size is huge and growing.

RKLB and PLTR are my two 10 year holds. (Other than VOO and real estate) I mention to show diversification.; Possibly. This is the story with great growth stocks. The hope is that some will do so well the success will more than make up for the stinkers. Growth investing also concedes there will be some that crash big time.; I recently went into APP as well. I find it really interesting how they turn their AI marketing tech to anything mobile. I really hope the recent correction will lead their way up.; Let’s see them move higher I’m ok with making them more overpriced…crwd to 450 PLTR to 125 next year let’s go; COST, TSLA; CVNA?; is RCAT overvalued?; $wing; Of all of these, AppLovin is the only one which has a chance.  
Rapidly growing earnings, low scaling costs, good margins so strong moat.  
But I'd rather invest in companies which have these characteristics and aren't so expensive.  
That's why I'm betting big on YMM and a smaller amount on BKNG and TCOM.  
(I should've bet big on APP a few months ago but foolishly, I focused on Plus500's lower scaling costs and lower valuation and didn't take into account earnings growth. Won't make that mistake again.); $TSLA has to be on this list. The PE is now what? 160x?;  TSLA?; ServiceNow; this means its a buy; try MSTR, lol; Palantir isnt actually young, but it’s gotten traction in commercial business recently (other momentum is coming from index inclusion and supposed political tailwinds); Surprised Hood isn’t being talked about here; FICO; PLTR for sure, I was not able to justify when the stock was $12 and can’t justify now, but time will tell.; Personal experience... I bought CRWD when it tanked after the Microsoft/airline scandal and then sold it all when it hit $320. I'm sorta pissed that I missed some of these recent gains (and will hafta pay capital gains on my meager profits) but I'm also convinced it will fall back to $220 again pretty soon. Thing is, you're right. All the firms you cited are solid companies that are simply overvalued at the moment. Every last one of them will be on sale in the next six months. Have patience and keep some dry powder ready.

\*I also ALMOST bought APP when it was under a $100 and just never pulled the trigger, for instance. Sucks. I do think it will become buyable again in the near future but even this recent pullback doesn't quite tempt me. Again, patience is what I'm stressing.; SHOP must have more blood.; Just dumped cvna and trimmed abnb; ABNB has too much regulatory constraints (ie cannot rent for more than N% of the year), plus with housing crises and rent affordability only increasing this top-down/bottom-up pressure squeezes any long term value.

(I formally held a position in ABNB but sold.); Been trying to figure out why CAVA is nearly three times the value of chipotle; I've been holding it for 3 years now, sold off a little when it spiked recently. I've used Shopify for 5+ years and there's nothing even close to being as competitive imo for medium to larger companies for a turn key ecomm platform. There's competition for smaller companies but overall unless one of them can really make huge strides I would have a hard time believing can catch up to them anytime soon.; Congrats! Been loading up on SHOP the past 6 months. Wish I discovered it earlier.; This doesn’t address the valuatuon though.; I’m in cybersecurity as well. Caution is just because a product is good doesn’t mean a company isn’t overvalued.; You don’t care about valuations coz you are a buy and hold I’m assuming?; What do you do in the industry? Never seen someone who works in the industry say this; Of this list, I’d say go in on PLTR. With President Thiel & company coming to power, it will only moon. The rest may crumble if there’s a recession but President Thiel will save his ass with some juicy defense contracts. 

Personally, I’m a boring VOO guy tho but feel like PLTR is the play if you’re stock picking.; I don't take anyone serious who's clearly married to PLTR. Everyone knows it's over valued except the weird culty stock holders; App? They had insane blowout earnings last call.; You don't mind the obscene valuation? Arguably biggest bubble valuation in the entire market right now; was wondering if anyone would say COST. I bought two shares in 2021 and they have literally doubled in value. by far my best performing stock but for some reason I am afraid to buy more.; Way too many bears have died on that trade and have PTSD from seeing those four letters; According to Yahoo finances, 25377 pe, easy peezy; !remindme 180d; I thought we were discussing serious companies, not meme stocks.; Just bought SMCI and CVNA puts “just in case”; CAVA is worth less than 6x of what CMG is...what are you on about?; Oops, that's not how stocks work 🫣; dont search the news articles - they always spin the stock to match the trend and price. 

example, in 2021 when nio was 40 goldman sachs released an article saying how nio is the future and could easily scale with a price target of 60. 

now, goldman sachs lowered their price target to 3.90 sighting ""profitiability concerns and fierce competition"" . 

Despite nio sales literlaly 5x'ing since 2021 and  margins slowly getting better. profitability and compeition was always a concern, Id argue even bigger back in 2021. 

if CAVA crashes 95% they will release articles about how the busines model is dead etc.; lol what?  I think you missed a turn. WSB is on the left.; This is finance 101, we are looking for value, a good company adds to value but it isn't everything,  PLTR had GREAT value at $6, but $60 all good news is priced in.

They offer a great product for the public sector, but not at this price.  I'll keep my eyes pealed for a pullback on CWD. Not in cyber security, but I'll think about buying the dips; ""it's not what you buy, it's what you pay""; Buy good companies and you will be fine. Valuations will sort themselves out over time.; Agreed, sounds like the take of a tier one IT help desk, not a security professional.; this might have been just what I needed to sell my PLTR shares; Not married to it, but if it dips 20% or so, I’d consider engagement; I respect anyones view that’s making healthy consistent returns.; The tailwinds with the Trump administration and very promising. Time will tell.; Never underestimate culty holders; Totally get it. Candidly, it didn’t pass my radar until it was much too late and I’ll admit I don’t know it well enough. Just felt mobile marketing wasn’t “big” enough opportunity and missed the run so didn’t dig in.

What I do like looking now is it really seems like their estimated earnings is too low based in trends so likely another blow out quarter. Just not sure what true expectations are.; What does it matter if you’re holding for 10+ years? Realistically if you’re not a short term trader this doesn’t matter. DCA into these companies and hopefully reap the benefits in 10+ years once the meet their valuations and more; Like someone else said, this is specifically my speculative, long term holding. I have a thesis and of course could be wrong but I accept the risk.

Valuation is tough on a company that is fairly recently profitable. PE is a better tool for more mature companies with earnings history. For instance, people point out CVNA. But that is a horrible use of PE as they just turned back to profitable earnings so it's a tiny amount.

With PLTR the thing I love the most is rule of 68 which is pretty much unheard of and warrants a premium. They are seeing major revenue growth but also increasing margins so earnings expansion! So I do believe they grow into a more reasonable valuation over the coming years. Maybe stock triples while earnings quintuples type scenario.

Another example is NVDA about a year ago their forward PE was in the 60's. But the earnings that actually came in were quite a bit higher and would have actually been closer to 27. So that 60 was highly inflated because expectations were too low.

It's also a great stock to do a wheel strategy with.

And no, it hasn't priced in 30 years of growth. lol.

I am by no means telling anyone to buy PLTR. Super risky. It's my attempt to find a smallish company that will be the next MSFT, META, GOOG, NVDA 10 years early. NO ONE knows what will be that next NVDA. I have enough of that exposure with my index fund holding.; I’m really curious now how it’s gonna fair now that Amazon has entered its moat. Will bears finally have their fill?; Lmfao wow, is that the highest PE for a company ever? How is it maintaining this price level?; !Remindme 60d; I will be messaging you in 5 months on [**2025-06-09 09:20:18 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2025-06-09%2009:20:18%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hblmf3/overvalued_companies_pltr_shop_crwd/m1i0ta4/?context=3)

|-|-|-|-|; CVNA puts are so expensive, what did you get? I was looking at the Jan27 $150p, but couldn't pull the trigger, gonna wait a little.; Growth potential in USA and Europe already factored in.  I believe they already stated they are opening a whole bunch of stores all over the place.; My b, I was just talking about the stock price. Not company valuation; We use it at my organization as well. I am in information security but not in the area that uses the tool. I have had my eye on the stock but have not pulled the trigger yet.; fair. I mean I’m not holding it either as I said in my comment. Just have FOMO from what’s going on.; ill buy them; Just buy it now and hold. If it dips 20% buy more. Getting hung up on a valuation for a 20 year screaming buy is where almost everyone goes wrong. Nobody that bought apple 20 years ago cares if it was at a peak day or discount day. Same for meta. Volatile first year of trading and doesn’t matter—everyone who bought and held is filthy fucking rich. There are so few of these companies that come along, maybe 5 every 20 years. NVDA, PLTR,MSTR buy all day long at any and every price these markets are giving you. 

Zoom out. Think long term.; Lol as someone formally deeply entrenched in Apedom, trust me,  I know ahaha; This is a great point and I'm taking the advice, I'm putting auto buys on PLTR to DCA, but I'm also going to finish taking some profit at these valuations.

That should satisfy both my cold feet and appetite; How about the fact that it would take 10+ years to grow into the valuation your paying TODAY.; That it has already priced in 30 years of 30+% growth doesn't matter? Lmao; Trying to forecast 10 years...haha; I disagree with almost everything you wrote here. Good luck; It's better than a negative PE 🤣 which plenty of companies have.; ABNB gets hated on Reddit, but I think it's a solid buy around $100; And what are you talking about? The person i replied to said CAVA is worth more than Chipotle. That is definitely not true.; Why does the stock price matter?; Think long term, sure, but 400% in 6 months?; Good idea. I can’t say whether it’s a good buy or not just the fact that people spouting valuations like it’s the gospel are usually thinking in the short term for a company like this.; Yea if absolutely nothing changes over the next 10 years. When is the last time the economy and the rate at which a company expands and grows stays the same/consistent for 10 years??? Never. Like I said. DCA into it and it doesn’t matter. Pick up a bunch when it inevitably dumps to $30 then stop crying; lol I can guarantee that people said the exact same thing about every company in Mag 7 and people like you would’ve said it was ridiculous to invest in them at certain points. Things change with time. Growth may increase way more than 30%. Time will tell.; Businesses like this can grow at 100% per year over and over in this phase; What, you don’t invest long term? It’s nothing new to invest in a company for 10+ years. I’m talking about investing not trading.; No worries. Everyone has their own opinion. I was simply sharing mine and of course you are free to provide your helpful insights to OP’s question as well.; To me, stock price is what the market values the company at. But I’m still trying to understand how CAVA ($127) is worth 6x less than CMG ($65). Can someone take this as a teaching opportunity instead of just downvoting?; So you’re saying you agree this thing is massively overpriced and dca when it takes a dump down to 30ish a share? Then i agree.; Except they are growing mid to high 20s…; You might be getting downvoted (not by me though) bc stock price doesn’t really matter, just market cap, PE ratio, etc. lots of great YouTube videos and blog posts out there after a quick search. Happy learning!; Cmg had a split recently. It was well over 1K a share. Share price doesn’t matter when it comes to value. Look at NVDA also.  Multiple splits.; A company’s market capitalization is share price * shares outstanding.  If I have one share outstanding and a share price of $1000, my market cap is $1000.  If I have 1M shares outstanding and a $1 share price, my market cap is $1M.

So the $1 priced company is worth wayyyyy more than the $1000 priced company in my example above. 

Market cap is a good proxy for the company’s valuation (what the market thinks the company is worth), albeit “enterprise value” is a better metric for this (market cap + debt - cash).  

Does that make sense?; I never said it wasn’t overpriced lol my original comment literally said just DCA into it. I know it’s overpriced but I’m still putting $100 a week into it in case the market stays irrational for the next 2 years and it keeps trucking forwards. And I’ll continue putting $100 weekly if/when it dumps to $30 and then I’ll be laughing in 10 years when it’s worth $200 a share.; in a down cycle economy with extremely high interest rates; Yes it does, thank you for taking the time out to explain that to me; 200$ a share ? Lmao. To be worth that it would have to grow like double the rate it’s growing now, for the entire 10 years.; Dude we can sit here and argue all day about what it’s gonna be in 10 years. Both of us have no idea so I don’t know why you’re laughing lol it’s already closing in on $100 and you think in 10 years there’s no possibility of that doubling? Get off your high horse. You probably sat with your thumb up your ass all the way from $20 saying it was overpriced and you’ll sit on your ass for the next 10 years. I could lose my money or you’ll be regretting not taking the risk. One of us will be right.; Refer to my most recent comment about us having no idea. Market can stay irrational for way longer than either of us can predict. So I’m not going to sit here and pretend I know what it’s going to be. Could be $30 or it could be $200. I literally have no idea. But in 20 years I’m hoping I’ll be able to look back and thank myself for not listening to short term “investors” scared of their own shadow; Stfu dude, tell me what reason does pltr have to suddenly, in 1 year, bring up 300% when nothing at the company has fundamentally changed.? They have barely been hitting their projections, barely making money, growing modestly, by far not hyper growth. Stock price Completely disconnected from the fundamentals. Let me tell you why ? AI hype. I like the company and think long term they will be fine. But only really investable if there’s a major correction."

[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse); Pretty confident in WMT, it’s so ingrained in Americans lives. Something I’ve noticed with WMT is that they are essentially playing both games, up scale and economy retailer. The rich get their goods delivered and the working class shop in store. They have some things they need to work on, but they have been making strides.; Shop is massive; Hard to compare any of the new companies to Apple, Google, or Meta.

Apple was grinding for a long time, but the iPhone is what made them a juggernaut. If someone else had come up with the iPhone, Apple would likely be much more like Dell today.

  
Google was making money like crazy and its stock trended upward pretty much immediately.

  
Facebook bounced around a little early on, but they are somewhere in between Apple and Google. They were making good money, but required a good deal of innovation along the way to be what they are, as Facebook proper likely has declining revenue. Without Instagram, and all the other bets they are making (like AI), their stock would likely be much smaller.; Aerotyne, a cutting edge high tech company out of the Midwest. About to get patent approved with huge military and civilian application. You will thank me later.; You need to start with a vision for the future. Below are my beliefs - you will probably disagree with some of these, but everyone needs to have their own point of view so they don't chicken out and sell amidst market volatility. I don't need all my predictions to play out either; if half of these 10x in the next 10 years, I will be outperforming the market.

Cybersecurity - CRWD and S

Cryptocurrencies - HOOD and COIN

Space exploration - RKLB

Quantum Computing - MSFT & GOOG; doubtful one of the small companies will win against these giants

Industrial internet of things - IOT

Autonomous cars - TSLA; I'm not kidding

Flying cars - ACHR and JOBY

Gig economy: UPWK

Reddit: RDDT - I don't even know how to label this thing; yes we're in 1999 again; $HOOD seems to be quite a disruptor imo. I would not be surprised if it 5x in the next 10 years.; [deleted]; Rddt and hood; Pltr 🚂; $HOOD will end up being a monster; RKLB is 20% undervalued according to Simply Wall Street’s DCF model.

And honestly…. It’s early innings

I think it is undervalued. Maybe not from a classic value perspective. But, what the market will eventually price it as.

There’s youtube vids on PLTR that have 126K views

There’s 11K post tagged on it on instagram

On RKLB

Youtube videos with RKLB max out at like 14K views and that’s not the majority of them.

And on instagram the RKLB tag has only been used like 1000 times.

And not even all of those are even about rocket lab the company .

We are in the early innings I feel.

Plus, 🚀 means to the moon and this company is called rocket lab.

I see it catching fire.

Their profits are just way too low to justify the current valuations.; Also a long time holder of PLTR, always said one day they will be as big as Lockhead Martin that said, wow that was fast. I took out my initial investment and kept 100 shares in the game. 1 trillion dollars in valuation, that sounds crazy and it is, however they have started partnering with existing big players and may become the go to for AI in defense, especially with Aundril which I thought wouldn’t want anything to do with them on board tells me something. So I will not be selling even if it is over valued in my mind, also keep in mind the commercial aspect, they saved airbus 33%, that’s the power of AI.; I build analytic models.

The only thing wothwile in their demo was their notion of ontology which is something any company that replicate. Standardization of features and construction of features is nothing new. See H2O platform. 

What do they actually solve? 95% if time biz doesn’t even know what they even are asking for or need. If their “tool” is good for discovery analytics, and it gains traction in small to medium sized companies that have the infrastructure to do it in-house, I’d explain Azure ml or aws sagemaker or anyone of these ML for dummies platforms to replicate their approach. 

They’re not selling we’re analytics platform. Tableau is one. They’re selling we’re an AI shop. If anyone actually knew by AI they mean building a quick classifier for anomaly detection off of sklearn then I need a more in depth explanation as to why they’re blowing up other than a bunch of naive people thinking something else entirely.

I simply believe that when they said that be-spoke solutions are better, from my experience, I can say that the benefits are there, the cost is also there. I have tried and failed and seen other programs at my company try and fail to make a one stop shop, that ends in disaster, absolute disaster because one engineer got to greedy, it taints the product and becomes useless, I plead with people to make a ecosystem that is fully modular. I think Palantir made an ecosystem, that’s why I believe in them.; I see, not a bad idea, if it is back up to 80 range then you can already make $1000 out of these 20 calls; It's really a gamble. If they aren't included then I expect a 30% drop easily. Fundamentally this company is worth $25-30 a share at best, no reason to be siting in the 60-70 range. The play might be lotto calls for next week and maybe 2 puts for the week after in case of the gap down. Either way you either win a shit load or break even with the puts"

Neat. 🤷‍♂️; Is that confirmed?; Allegedly; I wish it is confirmed, but it is not.. the results will be out on Friday; Does this mean MSTR go up or down and QQQ go up or down?; No chance Palantir doesn't even move on this news...this must mean it's still not confirmed; Ohh AXON getting added too.

They should be dropped entirely!; Puts just like all the SMCI back when it was 1300; Fuckin LOL; Haha so many butthurt buttcoiners here.  You guys been scrapping your shitty gains and getting rekt in options when you realise you could have just invested in bitcoin a decade ago?

I would love to see genuine statistics on how many of you sad fuckers actually just missed the boat and are now letting your bitterness drive your view in bitcoin.; So everyone will be forced to buy their shitty worthless shares in their 401k. Nice! Love the manipulation.; 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀; Oh hell no; 🤢🤮; Big event. Big catalysts often spark the beginnings or ends of a bull or bear market. Buy low, sell high. Buy the rumours, sell the news. When it's known the the public, that's when huge liquidity comes in from retail buying with market orders. The pros love to get retail lining up to buy their stocks which they have held since discovering cheap stock in the early stages of a bear market recovery, floating out news and setting sell limit orders. If sensational news comes out, you know the hedge funds are selling into the eager hands of retail.; No it won’t.; SELL THE NEWS; This will be SMCI 2.0 and I am here for it; Lol; Isn’t it buy the rumor, sell the news?; In case MSTR actually gets added to the index, it would likely be bearish for the ETFs in the long run (a bad omen), since it is just degenerate nonsense. The index (its maintainers, to be precise) would instantly become way more clownish than it already is, and lose confidence of some of the more sophisticated investors.

MSTR is not a business worthy of adding to the index. They don't produce any signature goods or services. It's just a greater fool scheme. If it was suddenly erased from existence by divine intervention, it would not affect the real economy or the citizens in any significant way (not that PLTR is super essential).; Going to sell QQQ if this dogshit actually gets in ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|31226); The janky dashboards let them in.

to paraphrase, if corn fell substantially, the multiple on NAV would probably shrink to \~1, or could even trade at a discount to the corn holdings if insolvency became a risk.

it trades at 2.53 mNAV per diluted share currently, at 377.32 / sh, so a 1x multiple would be \~149 / sh at current btc price, then drop that figure by whatever haircut you want to give to corn.

80% drop in corn would be \~$30 / share, unless I'm mistaken on the mNAV math.; Probably similar percent to its recent rise vs bitcoin; It would unwind spectacularly, Saylors MSTR would drop like it did in 2000 for different reasons but still, the man will have managed to pop that shit again.; Oh man was I happy to sell at 50% profit last week; Planitar pleas fly again 🚀; No. This is just the speculation.; 100% confirmed from Bloomberg.; It's 100% confirmed from Bloomberg.; MH or after close?; Yes; definitely to the right; PLTR joining Nasdaq was confirmed weeks ago and it jumped 10%. Was posted on Reddit my guy; Don't you think it'll be too late to buy after they make it official?; That’s what caught my eye the most!; I believe S&P 500 screens companies but Nasdaq operates mechanically; sorry you missed the ride bro but now you and the rest of the working class can buy it at the top through forced buys in your 401k and IRA; That's not bad, Michael Saylor wants you to YOLO puts :); Bagholder spotted.

I bought 3.5k worth of calls 3 months ago before the jump and I am up substantially,  but will continue building the position even though the sentiment on this subreddit is very negative due to the P/E ratio; Yep; I don’t get it, either the boat has been missed or bitcoin is going to continue to outperform equities. If it’s the former then it’s time to sell and go elsewhere, if it’s the latter then mocking potential hodlers is weird.; Can you imagine selling a winner for 1 company you disagree with taking up less than 0.5% of the total weight?! Lol; They’re not a financial company they’ve been a software company for over 2 decades. They just have there free cash flow in bitcoin as the dollar loses monetary value due to inflation while bitcoin won’t. Because btc has shot up so have they but they are a software company; You should go all in on it.; the convertible bonds have printed for holders.; 80% drop on corn isn’t going to happen bruh lol.

It isn't doing jack shit. That means it's not confirmed.; link？; Expected and likely are not confirmed; AH; Haha I knew that would be the response; Lol dude

Moving their listing onto nasdaq and being included into the nasdaq 100 are totally different things

They moved their listing from NYSE to nasdaq a couple of weeks back

 The Nasdaq will announce which companies are going to get added to the Nasdaq 100 on the 13th...google the news...there is no confirmation of Palantir getting added as of this moment; Google it...there is no news/confirmation that Palantir has been added to the Nasdaq 100...companies that get added are announced on the 13th of December

It this is 100% confirmed, I highly doubt Bloomberg terminal is the only source with this news and it hasn't already spread to other news outlets by now; What amazing timing! Are you still holding the calls? Also do you think this Nasdaq push will allow it into retrace to its monthly highs just below 700?; Did the math, if MSTR drops or goes up 10%, it is a mere  .046% change on QQQ, that is basically nothing lol.; I get it, no one invests for their software business though. The software business has shrinking revenues and loses two dollars for every dollar they bring in, after 20 years in business.

The valuation that's 200x their revenue, and stock price, are not based on their software business.

But people do invest and place value in their financial offerings and the promise of ""bitcoin yield"". That sounds like a financial product from a financial company. And that seems to be their primary offering.

I don't care either way. But let's not take their word for it. 

If I sell meth off of a farm, that doesn't make me a farmer.; Correct; I love microstrategy but this is a pretty big stretch. If something like 90% of your growth is fueled by bitcoin (or from your perspective, the lack of shrinkage due to fiat inflation), the 10% of growth fueled by software does not make you a software company, even if that’s what you were previously.

If airbnb starts buying oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico and 10xes, they aren’t a tech company anymore, they’re a petroleum company; Maybe not right now. But many people are rich for having gone all in on MSTR in the past year; It really is the infinite money glitch 😂 ; it was the % drop scenario discussed in the interview I linked.; Pics of dicks; 100% confirmed to be expected; Rumors are better than news; ... then can't wait until they are delisted...; Arigato calls for next week safer?; Yes; Yes the point is everyone knew why they moved to the Nasdaq so they can be included in the 100 again read the post; Still holding, I think the price is currently consolidating at around 640, so If there aren't any substantial market shifts, it will likely start going up again. These are my thoughts, and I could be very wrong :D; Thank you for doing the math! It proves a very good point that this guy is handicapping himself for no reason.; Not many farms on QQQ.

They are a software operating business, with the best balance sheet in the world.; Ah yes. The infinite money glitch - the inevitable precursor to an almighty GUH; For sure , just saying if it goes down 80%, you’ll see SPY 300 again. Not very likely.; Gozaimasu calls for next month ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276); Lol...you are regarded

What the fuck do you mean ""so they can be included again""?

They have never been in the Nasdaq 100...getting into the nasdaq 100 is a totally different thing from moving their listing to Nasdaq...moving your listing to Nasdaq doesn't automatically grant admission into Nasdaq 100

And FYI, no one was talking about admission into Nasdaq 100 when they moved from NYSE...the price spike was simply because they moved their listing; https://preview.redd.it/p30py706iq6e1.jpeg?width=725&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=568abb52a99172889f2a81ac9ac1d7ca1f9f887a; btc price has nothing to do with spy price; Again….Read the post!

BTC will probably catch Apple this time next year. MSTR will probably catch em in the 15-20. Should be fun to watch!; Yes, it does. It’s a first mover and has been since around 2016. If crypto crashes so does spy. Look back at previous data.; Apple could buy double MSTR's bitcoin stash tomorrow using only cash on hand, and still only use half of what they have available.

Apple instead has spent $100B buying their own stock.

MSTR pays off old debt with new debt and rotates through the bills before they become due. They do not have a great source of revenue or profit as of yet. Hopefully they're developing something.

MSTR has a great advantage of being the first to take that strategy, but the reality is that they aren't doing anything unique, and would be at a disadvantage to anyone else who has enough cash to match or a better reputation. 

It's going to be fun for a while, but if you think MSTR is going to overtake Apple, it's going to take more than stashing BTC in the basement and market volatility as a primary product. They're going to need income.; the typical btc cycle does not correlate with spy price. sure if a big economic event happens then liquidity gets sucked out of all markets, not just btc and stocks. 
by ur statement, ur saying spy also has a 4 year cycle which is not true; Yup. Apple has had a shit load of cash and could have bought a lot of bitcoin over the years...and still could. But they dont need to. So they most likely wont. Like MSFT.

They have already inegrated BTC into apple pay and will probably have a native wallet sometime soon. That will be used onboard a lot of users as btc becomes more ubiquitous. 

The crazy thing is that as big as BTC seems, its actually very tiny compared to scale of global assets. It could do a 20x and still be an 1/8th the size of global bond market. It probably  will over time.

MSTR is and will be the largest corporate holder of BTC, so they will be a good position to make use of their capital. Next year they will be able actually mark their gains on their balance sheet. So Q1 2025 they have some ""earnings"" to post.; That is incorrect. Drastic moves in crypto are followed by drastic moves in equity. There's plenty of research out there confirming this to be true.

https://www.bitcoinmagazinepro.com/blog/understanding-bitcoin-correlation-to-stock-market-its-impact/#:\~:text=Bitcoin%20follows%20general%20market%20trends,a%20Bitcoin%20stock%20market%20decoupling.

I say this as someone who has been purchasing BTC since 2014.

Makes sense you attend SDSU, tbh.; oh my god ur fucking ignorant. crypto does not lead the other asset classes u idiot🤣🤣the reason for them both going up is cuz we’ve been in a bull market because of all the inflation. youve “been in crypto since 2014” and never heard of a bull market? ur little source confirms what im saying. maybe u shouldve went to school so u can comprehend what im saying. im literally arguing with a wall rn"

I want to do options but I thought I read on here it was going to split; Didn't the feds urge users not to use regular messaging apps because China hacked into it? I can imagine people opting to use Apple if they're using satellites as their messaging platform.; Reverse split is gonna fuck the options.; Different offerings at least for now. It would make sense since the amount of throughput for basic comms and text is so low. ASTS is targeting broadband level data and 5G network capabilities. Remains to be seen how testing goes for ASTS or if GSAT has updated sats to also compete in that space too.

Unity Technologies ,"https://preview.redd.it/hbzkp23fz26e1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=698c4992c16ee91fc7afc47c3a28e81add772ebc

Unity Software Inc. (doing business as **Unity Technologies**) is a technology company that specializes in developing and operating a platform for creating real-time 3D content and experiences. Unity is primarily known for its game engine and development tools, which allow creators to build, run, and monetize interactive 2D and 3D content across various platforms.

Their engine and development tools is used in wide range of industries including Video game development , architecture and design , automotive , film and animation , and virtual and augmented reality.

They are a duopoly in the game engine market with Epic Games (Unreal Engine). Unity holds approximately 40-50% of the game engine market share, while Unreal Engine accounts for 10-20%. As of 2023, over 70% of the top mobile games globally were developed using Unity's platform. In 2024, mobile gaming is expected to generate approximately $92.6 billion in revenue compared to $51.9 billion for console gaming and $40 billion for PC gaming. As of 2024, a significant portion of VR apps in the Apple Store are likely created using Unity, with estimates suggesting that over 60% of AR/VR content across platforms is made with Unity.

Unity's stock have been doing poorly ever since the great 2022 bear market , the John Riccitiello fee incident (2022) , and the dreadful IronSource purchase (2022) under his tenure. They have since fired him in 2023 and appointed Matthew Bromberg as Unity's new Chief Executive Officer, President, and a member of the Unity Board of Directors, effective May 15, 2024. Bromberg has since replaced all the C-suites with competent people. They did a reset on their portfolio to put their focus on their core business which they refer to as their ""Strategic Portfolio"": the Engine, Cloud and Monetization.

The Strategic Portfolio consists of two main segments:

* Create Solutions: This segment encompasses Unity's game development platform and tools. In Q3 2024, Create Solutions revenue grew 5% year-over-year, driven by subscription growth. The Create segment includes:

1. Unity game engine and development tools
2. Unity 6, the latest version of the engine with over 500,000 downloads
3. Expansion into non-gaming industries (Industry segment), which grew **59% year-over-year and represents 18% of Create revenue**

* Grow Solutions: This segment includes advertising and monetization tools. In Q3 2024, Grow Solutions revenue declined by 5%. It focuses on:

1. Advertising technology
2. Monetization services for game developers
3. Development of a new advertising model set to launch in 2025

Let's talk about the mobile gaming monetization and advertising space and their competitor AppLovin (the stock that is up 768% YTD) . AppLovin wanted to buy Unity for $20B back in 2022 to form a monopoly but got rejected. Unity has since failed to keep up with AppLovin who is now the third largest mobile gaming in-app advertising network after Google and Meta. Unity-ironSource platform just can't compete with AppLovin's superior algos and platform but things are about to change because the new CEO hired Jim Payne to join the company as Chief Product Officer for Advertising effective August 12, 2024. Payne co-founded MoPub, the world’s largest mobile in-app ad server and exchange, and MAX Advertising Systems, a mobile header bidding platform (both acquired by AppLovin). In their latest earning's call Bromberg said they have a new machine learning model in their new neural network that is being tested on their live data that will be ready to launch when it's ready (probably sometime next year). APP's current mcap is $111B while Unity is at $10.78B , if their new ML model is competitive , the stock can easily **5x from here just from the Grow Solutions business**. This is why some people are looking to short AppLovin and long Unity.

On the Create Solution side Unity recently announced on Oct 30, 2024 they hired Ex-King CTO and Havok Co-Founder Steve Collins as CTO which will add key technical leadership to accelerate product innovation, quality, and stability.  In 2023, Havok products were used in twelve of the top twenty best selling video games in the United States. Here are a [list of games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Video_games_using_Havok) you probably heard of that used Havok physics:

\- Dark Souls 1-3

\- Bloodborne

\- BioShock series

\- CS:GO

\- Half-Life 2

\- The Last of Us

\- Halo 2 & 3

\- The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild & The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom

Now let's talk about war , Unity's engine and development tools is also used by the DoD

The Department of Defense (DoD) primarily uses the Unity engine to create realistic, immersive virtual training simulations for military personnel, allowing them to practice complex scenarios in a safe and controlled environment across various domains like combat tactics, vehicle operation, war simulations and situational awareness, all within a 3D digital world.

Unity Technologies Corporation (UnityTec) has been awarded two significant contracts related to the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD):

* [JETS 2.0 Contract](https://govtribe.com/opportunity/federal-contract-opportunity/dla-j6-enterprise-technology-services-jets-2-dot-0-sp470923r0001-45) : UnityTec secured a position on the Defense Logistics Agency's J6 Enterprise Technologies Services 2.0 (JETS 2.0) multiple-award, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract. This contract has a maximum value of $12 billion and will provide a broad range of IT-related services to the entire DoD for up to 12 years.
* CACI Contract: Unity signed a ""multi-million dollar"" contract with enterprise technology firm CACI to become the ""preferred real-time 3D platform"" for U.S. government defense projects.

I don't think even the Palantards know this , [Palantir's Mixed Reality](https://www.palantir.com/offerings/mixed-reality/) offering is built with Unity's 3D engine.

[The future of warfare is powered by Unity's 3D engine.](https://preview.redd.it/zw7w2aj2z26e1.png?width=2379&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4f900c7489db3c6841321cb494c66a8c0035add)

Now let's rewind it back to 2015 when [Mark Zuckerberg sent a four page internal email](https://sriramk.com/memos/zuck-unity.pdf) to key executives to get in early on the AR and VR future. In that email , Mark Zuckerberg wanted to purchase Unity because he believes AR/VR is the major computing platform after mobile and they will gain control over a key development platform for AR/VR content. He believes the acquisition of Unity would also mitigate the risk of a competitors like Google and Apple from acquiring them and limiting Meta (Facebook then) access to the platform. One of the possible reasons the acquisition fell through is antitrust concerns because Meta would be a monopoly in VR/AR if they own Unity.

I believe the future is XR (extended reality) and that XR will be next major computing platform after mobile. I believe Meta will become the largest company in the world within the next 10-20 years, which is why I’m highly optimistic about Unity, given its significant role in the XR ecosystem. This is a long term investment for generational wealth.

This post is made for posterity.

**Ticker:** U

**Direction:** Up

**Prognosis:** Long-term buy, potential 5x return.

**Reasoning:** Unity, a dominant game engine with a large share of the AR/VR market, is undergoing a turnaround under new leadership.  Improved monetization strategies and key hires (including a former AppLovin exec) suggest significant growth potential in their ""Grow Solutions"" segment.  Furthermore,  substantial DoD contracts and use in high-profile games like *Dark Souls* add to the bullish case.  This is a long-term play for generational wealth, predicated on the belief that XR will become the next major computing platform.

**Extra:** Even Palantir uses Unity's engine, and Zuck tried to buy them in 2015!


**Author's Position:** 2800 shares, long calls and short puts.; CS:GO is now CS:2 and doesn't use Havok, it uses Rubikon

All games in your list are many years old, that argument is so stupid it only hurts your thesis.; So, you're betting on a turnaround which may or may not work out while the stock is already up 30% in the past month because of changes in leadership.

Seems like a risky bet at this level unless we some evidence of them successfully getting their shit together.; I'm holding 500 shares, but only because I got in at $100.

Seemed like a great play back when it went up to 200.; Beat Saber, Cult of Lamb, Untitled Goose game. There are colleges in the heart of Manhattan that offer Unity Training for graduate level classes.  Look at ARTI 605 at NYIT. 

  
I am a fan of the stock personally. I do own some shares, but not many as I am a small time retail degenerate.; You say meta will become the largest company in the world yet you are arguing for unity? Seems fishy, just get meta then.

Unity broke trust with developers, their main customer base, when they announced a per copy fee unilaterally to be forced upon everyone.

Reason some studios still use it is because a game is usually 3-5 year project so if far enough along it's cheaper to run with your current tools vs switching.

But new projects, they are not going to unity, because no way will a company making games will take a risk on an engine that one day decides each copy sold will have royalties paid to the engine company if they ever decide to put this policy back in.; As a developer I think Un-Real will continue to take space, however unity is so cheap and gets the job so done and lets creators have more controls, toss up a real toss up, both have eco systems but with the games coming out of un-real looking amazing, I mean what am I supposed to say theirs not a wrong answer.; Thank you for the dip. Opened a starter today.; Imo ,I wouldn't invest in unity cus I think unity engine sucks ass 

But so do Tesla cars and Tesla is doing well.; Iam holding 320 shares of this! Lets goooo; [I mean it's kind of crazy the 12 Month Google Search trends. Unity hasn't exactly died....](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fg%2F11qpzy882z,%2Fm%2F0dmyvh,Godot&hl=en)

Unless you're Greenland.; Last time I touched this it went to shit.; Perfect timing bud.; Fuck Unity.; Yeah, no matters how promising unity sound i can't see dev teams switching to it, they lost lots of customers on their previous pay plan. In software industry, what is lost is lost.

Every earning is blood bath everytime for some reason it keeps boucing like if unreal 5 was not a thing

Nvm shit already pumped 15%; > Apple Inc. plans to bring satellite connections to its smartwatch in 2025 and is ramping up work on a blood-pressure feature, seeking to entice hikers and health-conscience consumers into upgrading their devices. 

> The satellite capability is slated to come to next year’s Apple Watch Ultra, the company’s top-of-the-line model, according to people familiar with the matter. The technology will let smartwatch users send off-the-grid text messages when they don’t have a cellular or Wi-Fi connection. 

> The other feature, which would monitor whether Apple Watch users have high blood pressure, may arrive as soon as 2025 as well, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work is confidential. But it’s been delayed before, with Apple previously aiming to release the tool last year. 

tbh the healthcare shit is still more bullish tho

> The company first launched a satellite communication feature with the iPhone 14 in 2022. It let users stay in contact with emergency services while off the grid. The capability was expanded last year to allow for contact with roadside assistance providers. Apple then upgraded the feature again this year to let people use it to text anyone via iMessage.

> The Apple Watch Ultra would be the first mainstream smartwatch with satellite abilities. 

> The move also could give consumers less reason to use a standalone satellite communication device, such as Garmin Ltd.’s inReach.

> Apple’s service relies on satellites from Globalstar Inc., which has expanded its partnership with the iPhone maker over the past few years. 

> In November, Apple invested about $1.5 billion in GlobalStar to beef up the infrastructure. Apple took a 20% stake in the company as part of the deal.; if they could take over garmins hold on the camping/backpacking gps market i think it could be massive; $GSAT $GSAT $GSAT; Global star gsat 🚀🚀🚀; GSAT baby; Can someone explain to me the ASTS vs GSAT comparison? I know it's different spectrum but how does performance or capacity compare?; Easy long calls into next year. Free money.; If you bought during the apple announcement 3 years ago you would have just now broke even after; But why; Paywall eh?; Please the Apple Watch sucks ass. My newer model already had a malfunctioning battery from a basic swim workout. Besides catering to hikers and such isn’t going to work when the battery barely lasts long enough to survive a day and Garmin is still superior in every functionality.; already in with 2026 $2 and $3 calls, nice surprise for today, but GSAT will grow a lot more in 2025; But can you sleep with it and it tracks your sleep or do you still have to charge it every damn day? Idk, im too poor for smart watches. ; Why do I need satellite technology in my watch? Genuine question. I tried using Apple Watch 9 for a few months and ended up giving it to my kid. Happy with my mechanical watches :); Oh well. Now the charge will last for a gigantic 10 min lol; If you want something that actually works, get a Garmin ; i got 10000 shares the day they announced the Apple deal.; Litterally had a limit buy order yesterday that never filled...

Shouldn't have been greedy and bought at market price; Text message to apple watch like lmao. Its not 2000 anymore; It's only the beginning buddy, trust me; The ability to text directly to satellite so a mobile network is what helped drive me over to Apple…

I can’t think of a situation where I’d choose my Apple Watch over my phone to text… I can send txt via my AW Ultra 2 and almost never do. Furthermore, the gps mapping software out there for the AW is garbage. I’d use a 3rd party iPhone app every day; They’re gonna need to build one that can go for more than a day or two days if careful, while allowing GPs usage. I charge my Garmin weekly and that includes gps usage; Just bought a whopping 9 shares…; Yessir; Well, commercially GSAT is obviously more useful than ASTS currently. Other than that I don’t believe the two to be comparable at all. ASTS will be providing subscription-style 5G cellular broadband globally via partnerships with MNOs. Due to several factors such as orbital altitude and satellite size/design, it seems GSAT will really only ever be capable of providing text/voice at scale. ASTS demonstrated data speeds of 21mbps so far with an eventual (target) speed of >35mbps and a latency <30ms. GSAT’s gen2 satellites are capable of speeds around 256kbps with a latency of ~15 seconds.

Globalstar is positioned well to make a whole of money for an outstanding service, but comparing it to the proposed services of ASTS and Starlink is apples to oranges.; They’re going after different business segments right now. Most people don’t really think about the XCOM RAN IOT technology GSAT has.  Walmart is testing this tech in two facilities right now and it may prove to be very profitable in coming years. 

GSAT controlling bandwidth is very helpful to their prospects, and allows them to offer bandwidth offloading services in dense radio environments. 

ASTS is currently focusing more on providing broadband directly to handheld devices anywhere. They have awesome technology that will probably outperform their peers speed wise, but I’m still skeptical about their overall overhead for keeping a large fleet of the most technologically advanced satellites ever built in operation. 

GSAT does all their processing on the ground through base stations, meaning lower overhead costs and easier upgrades as technology advances. GSAT will not be able to provide the same level of broadband as ASTS at first, but they should be able to be quite profitable with their current prospects. 

ASTS is very exciting and may make a ton of money, but it’s really difficult to accurately estimate the cost associated with a service we’ve never seen operating at full capacity yet. We don’t even really know how the telecoms intend to price ASTS’ service yet. There are just so many unknowns in my opinion.; gsat cant do 5g; On Apple or GSAT ?; My watch charges in like 30ish min or less i throw it on my stand when i shower or something its all it needs.; I've got a Huawei GT3. Charge it every 10-14 days. Costs like US$150; People like runners, climbers, and other outdoors enthusiasts will be happy to be have the ability to leave their phones behind while going out without the risk of being stranded without communication if anything goes wrong. 

Plenty of people won’t need it at all, but I bet enough want it to make some money.; Me too except 9500 less than you. To me it was a no brainer; So you broke even after 3 years lmao good job; Are you coming to acquire it?; [deleted]; You don't understand satellite technology and how it works in the apple product environment, it's ok you will see where this stock will be in 1 years time; eh at this point its retail vs retail

It's a time to hold and watch it explode; Again, and, you’re not going out backcountry so your phone… which is all I’m saying; Me too.; cant do that either. It takes special tech to do it within fcc regulations. Even starlink is struggling with all the money they have behind them; Whoa there Mr moneybags; It won't be far superior, GSAT is already working with Apple, it has credibility in a B2B partnership and its only up from here. Their end goal is to compete with starlink and be a direct provider of connectivity to devices anywhere in the world; If Apple found a way, leveraging GSAT, this would be huge. Apple as a service just sounds right. ; Sigh. Please do a !remindme in a few years :); I agree but they’re at least 5 years behind. ASTS took ages to even do tests and they’re not even in revenue territory yet. Having apple behind you is amazing though ngl.

Uber vs Everyone,"Alright unless you been living under a rock you heard or seen some videos of self driving vehicles be it waymo or tesla. The future of self driving vehicles is not a question of if at this point but when .
My question to you is this - how do you see uber play out in this changing fat environment. In your view do you see uber benefiting or losing from the rise of AV brought in by smaller and bigger companies.

Here is my take and I’m also not fully clear (I think the CEO needs to come out and clarify clearly their path and their different partnership goals).

Uber clearly wants to be a software company, the biggest aggregator of all mobility needs. They spent like crazy to be number 1 in travel. They spent like crazy during Covid to be the number 1 food delivery service. They spending like crazy on grocery delivery from what I notice and they eye to grow their freight business.

All their investments and actions points towards the aggregator strategy , from offloading their own self driving decision to Aurora to investing in all kinds of different startup from Serv robotics to Aurora (25% ownership) and companies in India, Asia and Latin America.

Can this strategy back fire? It could, however let’s ask , what does Google want? Google up until this point was mainly a software company, yes they produce their own pixel phones but I believe their main competitor is not Uber but Tesla. Google might be expanding their taxi service but is the end goal for them to be a global taxi company? I think not. There is much more profit in expanding the waymo service up until they prove that their software reached maturity. At that point Google will lease that software to any car manufacturer for a price, growing revenue in speeds that they won’t be able to match staying exclusive, hence the Tesla competitor. In the scenario that they lease/sell their software to any car manufacturer, it won’t be the end of the road for Uber because at worst case they can purchase a fleet of cars to continue their operations and supplement their other AV partners.

Now let’s assume waymo stays exclusive and Google interested to be a taxi company, meaning their partnership with Uber will end and they essentially going to compete with Uber. In this case, uber investments in Aurora Innovation might come helpful, they can re-acquire Aurora and their tech for whatever it’s worth and build on top of it. They can use their large cash flow to acquire a smaller AV company that struggles to compete with the big players and build on it. In both scenarios uber has a way out, as long as they don’t lay on their stomach blinded by short term profits (think BlackBerry in early 2000) and make sure to pivot at the right moment (if aggregator role dont workout, time to go shopping for small AV).

This is how I see it, I will be happy for anyone to challenge this view because sometime we all get blinded by our own biases.
",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hawqbu/uber_vs_everyone/,19,2024-12-10 08:46:46,"There was discussion that Uber was trying to buy Expedia earlier this year. 

IMO, the best case scenario for Uber in a time of self-driving cars (and I do think that these cars being ubiquitous is still quite a few years off - people are acting like it's tomorrow) is that Uber becomes the Expedia for self-driving cars.  And that's... *okay.* It's not a great position and it's a somewhat fragile one that requires having to manage relationships but it's something I suppose.

I don't think that Google wants to be a taxi company, but Google would certainly like all the data that comes with this as well as the opportunity to advertise to people potentially during the ride and through the app. Does Google want to manage the fleet? Probably not. Would they like everything else? I would think so. 

I think the missing element is who is servicing and cleaning all of these cars? If that's Uber, I don't know that that's a great business to maintain stations all around and be cleaning/fixing cars. If Uber owns these cars and maintains them, that's...not very compelling. 

Uber trying to become a travel super app by buying Expedia might make it a more compelling broad travel middleman for some potential self-driving car suppliers, but in terms of Waymo, Google has Google travel...which has been talked about as impacting Expedia for years.

Buying Aurora (note: am long AUR) and getting the expertise of the former CTO of Waymo, the former head of autonomy for Tesla and the Head of Perception and Autonomy Architect for Uber wouldn't be a bad idea but feels unlikely. 

I think Uber seeing a material impact from self-driving is still a ways off, but will be some degree of cloud over the stock from this until there's a more compelling vision from Uber about their role in self-driving. Stock continues to sell off and gets to the low 60's/upper 50's Uber will be technically oversold and maybe play it for a bounce but I think the discussion is going to keep coming back to what about self-driving cars.

""(think BlackBerry in early 2000""

Random/unrelated: I thought the Blackberry movie was pretty good.; Ubers model makes it so the driver takes on the expense of the car, insurance, maintenance and fuel. It is probably a better model financially than driverless cars.  ; uber will be fine. Neither google nor tesla will be interested in building their own fleet in the scale of millions of cars. Eventually they just sell their AV cars to drivers. And driver will let their car working on the platform with the most demand. AV is just something divining the cost of riding down and it’s a tailwind for uber and Lyft.; Uber is not going anywhere, at least for the foreseeable future

They have the largest network in the world and they just started improving their profitability. They have a steady revenue growth and they are still growing in terms of customers, number of rides, etc

One of their biggest successes is that the term ""Uber it"" has basically replaced the word ""cab"" or ""taxi""

It all looks great on paper. However, they are competing against the future. And that term means something else to different people. Be it AI, self driving, teleportation or whatever other nonsense people come up with 

And the second thing they are competing with is Elon Musk's popularity. Which is why the stock has gone nowhere all year. And why it randomly drops on news that has nothing to do with their actual business numbers; I don't get why the threat of self driving cars is causing such fear in Uber. Uber can easily purchase self driving vehicles, can't they? It also seems years away. People are not that keen on the idea. Also for delivery, you need someone to walk to your door. Many people who order delivery are handicapped and rely on these services. This is my simplistic view on their future. It's not like self driving cars will make these services cheaper...what is the point?; You tripping Uber bout to go off; What I find interesting is there’s a common theme between a lot of very successful businesses from completely different sectors, a company might start soley as an insurance company (let’s take Berkshire) but the key to growth is [re]investing in things that are not necessarily your core business. Apple has branched into the finance sector, apple pay, wallet, etc. Amazon just sells everything, like the most branched out you can get. 

And then Uber with all these different types of transportation. They’ll probably invest in the same type of tech Google & Waymo are doing anyway. I didn’t dig into it too hard but their financials are solid, I use Uber, I would consider it a consumer staple, and that key fundamental sealed the deal for me. Not a bad price either. ; Problem is all their competitors just copy what they are doing asap. On Black friday i ordered an apple tv for 50% off from staples on uber eats (they delivered it to my workplace within an hour not kidding). I was like shit i gotta buy some uber stock. The week after, door dash also offered similar promotions and there are new aggregators popping up everyday. The space is so crowded.; I don't own Uber, but I don't really get all the doomsayers. Autonomous vehicles have always been part of their long term plan if I'm not mistaken. Wasn't the idea from the start to build up the network with drivers and phase out the drivers as driverless tech becomes available? It sounds to me like they are just about to transition to phase 2 of their plan. I would be pretty surprised if none of the autonomous tech companies want to partner with Uber.; I think they are cooked in the long term.

Your thesis is basically ""big tech companies won't take their market share!"" - Yes they will.

Once consumers find out they can get a ride for cheaper with a Waymo or Tesla taxi, they will. The limiting factor will likely be how quickly Waymo and Tesla can get cars in the area, and once their offering is widely available, it is game over for Uber.

Uber may remain viable in small cities and towns where there is not enough demand to justify autonomous fleet and maintenance facilities, but if that is all Uber holds on to, that is a bad situation for shareholders. Food delivery is going to be stickier, but that business is not nearly as good as robotaxis.; If the ""when"" is 2040, then it is not relevant today to any investment thesis. I remember when self driving was the overwhelming consensus in 2017. The horizon just keeps getting moved out further and further.; It's going to be a long transition to self-driving taxis.

Possible scenario:

Waymo will be spun off. It will be a vertically integrated independent mobility company with a strong brand.

They may use Uber for demand.

However, Uber will be disrupted and needs to innovate by adding self-driving cars to its fleet using partners.

It's hard to predict if Uber will succeed and dominate or will lose to competitors.

It's going to be a long and windy process. It may take 10 years. May end up being a great investment but I'm out because I'm too old for that timeline.; If autonomous vehicles become available this won't be from just one vendor (or if so: then only for a very short while until you get chinese knock-offs come flooding in). This enables other players to quickly join the market. One such group I would expect to branch out would be car rental companies (Hertz, Sixt, et al.) as well as manufacturers themselves (Tesla has stated in the past that they might even stop seeling cars altogether and just use their own production for robotaxi services. While I don't think they will go that extreme route I do expect them to operate a big robotaxi business of their own, eventually.)

What this means with respect to Uber: While a shift to autonomous driving may increase their profit margins per ride I would suspect that the competition landscape will change radically for the worse. they will not be the only ones supplying software.

 Those who supply software *and* hardware will win.; Do I see uber be a sucesfull company still 10 years from now? Absolutely not. I would pay a 5 pe maybe like the legacy auto makers, it will be a business in decline very soon and the market is paying a premium for it. No thanks; I have to pushback on the years off comment. L5 is on the road now and Waymo is pushing 150000 rides a week. Maybe you meant throughout the US. But the tech is deployed now. And is being launched in Miami next year. The biggest roadblock is no longer the tech its regulations.; Your ride will begin after this short advertisement.; Waymo is simply going to partner with uber and sell the drivers internally a subscription via the app some kind of discounted Waymo self-drive software. 

But this is a decade away.; If there's a great return on investment (adjusted for risks) in ""letting your AV car work on platform"", the taxi supply will shoot up, and sooner or later, the ROI will fall to a mediocre value.


Same as what's now happening with classic Uber/ AirBnB economics.; The English speaking world uses Uber a lot, but there are other services in other countries. It think Uber is roughly 1/3 of the global market. 

Much of Europe uses public transportation or still uses taxis.

Bolt is very popular in Africa and Eastern Europe. Likely used more than Uber there, though I didn’t find exact information.

Didi chuxing in china


The USA is something like 50% of Ubers revenue. And Americans are notoriously fast at picking up new technology. So self driving could impact Uber sooner than people think.; Yea. Ubers has 7.8 millions of drivers. In order to have a shot to compete with that Waymo and Tesla needs to create millions of AV. That seems like years away. Not to mention not every state has approved AVs. If Waymo and Tesla dont control 99% of the market that favors Uber. Since that opens the door to individuals to buy the AVs as well to use on Uber cutting out Waymo/Tesla.; Self-driving is not approved in a widespread fashion anywhere in the USA. The only company with approval is Waymo, who require an extremely expensive vehicle for it to operate. 

Tesla is fundamentally fucked with pure vision-based self-drive. Hence why they have no approval anywhere to operate. 

Long story short, this will take a decade and in the meantime Uber can partner with Waymo to get the self-drive software for cheaper.; Correct. 


Waymo is literally expanding exponentially.

There are workers who take waymo more now then they did uber a year ago. 


I think that's taking market share peak definition lol; Except it’s completely possible that a de-facto monopoly can maintain market share and margins even as supply theoretically expands.; > Maybe you meant throughout the US.

Yep. I mean it's years off before it's everywhere.; Waymo is already partnered with Uber for network effects and logistics. They’re in Austin currently; I rode Uber 3-4 times a day for 8 days in London a couple months ago; Uber is banned in much of Europe, LoL. Something to do with ""drivers should be treated as employees"" law. F-ing commies! 


Asian countries all have ""copy-paste"" apps that undercut Uber's pricing.


I'm not touching Uber at 32 PE, when Google and Meta are trading cheaper.; I think we are years away from seeing self driving cars being the standard. Once they are and if waymo takes off, they r going to be just as expensive as uber. At least uber creates flexible jobs. Hindsight is 20/20. Uber was a great alternative to a cab, no I miss how cheap cabs were compared to Uber.; You can only maintain a monopoly if you have a moat. Having a 'software only' moat is almost impossible.; That’s old news. They are not banned in Europe https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/uber-countries; Europe has not banned Uber. In most EU-countries UBER has expanded in recent years.; Nah, that's nonsense but not odd to see it from some American loon in a flyover state. Ignorance is often a choice, as you prove.



In Europe we simply think people who work ought to be workers, and have the required checks and balances that comes with a job. Uber (for example) happily hired *convicted sex offenders* because they didn't bother with background checks, leading to *sexual assault by taxi drivers going through the roof*. And in almost ever case it was Uber/Lyft because they tried to weasel out of customer safety. *Rapists who got fired from real cab companies could drive Uber the next day* because Uber didn't give a fuck.; soooo emotional 🐶 Just to clarify, I'm not holding Uber, nor advocating for it. Like I said, ""not touching Uber, when there's Google at 22 PE"""

Weird name, wonder if it means something different in Swedish. nice financials, good growth, acceptable price

# 4. NVO, Novo Nordisk

Pharma. Good financials, good growth, ok price. All around pretty decent deal

Italy's electric national grid. This one is probably going to not have too much growth but it's a good old solid utility stock. 4.3% div, in EUR.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hauqh3/top_10_nonus_stocks/,19,2024-12-10 06:32:15,"What makes these the top 10? There's no info provided to justify your list. What's your basis?; The top ones that come to my mind are: ASML, Spotify, Nintendo, Samsung, TSM, Sony; Investing in Taiwan certainly has some serious risk; Safran - French aerospace OEM. They have a very successful joint venture with GE to build commercial jet engines.; How can you make this list without constellation software? It's literally one of the best performing stocks anywhere.; These are stocks which may or may not be available to purchase in a US exchange.

1. **Hon Hai Precison Industry** (Foxconn parent co) - importance to electronics manufacturing cannot be overstated
2. **HDFC Bank** (India's largest private sector bank; private here means no government ownership) - after absorbing its parent HDFC, the bank's finances are undergoing a major shift, with all of the old high interest rate deposits being transitioned to low rate while the bank will now compete directly in the home loan sector. Think of it like the Indian equivalent of JPM but you are also paying the India premium to own this. 
3. **Tencent** - China's Disney with a highly diversified overseas income stream and controlling a huge chunk of the Chinese entertainment industry
4. **XFAB** - The company is in the midst of a transition to SiC manufacturing from legacy 150mm wafer production. The stock price has seen a massive beating and has become extremely undervalued compared to its long term potential
5. **Pilbara Minerals** - Australia's most efficient pure play hard rock lithium miner - stock price has taken a beating but the company continues to be profitable in spite of rock bottom lithium prices. The acquisition of Latin Resources will affect the mid term health of the company but it will also significantly increase their supply capacity. The company is also refining lithium in JVs with other companies, so they are moving up the value chain.; ERJ deserves a mention; $IGIC

DSV.CO

DOL.TO; No LVMH? Also don't sleep on Canada, many solid energy companies with dividend growth like Canadian Natural Resources ($CNQ, $CNQ.TO) and Tourmaline Oil Corp ($TOU.TO). Both didn't cut their dividens during Covid 2020; How about the Germany Stocks? Don't they drive the EU economy?; ASML is where its at. They are basically a monopoly at this point. What they do no one else can. And the barriers to entry are massive. Bonus is their valuation isn’t crazy.; Thanks for sharing; MDA Space - space without the hype; Growth & Consistency of financials, good ROICs ROAs margins etc. Reasonably understandable business that makes sense and would be expected to continue to grow from a soft-skill perspective.; Samsung is cheap at the moment.; SPOT is a lil expensive right now. Maybe if it were half the price at least; Theyre starting construction on their Arizona factory next year. That will drastically reduce risk. Plus there really isnt much risk if what youre talking about is China invading, TSMC will just blow up their factory, and China wont invade; Nice pick, adding that to my watchlist. Thanks; Great company and I have some. Too expensive right now; I’m looking into that Hon Hai one. Seems like a solid company but I’m not seeing much growth. (All CAGRs;) 10 Year sales 4.5%, 5 year 3%, 1 year -3%. And the dividend yield isnt high enough to compensate.

I think between Hon Hai & TSM, why settle for Hon Hai? Are they expected to make some investments that starting growing their business again?; Woah pretty solid finds. Thanks; A year ago I thought lvmh would struggle in Asia because of china economy . I was right; TOU dividend isnt high enough for me for a div stock.

I’m considering CNQ though from your recommendation. Good div and being raised every year. Looks good; Apart from SAP, Allianz and Munich RE Not Really; They have a lot of solid companies. Real high potential for growth? Not a lot.


Some other ones i found for Germany are, Wacker Neuson, Cancom, Adesso; Germany economy is all over the place, tbh.; Not too shabby; Investor track record is no Berkshire….; Just check holdings of Global ex-US value ETF. You'll get some interesting names.


Siemens is great at this point.


I think, in your list, you're also looking at names trading below ATH. There's a reason why they're soft and lost the momentum.; Due to political turmoil. Samsung is litterary the South Korean Government. They are the biggest share holder and Samsung is deeply ingrained into society running schools, hospitals, stores, renting out apartments etc.



If there is pilticial turmoil in South Korea Samsung tumbles, if there is stability Samsung does good. If Samsung hits a rough patch...Korea suffers.; I think it’s reasonably priced although I don’t own it. It made 750 million free cash flow last quarter. 4x that for four quarters and you’ve got 3 billion annual free cash flow. So it’s trading at 33 forward free cash flow while it’s expected to grow profits by 140% next year; They are aiming for 100 billion in revenue in 2030. if they hit that, their stock will be anywhere from 5x to 10x  6 years from now. Easily the #1 European stock.


BTW the 100 billion target was announced 2 years ago, and so far they say they are executing ahead of schedule; You didn't specify that value was a criteria, or what you used to determine that city might add more value to your post to clarify.; Why would you choose between Hon Hai and TSM? Just get both (and TSM is overvalued right now compared to the TWSE ticker, the PE gap is around 6 when it usually stays below 3).

Hon Hai/Foxconn does open new factories and assembly lines to meet demand. My thesis for them is simple: strong company with high expertise in their field. They will grow when the right opportunities present themselves over a 20 year horizon.; BRK.B stock at 2000 32.92  
INVE.B stock at 2000 32 SEK (so \~3$)

BKB.B now 463.87 or 14x  
INVE.B now 303.87 or 9.5x  
Investor also has a annual dividend of roughly 2% 

The last 5 years Investor is up 135% and Berkshire is up 100%

What metric are you judging berkshire on that you feel investor is failing at?; Investor AB has outperformed Berkshire over most time frames, for both intrinsic and stock price; Which ones?; It's still a moderately Cathy Wood style investment. I think they are a great company and their products are best or near in class, but they don't have a clear path to new growth in the future.; Yea I probably shouldve done that. I didnt put too much effort into the post itself, most of it went into the actual analysis (not shown); TSM is growing 20%+, Hon Hai is around 5%. I wouldn’t say TSM is that much more overvalued than Hon Hai given its growth rate; There's an index for that - MSCI World ex USA Value Index; I wasn't comparing TSM's valuation to Hon Hai. I was comparing it to 2330, which tends to have a PE gap from TSM of 3 or less but it is around 6 now. 2330 is TSM's Taiwan Stock Exchange ticker. Also keep in mind that the company is trading at a high premium to historical PEs which means one bad quarter can cause the company to crater in value. This is a cylical industry and once the current capex cycle ends the company's revenue and earnings growth will stabilize. I'm not going to attempt to predict a peak value for the stock price in the next five years since that is way beyond my depth and most pros get it wrong anyway.

Hon Hai (2317) is available at a much cheaper valuation so comes with margin of safety and an asymmetric payoff if you have a long term vision. I have bought it with a 20 year outlook in mind. I also own a decent amount of 2330 relative to my portfolio size.; I meant which stocks have lost their momentum for you; Do you kmow what the difference is between 2330 & TSM? Looks like its for the same company, TSMC, but i can’t figure out why there would be a PE gap at all between the US ticker and the Taiwanese at all. Seems like it would be for currency rates maybe? Or higher US interest than Taiwan. Is there a way to buy 2330 in the US besides $TSM? ; Brooo.. come on, look at volume charts, falling prices. 


Sorry to say, unless one has reasonably OK ""trend spotting"" skills, they won't do well in markets. Best to stick to index.; 2330 is the actual share which is traded on TWSE, while TSM is an ADR which has a claim to 5 shares of 2330.

Interactive Brokers offers trading on TWSE and that is what I use as a non-US person."
Stocks or Real estate which is better???,"Age old question... which has better returns? I realize it's apples & oranges! But looking for thoughts & advice!

North East rental market looks like $400-700 profit a month is possible. If I spent 300k on downpayments for 10 doors. I imagine in 30 years I'd make 8.5k a month. Or (100k) a year approximately. 

If I invested 300k in a mutual fund or etf or dividend fund could I expect to take $100k out for approximately 40 years...

Thanks",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ha9zpw/stocks_or_real_estate_which_is_better/,0,2024-12-09 14:43:15,"You’re over simplifying things. What about tenants who are not paying rent, damage your property, vacancies, repairs, increased taxes, and eviction costs?


The difference between the two aren’t just purely returns. You have to ask yourself do I want to run a business, or do I just want to invest in stocks?; I owned rental properties but sold them to invest and trade options for income. 

The calls in the middle of the night and other problems with houses and tenants was not something I wanted to deal with as I got older.; [deleted]; Financial planner here.  The truth is people have made a lot of money in both over the years.  The key issue is liquidity; if you need money fast and you have an investment account, you can click a button and have money in your bank account in a couple days.  That simply is not possible with real estate.  If liquidity is not a concern at all, then real estate can be a great investment.  Good luck!; Stocks. Real estate sucks; Rentals are a hassle. 

I rented my first house out for 3 years and got about a 4% real return after shenanigans.  

Market would have been about 10% return during the time period and no headache.  

Now. If you had a bunch of real estate prior to 2019 and held it until today, you'd be sitting pretty.; Usually it is like this:  
Stocks - higher volatility, higher risk, higher return  
Real estate - more work (tenats, reconstructions, repairs), higher stability  
It's always a subjective topic; I like stocks.
Liquidity, risk control, transaction costs, viable for my finances.; Sounds like a question for an FA. Stocks or index funds are certainly more “low touch” than real estate.; You can invest passively in rental RE without being a slum lord,; Real estate investing isn't as easy as you think it is, and someone with no experience in the game can get burned very, very easily. If you want the best of both worlds, invest in REITs. Otherwise, just stick to ETFs. Real estate can depend so much on where you are actually located in the world (Country>State>Region) whereas the same factors do not apply to stocks.; Have both. Use real estate to help build your stock portfolio.; Real stocks; Real estate companies have historically earned about as much as the S&P 500, [around 10%](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/060415/what-average-annual-return-typical-long-term-investment-real-estate-sector.asp) give or take depending on the segment. So it’s kind of a matter of preference. 

You could always split the difference by investing in a real estate company. Real Estate Investment Trusts are publicly-listed companies who own properties and for tax reasons distribute a majority of their profits to shareholders, in many cases paying out each month. It also allows access to segments most of us couldn’t afford to get into on our own. I can’t buy a [ski resort](https://eprkc.com/portfolio/experiential/ski/) or a [medical office building](https://www.americanhealthcarereit.com/about/) but I could own a sliver of a company that does. (Not recommendations, just examples.)

—

You don’t mention price appreciation, but many real estate investors count on that for wealth building, and that’s where the phrase “down payments” becomes very important. Borrowing to invest amplifies any gains or losses from the value of the investment itself.

(The interest on that debt can also put you on the clock; lots of small-time landlords depend on this month’s rent to cover this month’s mortgage.); Both.  Use Real Estate as a bond substitute using Benjamin Graham's approach.  Between 25% and 75% in each.; All preference me lad. I’m all stocks, however if I had like $2M-5M in stocks, I would want to diversify into real estate.; I sold my stocks and bought real estate. It’s a better investment.; great response; What if I made them sign some sort of legal document saying they need to pay every month and are responsible for damages? 

If they don’t pay put their kids out on the street in the cold, that should teach them.; Were you a landlord that actually received a 3am busted pipe phone call?; Relying on historical averages can be misleading—past performance isn't destiny. Real estate offers unique tax advantages and leverage opportunities that stocks can't match. Depreciation deductions and mortgage interest write-offs can significantly boost real returns, which isn't trivial if you're optimizing for cash flow. Plus, with leverage, your return isn't just on your investment but also on the bank's money. Price appreciation is crucial but not guaranteed, and local markets can outperform national averages. With REITs, you get diversification but miss out on control and potential tax deferrals from direct property ownership. Real estate's not just numbers—it's about strategy.; As opposed to paying whenever, and not being responsible?

What an original idea!; Not exactly at 3am, but once at 3:25am.; Yup and those who don’t follow the rules go to jail which would make up for the financial losses at least for me; That's entirely different! /s"
$GOOG the BFTG,"
Regards, grab your tendies and gather around the fire because I’m going to tell you all about *$GOOG* (aka Alphabet) the BFTG (Big Fucking ~~Tech~~ Tendie Giant). I’ll break it down for you because I know you polish that 🧠 real nice so I can’t expect a single wrinkle. 

1. Criminally Low P/E Ratio

While all your other tech darlings are flexing P/E ratios like a hooker in heat, $GOOGL is at 23.4 P/E ratio.

For reference:
* $SPX: >27 P/E (yes, the S&P500)
* $MSFT: >36 P/E
* $AAPL: >39 P/E
* $NVDA: >56 P/E
* $AMZN: >47 P/E
* $TSLA: >106 P/E (Fuck you, for the window lickers in the back)

Remember a “good” P/E ratio is traditionally around 20-25. If you don’t understand then read a fucking book.

2. AI Incumming

Sure, everyone’s talking about OpenAI and ChatGPT, but who’s making real money here? Google owns 90%+ of search traffic (when did you ever hear “yahoo it” or “ask duck duck go”?) and monetizes it like a legal cartel. Once Gemini (+Legacy Bard) gets some improvements and a little lipstick even MORE money. Oh, and don’t forget Google Cloud, which grew revenues 30% YoY last quarter.

3. Santa Rally - Ho Ho Hold Onto Your Bollocks 🎅

Historically, December is green season for big-cap tech. Funds rebalance, and retail apes are YOLOing. The Santa Rally isn’t just a meme; it’s a statistical goldmine. With $GOOG’s recent earnings beat ($28.5B in 3 months), the market’s about to price this in as snow starts falling.

4. Big Tech = Safe Haven

Recession? Inflation? Global chaos? Who cares. Big Tech don’t give a *FUCK*. Ad spending may wobble, but companies will NEVER stop buying Google ads.

5. Buybacks on Steroids

$GOOGL has a $70 BILLION buyback program active, the best part? They’re buying low and will push us even higher.

TL;DR: Google Is The Perfect Combo of Value & Growth.

Google is big and their P/E is at a historically normal level?; If you replace the G’s in GOOG with B’s you get BOOB; Just to add some more.

I'm biased as I have 4000 shares and $50k calls on this YOLO.

* waymo is beating tesla by MILES and years. The announcement of expansion made uber and lyft share price tank by almost 9% last week.

* google cloud is growing at 30%+

*YouTube is set to be have more hours watched then Netflix and cable TV combined. The ban of tiktok will be bullish for YouTube shorts and also $META reels.

* google Deepmind is one of the most advanced Tech hubs in the world. Some insane secretive work they do in tech & medical and more.

* They are the mag7 that are investing the most in Ai. Gemini expanding and they've made Ai for game makers. Don't forget $msft made its Ai move by partnering with openAi. But google is far ahead imo of products.

* search isn't going anywhere. Actually Grew almost 11% last earnings and is the cash cow. So much money they don't know what to do with it.

The most negative thing about is this the DOJ breakup. Or else google would be $250+ imo. 

Don't let that fool you.  Chromium is way too much if a risk and threat to break and sell off so it ain't going anywhere.; this just proves everything else is disgustingly overvalued; Who would've thought a tech giant is gonna make money; I’m copying your calls.; This already aged fairly well ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882); Already hold a million in this stock, maybe I should sell....; Well because of you I made 700 dollars this morning and took profits.

Got it. 📝; Baba is better; I’m down $10k on GOOG after buying the top.; i doubt that the average PE of the S&P500 is that high. Look at the PE without the Mag7 and the average is radically different.; A safer way to do this is to buy deeper in the money calls. Less risk, higher delta, less need for a massive move, less theta.; Did you ask yourself why Alphabet has the lowest P/E of the names you listed?; you actually have data and analysis to back up your trades?? LOSER!; So far it rose since premarket, despite the market pooftin' around since US open.

Hoping to nab a few more early tomorrow sub 180.  Hell I might just keep loading up to 200 and let em simmer for a few years; How are you not gonna mention Waymo??; Didn’t even mention the massive TikTok ban catalyst, otherwise NICE; I oppose speculative bubble valuation. Stock prices should be based on business performance. A P/E ratio of 20 is very normal and average; it can pay dividends to shareholders. If you're just after profit, I suggest buying Bitcoin or drugs; those are pure profit, with greater returns come greater risks.; Even if you don’t read any of this guys DD. Just know the risk reward is good for goog right now. If you don’t know what that wlis. Stop investing lmao; Bro just tax loss harvest ur goog bags. 

Also, stopped reading as soom as i saw “bard”; Fuck you Tesla indeed; Why google went from 150 to  87 a share from 11/21 to 11/22? Overall Bear market or?; Any worries about the FTC

Even Google search is crap compared to what it used to be. ; Can’t wait until they are broken up; Has anyone ever heard of this “Google” sounds like something your grandma use to do in the depression times to get ahead in the bread line.; one of the most shit stock of tech 

always fuck call; I laugh every time I see someone reference Googles PE. Clearly you don't know how to use PE amongst different companies/industries. ; [deleted]; [deleted]; I bet OP bought 3-4 months old calls at the top back in Aug and he's getting desperate as it reaches expiry date; Your welcome - this is your sign to double downs; Lmfao; is it goog or googl now; I don't like shorting but op really made me want to buy some; Me too. Fuck!!; OP is a true regard. Goog is about to get anally intruded by the DOJ.; Buy $GOOG instead its better; Their balance sheet is a fortress and their valuation is criminally low.

Don’t agree? Inverse me and let’s check in for 6 months time.; SOLD TO THE MAN WITH THE DRAGON. HOW DID I NOT SEE THE SIGNS?! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258); this is the comment I came here to read; Boobs are undervalued.

And AI is eating the Google ad business.  I rarely use Google search anymore and I don’t see why you want too since search is mostly stupid links to Reddit.  And why read all the Reddit comments when you can just get it straight from chatgpt or claude or perplexity???; And therefore Google is undervalued - I don’t make the rules I just want tendies; Idk, Intel manages to post billions of losses somehow ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); How insightful, did you use chatGPT for that? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883); I wish us both good fortune and Godspeed ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882); Fine wine and a good time.. for now ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275); ngl it flew today so...; .. me some more calls? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883); how do some of ya'll have so much money.

NVDA is on 65B and would need to maintain its current performance for years to justify its current valuation.; literally 0 reason to buy google over NVDA other than boomeritis; Oh I’m sorry did you want some garbage to invest in? Buy some $HAWK and you can TUAH on that thang.; Hey, I don’t make tradition - the present market and my current positions completely oppose it ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); Trump has said specifically that breaking up big tech would be bad for US competitiveness with China.; Would be really suprised if they let chromium go into foreign ownership.

I can't imagine usa being happy when China buys 50% of google search.

Hence very unlikely to happen. And if it does, shareholders will still own the company. Just spun off as 2 separate stocks.; Possibly but I think the shock from DOJ has settled - it just comes down to if there’s action from the new leadership, who are generally against disbanding this kind of thing. Least of all to overseas investment.; If Google is forced to sell off parts of their company they could just sell it to a fully Chinese company since they would be the highest bidder.

I agree other things being expensive doesn’t make it worth more but I feel it’s undervalued and oversold. 

Hell their market cap is over a Tril below their realistic equivalents.; Amen - and my risk/reward here is all 6 months from expiry; This mfer says “bags” when staring at a current gain with proof of positions.

Make it make sense ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); I believe it’s true value against the current market is near 220, but it will hinge on public sentiment with the ongoing DOJ/FCA disputes and that’s assuming the tech market doesn’t shit the bed; Trump is in power shortly and if track record is of any evidence impact will be minimal in the long run. I’m banking also in the short run or I’m not getting a home anytime soon.

Being 4x under the SPX PE ratio as this large a whale is non sensible to me. That said I’m buying OTM options, so with that what you will.; Still haven’t seen a single person make a purchase through ChatGPT and I’ve asked hundreds of customers - they consult ChatGPT but they still use Google to find and purchase the product.

Inverse me sweet cheeks ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); “AI killed Google”?  What in the fuck. I assume you’re talking about large language models and you think that is what AI is.  That people are still so ignorant about it makes Google a great investment right now.; What do you use that solves this issue?

I run a business and GAds are (annoyingly) best in class.; Ugh have you tried yahoo search? It is honestly awful as compared to Google. It's become the default search option on a lot of browsers without changing it, and you definitely notice the difference in quality of search returns.; !remindme 6months; What’s a good tech stock in your view?

That would be more like META at $90, with a P/E of 7.  GOOG just looks like a very, very good buy right now with an industry low P/E ration in the face of increasing revenue and net income without getting into their other ventures like AI and Waymo. ; I don’t disagree google is a good company, but all of your analysis on it is for long term. If you’re looking 6 months in the future you could be way up or way down. That’s just noise; Good luck, I like it but what do you think of the DOJ? Goog is getting dogged by that. Also the TSLA put, just because? I am long shares goog tsla; In that case, we can’t forget our class A: BOOBL; it wont be sold either; Let's goooo!!!

I love gooogle. I'm holding onto this and see this easy going $200 by Jan. $250 by June.

Already up 1% overnight market.; I'm just looking at my phone now and WHAT THE FUCK. 


Idk what to do. What are you doing? Looks like a run up ath?; not just YET.

  
Needs $250; The money is in searching for buying goods or services. Buying a chair? You google it and look for the places that sell it. Looking for a lawyer? You google it and look for one in your area to contact. Unless ChatGPT starts building or buying out an ad platform, they will only rely on subscription fees to grow. Thats not to say it’s not a lucrative business (ie enterprise subscriptions), but then you need to price it against likes of MSFT growth in that area.; You do realize GOOGL has Gemini which is superior to ChatGPT, and is integrated within google search already. Just ask chatGPT if you don’t believe me ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275); This is definitely one of the bigger issues Google is facing right now. Losing market share to other AI powered search engines. People are also turning more and more to places like reddit and Instagram when searching for opinions on products and services.; You know, that's great, I enjoyed my 20% run up in these shares over the last 3 years.  And I had to log into my brokerage to look it up, too.  Good thing I didn't have to get up off the couch.  Point is, I could've had NVDA instead and had a five bagger for my trouble.

Why was I wrong then, and somehow I'm right now?  Why can't I just be wrong now too?  Why can't you kids leave an old man in peace?!; I was referring to the big 5 tech giants; Funny thing is I already had my alarm set for tomorrow morning and it said google calls. You confirmed my trade.; If only i had grabbed more calls!! 🤣 the greed is real; I ended up doing 185c and cashed out early ish. 400% gain; Cheapest at $0.11

10 contracts for $110 wont break my port. But GOOG/GOOGL value is def there; AI crash then the real run up starts.; I love your responses 😂😂; Okay that made me laugh.; how about u eat my ASS

I’m very concerned with Google’s leadership, however. They should have a massive advantage in AI and they’ve done nothing to show that they can execute on that advantage.; I agree company will be great but if they have to break up company and compete with companies like Trade desk no doubt will be challenging; 🙏🙏🙏; I just spent a couple days in San Francisco and reluctantly took a waymo. I was totally in your corner, but after riding I believe to my core that this is the future. The very near future. They have done 100 million miles already and just started in LA.; You lack vision. And it's exposed by this DD and low iq comment; AI reduce google search, its the fact. There is no ads in ChatGPT yet, but it will happen. AI can suggest purchases already , soon it will accept advertisers, just waiting for more ppl to get into the pool first, same as many other startups. ppl ask AI for gift selections, dinnner location.... More business opporunity will merge. The bottom line is that search engine will be less impactful and thats the core business of google.; reddit..; You bet $3000, I wipe my ass with $3000.

China's domination playbook. How China dominates industry after industry.,"This is not the full story, but it is a very important story. Let's talk about how China dominates industry after industry. I will use the term ""China"" because Chinese government is highly involved in making Chinese manufacturers dominant.

**Part 1 – What is happening in automotive?**

In mere 3 years, China became the world's largest car exporter. The growth hasn't stopped either. The playbook that China is using is not new, we've seen it before. In solar panels, smartphones and a bunch of other industries. Let's talk about that playbook further down.

[From: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/1h9idy8\/](https://preview.redd.it/e4fn1lzarn5e1.png?width=1220&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f3b7d8ae6b41af72118921dea652a78f4995af1)

**Part 2 – Smartphones showed the way**

Around 2005, Chinese mobile phones were shit. They were mostly knockoffs of Nokia, SonyEricsson, Samsung and other established makers. Really bad knockoffs as well. Cheap, nasty, unreliable, uncomfortable user interface, etc. Market share outside China was near 0%.

Around 2010, large part of Chinese mobile phones were still knockoffs (examples [here](https://www.intomobile.com/2009/07/25/this-week-in-fake-devices-3-sony-ericsson-clones/) and [here](https://www.intomobile.com/2009/07/25/this-week-in-fake-devices-3-sony-ericsson-clones/)). But you now had som ok-ish Chinese products, e.g. [Huawei U8150](https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_u8150_ideos-3513.php), [Lenovo Q330](https://www.gsmarena.com/lenovo_q330-4860.php), [ZTE Blade](https://www.gsmarena.com/zte_blade-3391.php), [Meizu MX](https://www.gsmarena.com/meizu_mx-4373.php) and others. They were not good, but they were passable.

In less than 10 years, before 2020, some of the world's best smartphones were from Chinese makers. [Huawei Mate 20 Pro](https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_mate_20_pro-9343.php), [OnePlus 7T Pro](https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_mate_20_pro-9343.php), [Oppo Reno 10x](https://www.gsmarena.com/oppo_reno_10x_zoom-9654.php) and others.

Just before US sanctions, Huawei was world's largest smartphone maker for one quarter. It was about to cement its place as #1. But Huawei got sanctioned and Huawei phones are now barely visible outside of China. What is much less known, is that another Chinese maker become world's largest and it did it so subtly that almost no one knows it. BBK Electronics was similar to VW Group and GM – it owned owned many Chinese makers (Oppo, Vivo, OnePlus, Realme, Iqoo and others). BBK Electronics was world's largest, larger than Apple or Samsung for years. It is now dissolved and is officially not the sole owner, but the all the BBK Electronics brands remain alive and well. They are dominant in many countries around the world. Today, Chinese smartphone makers have more than 60% of global market share. That's dominance.

And that dominance is being acquired in industry after industry.

**Part 3 – China is now dominant in smartphones**

It's all China, apart apart from Apple and Samsung. The remaining non-Chinese makers are super-small, like Sony (Japan), Asus (Taiwan) or Micromax (India) which hold much less than 1% each. Other than Apple and Samsung, it's all China – Xiaomi, Motorola (owned by Chinese Lenovo), Oppo, ZTE, Vivo and so on. China dominates worldwide smartphone market.

**Part 4 – What was the Chinese playbook for smartphones?**

It was a collection of factors, most notably:

1. Large covert govt subsidies.
2. Drive for local supply chain.
3. IP theft on industrial scale.
4. Protectionism in the local market.

Points #1 and #2 were especially impactful. Government subsidies allowed Chinese makers to offer lower prices, win marketshare (at the expense of others) and stay afloat much longer than they would have without the subsidies. This created much larger local production and much stronger supply chain locally in China. Apple's CEO Tim Cook has admitted that strong supply chain makes China much more favourable production location than the USA. Now, even without the cost advantage, China is the most favourable place for smartphone manufacturing. The playbook worked. And they're repeating it elsewhere.

**Part 5 – Same playbook in EVs**

Note how quickly Chinese smartphone makers went from utter garbage to world-class products. It took about 10 years. From there, it did not take long until China became dominant in the world market.

Same playbook is being used in many industries. The playbook worked wonders in solar panels, where China absolutely dominates the global market. The same playbook is now in EVs. And network equipment. And medical consumables. And industrial chemicals. And home appliances. And so on.

If this post reaches any Western automaker by some chance, I could happily share more over PM. For legacy automakers, brace for impact. Smartphone market of 2010 is mostly a graveyard (e.g. Nokia, SonyEricsson, LG, Palm, Blackberry), coma-patients (e.g. Sony, HTC) or Chinese-owned companies (Motorola). This risks to repeat in automotive.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h9uc3a/chinas_domination_playbook_how_china_dominates/,123,2024-12-08 23:14:03,"

[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse); People in the US and Europe did everything to maintain high consumption at the lowest possible cost. China, however, was smart enough to turn this desire for excessive consumption against the consumers themselves.; am i missing the play here? what's your point?; Domination playbook: Government financed “private industry” does what it wants without regulation

Wow.  So deep.; I wouldn't say Huawei are barely visible outside of China, I was in the UAE recently. They are pretty popular there and fhe middle east in general; Blah blah blah.  Can’t compete gotta make excuses. trillions of dollar spent on war while they spent a fraction of that on supply chain and infrastructure.  What do you expect?; If your answer isn't ""protectionism, IP theft, and slave labor"" you're an idiot.; Well west was very happy to have that when China was making toys and plastic stuff. 
But now not so happy when they can make their own jet engines. 
Ok well...; China’s “industry domination playbook” has proven incredibly effective, as seen in smartphones, solar panels, and now EVs. With government subsidies, local supply chain control, and protectionism, they’ve rapidly moved from low-quality products to global dominance in multiple sectors.

The smartphone example shows how quickly legacy players like Nokia and Blackberry fell, replaced by Chinese brands leveraging scale, innovation, and subsidies. The same trajectory is unfolding in EVs, with Chinese manufacturers improving quality and scaling rapidly.

Western automakers and industries need to take this seriously. Without massive investment in innovation, supply chain diversification, and competitive strategies, they risk becoming the next victims of China’s relentless playbook.; Don’t invest in Chinese stocks; “Govt subsidies” 😂 bro thinks the Yuan grow on trees; Eh China's more fucked than the rest of us.; America let it happen; That’s a massive article for the real answer. 

Slave labour.; Puts on China it is.; Bros just shouting nonsense into the void; HEY HOMEY

IT’S ME, TONY; You claim that the Chinese government conducts ""massive hidden government subsidies"" without any evidence.


First of all, lowering business costs is part of the government's responsibility (look at Europe, they went through de-industrialisation after losing Russian gas).


Secondly, you have provided no evidence.


Again, any massive subsidy can't be permanent, and indiscriminate subsidies just result in companies constantly cheating the government for subsidies. Most countries in the world subsidise businesses, but how do you subsidise them to make them competitive? That's the key.


The core is always comprehensive competitiveness.; Solid take; The one industry they fail to dominate and are hopelessly behind is the semiconductor, which is arguably the most important one.; The west (white people as a civilization), preached one thing and practiced another. No Principles, just game theory based life style. China is now playing this same game with the West.; There’s a yin and yang

The yin of anti capitalism is, bloated financials stemming from governmental protectionism/favorable trade policy

The yang is, absence of corporate autonomy from governmental affairs/policy, and the resulting tariffs. 

China is uninvestable

Do not put any money into Chinese stocks.; There are Chinese smartphones?; When u fuck with a devil....get ready to be reamed ...; China is a crazy anti immigration, aging nation with youth who have no intention of having kids. Let’s see how that plays out in their plans for world domination; For EVs they just spent more on research due to decades of factory pollution making the already bad air from sandstorm even worse.; Slave labor is a hell of a drug; Your 4 points basically comes down to they stole it...if that's all it takes lol; Not hard to dominate a bunch of industries when you have a 1.4 billion slave labor… 

However, their dominance is solely the fault of Murican government (congress) that allowed our greedy ass corporations to put their greed / profits over country, its citizens, and allies around the world.; China's hosed. What is this nonsense.; There's still room for appetite. ; This. It's also blame American corps for taking the cheaper labor. Manufacturing jobs left the US decades ago, and much of it now resides in China/SEA.; Terrible for business long term, then again, no one accused communists of being smart; It was around 2 AM when I got your message, sorry that I didn't see it on time.

My point was that China has proven ability to dominate an industry within 5 years of making a competitive product. This is now happening in automotive (with consequences for automotive makers), home appliances (a bunch of publicly traded companies) and elsewhere.; Can’t forget slave wages, stealing IP, and protectionism. ; That was just typical west arrogance. If it’s not the west it doesn’t count as a place. Same for any Chinese success is theft and oppression, never about competence and efficiency.; Wait so china is prosperous again? The rhetoric has been for the last 2 years that china is on the brink of an epic economic collapse, now they’re suddenly taking over the world again ??? Peter zeihan sure is an asshat.; If those three were all that were needed, even Africa would have been prosperous; China also buys Iranian sanctioned oil for significantly cheaper that market rate.

Cheap fuel -> Low cost of energy + slaves + gov protectionism = significantly cheaper goods; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189); Your nonsense perfectly explained your ignorance. Can Americans be even less creative? Just because US dominated the industry by protectionism, IP theft and slave labor between WWI and WWII doesn’t mean others have to. Learn your bloody history and open your eyes.; Smartphones, photovoltaics, and EVs are all easy to copy technology.; Th OP is thinking long-term, u r thinking quarter by quarter and going by stock market index.; that's the excuse America goes to when they realize their unionized workforces are completely uncompetitive against other countries' workforces

China's salaries are laughably low compared to America, and SE Asia even more so; literally. you can’t have insane profit margins without exploiting people. the cost has to be cut somewhere.; In EVs, it's actually worse than slave labour; it's also the genocide labour of their Uyghurs in Xingang. They're forced into labour prisons while their families are held hostage/ransom. They process a ton of lithium and aluminum.     
     
Edit: the Chinese shills/trolls/bots are out flipping votes. It's wild Reddit hasn't controlled that shit yet.; Put your money in china you say?; The number of bots in this thread is fucking wild. 

Invest in Chinese companies guys!!!! They’re definitely not on the brink of financial collapse and massively underperforming American indexes!!!!!!; White people as a civilization 

wtf kinda dumb shit did you just write

All the white ppl fuckin chilln together now?

Need I point out the sides in the last 2 world wars?; Honestly I see it the exact same as you… how many sheer number of items are made in china and bought by us… preached one thing, and practiced another for sure. The cost cut is at human exploitation over there. We just don’t see it here and don’t think about it at all.; Then bet on China lol. It’s a paper tiger economically and a paper tiger as a country. It’s a hellhole that runs on slave labor. I would rather not given every indicator that chinas performance metrics are faux; Sarcasm? :); that's the excuse America goes to when they realize their unionized workforces are completely uncompetitive against other countries' workforces

China's salaries are laughably low compared to America, and SE Asia even more so; Look at how much richer the top 20 billionaires have gotten since COVID. Double if not triple in net worth and we're talking from a base of 50-100b. Heck Elon himself is close to 400b this year. Insane the amount of wealth greed has generated for them; Th OP is thinking long-term, u r thinking quarter by quarter and going by stock market index.; Sir just one more bite, it's wafer thin.; I don't think so. They became a 'world factory,' and now they are able to develop their own technology.

I don't live in the USA, but my car has ZERO parts from the USA. The same goes for my smartphone, video game, and so on.

It's terrible for the USA, not China.; hmmm okay sorry you're from europe; What is your point? Can you not read? 

This is an investing sub. Everyone knows history. ; pretty good for a developing third world country ; It’s collapsing. But, their ev industry is doing well. 

I think Chinese households’ net worth is 80% real estate, or something? What happens when that crashes? It’s also like 30% of the economy. ; But it’s already happening. What’s China’s GDP last year, and what was it 10 years ago? And how did the average home price fare in the last 3 years? Chinese-made solar panels dominating the world is no more impressive or threatening than Chinese-made socks dominating the world.; Except Africa is a continent, not a country with a solidified coherent policy towards their own companies.

And lack of infrastructure; Wait, so, capitalism, evolution, free markets, survival of the fittest again? Just like the west did in the 1600s? Humans haven't become more moral, just more informed?


Despite tariffs, weaponization of the US dollar?


Damn, who would've thought; > sanctioned oil

as it turns out sanctions are a two-way street and deprives the sanction-er of cheaper goods as well

> slaves

that's the excuse America goes to when they realize their unionized workforces are completely uncompetitive against other countries' workforces

China's salaries are laughably low compared to America, and SE Asia even more so; No. We are very much thinking that by every metric China has Faux success. There are so many indicators that China is a tightrope act and they are barely balancing it.

Their main car export is to Russia, who has no domestic car productions to note as well as a high demand for cheaper, low quality vehicles. Following it are countries with high population but lower income averages.; Long term actually is the big problem China has; did you skip like half the post where OP was talking about subsidies?; In the future ai and robots; [deleted]; People were poorer before Deng Xiaoping turned China into capitalism but with a lot more large state companies. If it's slave labor now what do you call it before China became a global manufacturer. In fact it's gotten too expensive to make clothes in China so more of it gets made in poorer countries like India or Vietnam today.; Sadly the US is also becoming a paper tiger. I just wish we have a better choice for government that's not controlled by a bunch of billionaires. Hopefully Trump doesn't extend his 4 year term somehow. He has promised a bunch of economic metrics that seem absurd but let's see what happens; Honestly no.  Unless you are just talking about manufacturing idk what brand is Chinese

Apple, Samsung are the only two I can legit say off the top of my head.  

Do you mean Huawei?; I don’t think America could get away with 11 million Uyghur slaves. Good try though!; You’re a Chinese bot; What technology did China develop?; Pissing off your costumers doesn’t seem like smart business long term. Besides, China copies, doesn’t innovate, so they’re not irreplaceable. Automation can significantly slow their economy. Automation runs on AI, an American invention.; What happens when the world factory moves to India and Vietnam; exactly. they might dominate some markets but that doesn't mean they dont have massive internal tensions; ok - so it seems we need coherent sensible policies as well. What else?; Protectionism isn’t free markets. The market is controlled by the government, it’s a dictatorship. It’s not the fittest who survive, it’s those who get government support. 

Slave labor, government aided IP theft, currency manipulation, huge tariffs… China is definitely not ‘capitalism, free markets, survival of the fittest’. ; Excuse?

Is it an excuse?

I’d say it’s a recognition of fact and reality; Not really. Why are we tariffing them then?; You are being downvoted into oblivion and will be attacked with false stats and whataboutism lol. Reddit is on its way to become infested by misinformation like YouTube comment section 😂; Dude subsidies alone do not make stuff materialise.; Share them pls; Lmao; I guess it depends on how trumps private prison industry plays out. We may be seeing these numbers surge in the next few years and reach hundreds of thousands if not million+ more than what we already have  in prison slave labors

What USians gonna do? Pay more for the products? Took off the production from China and start to produce in USA paying a higher salary? 


> China copies, doesn’t innovate

Something tells me that you know nothing about the world outside the USA. Car sales of US brands keep declining outside the USA, while Chinese brands continue to rise.

Your 'AI' can't even run without Chinese hardware supply.

Besides that, China's economy keeps growing every year, making its internal market HUGE, with over 1 billion people ready to spend money on Chinese products.; They are not just the world's factory anymore, they supply technology to the world. In my country, we have more Chinese car brands than American ones. All the electric cars are from Chinese brands.

And just think for a second: Who would make more money if India became rich (or less poor)? China or the West?; China moves on to competing in IP and design with Europe and US, exactly what’s happening now, US having to ban TikTok like China banning Google and YouTube before. What, you think the West has a god given right to the high value work?; fine then, neither is the US in 1600s to 1900s:

""In 1789, Congress passed a tariff act , imposing a 5% flat rate tariff on all imports. Between 1792 and the war with Britain in 1812, the average tariff level remained around 12.5%. In 1812, all tariffs were doubled to an average of 25%, in order to cope with the increase in public expenditure due to the war.

In 1816, a new law was introduced to keep the tariff level close to the wartime level—especially protected were cotton, woolen, and iron goods. The American industrial interests that had blossomed because of the tariff lobbied to keep it, and had it raised to 35 percent in 1816. The public approved, and by 1820, America's average tariff was up to 40 percent.

According to [Michael Lind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Lind), protectionism was America's de facto policy from the passage of the Tariff of 1816 to World War II, ""switching to free trade only in 1945.""

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectionism\_in\_the\_United\_States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectionism_in_the_United_States)

The US invented that shit. China's merely trying to perfect it for their own use cases. Don't forget your world history.

Use whatever holier-than-thou morals you want, but countries and peoples and systems are all like organisms. It's always survival of the fittest (Russia/Ukraine, Israel/Palestine, China/Taiwan).; Yeah it’s a really dumb excuse. They literally write those “slave labour” articles to clickbait brainlets. Don’t out yourself next time.; [deleted]; Because of product saturation. Pseudo Slave labor allows higher production numbers and cheaper production costs, meaning they can inflate the amount of production lines and exports.

They also have complete control of significant rare earth metals used in electronics which are, like usual, produced by pseudo slave labor. 

As for why we are tariffing them? That’s just the standard operation for a country that oversaturates the market for given products. Or, it could simply be the ideals of a party to cut competition. 

What’s the reason for tariffing Canada and Mexico? Is it because they’re economic goliaths that will surpass the U.S.? No. It’s because of people’s ideals.; [deleted]; I guess it would also depend on if prisoners and slaves were the same thing.

https://www.google.com/search?q=are+prisoners+the+same+as+slaves; Hope you got your penny for the post; IDK, I wanted you to answer my question; Ohh you’re not even in the U.S., your viewpoint makes a lot more sense now, wish Reddit would add country flags next to profiles; lol you love China long time… didn’t even realize your are ex U.S. ✌️; Sorry that doesn’t compute. China has all the manufacturing. We’re just hurting ourselves… you can’t tariff IP; I’m sorry. What is this slave labor? You mean cheap manufacturing that the US outsourced? Btw, China is too expensive now because they took 800 million out of poverty. All the manufacturing is moving to Vietnam and India.; >very credible pieces written by an expert on the genocide, Adrian Zenz.

For example, with Japan invented: QR codes, digital microphones, and camera phones. What technology did China develop?; > Buddy not only is he a German

the guy is literally living in the US and working for organizations funded by US State Department propaganda efforts

as if I will buy the fiction where Israel kills tens of thousands of children but isn't genocide, but somehow incarceration is?; > German?

he's currently living and working in the US for organizations funded by the US State Department's propaganda arms; The first 3 links are funded by US though. Genocide Watch I believe is funded by USAID. USHM is funded by US Holocaust Memorial Council which is funded by Congress. UK Parliament issued a motion not vote and was attended by only 23 of 650 MPs. A motion just means they can move forward to debate and then vote to decide if it's indeed a genocide or not.; [deleted]; [deleted]; > admitted the genocide themselves

https://www.xinjiangpolicefiles.org/key-documents/

these documents simply show the mechanism for prison security and protocols, and as I've said mass incarceration is not genocide when you aren't killing the prisoners (otherwise US internment of Japanese-Americans and present-day US mass incarceration are somehow also genocides on par with Auschwitz gas chambers?); > Did you see the evidence and piece I linked from the Holocaust Memorial Museum?

your link doesn't have any evidence, only written text accusations

Portfolio Talk,"Hello all, after months of my own research I've made a portolio. I want to preface this by saying this is not a post looking for advice. I am just wanting to tell you all the investments I've made and the reasons behind them. Also, there is some overlap between my individual picks and my ETF picks. I know.

**First, the foundation**

Like any smart investor you need a solid base. Something that will grow steadily and won't make you want to sell out when there is an inevitable market crash. This is why for my first pie, I have gone with 80% VUAG and 20% IGLA.

**Tech Focus**

People may say that my portfolio is too heavily weighted towards the USA and tech, I think the tech giants like Apple etc are not going anywhere. So my allocations are as follows,

Amazon- Moving into the AI space with Nova, Revenue growing steadily YOY.

Microsoft- Almost in the 'too big to fail' category. Not going anywhere and an easy choice IMO.

Alphabet- Recovered well and quickly after 2022 crash. Massive AI player. Easy choice

Apple- Still most popular in the Phone space. Can only see this stock going one way.

Meta- Absolutely flying in recent years. Hopeful Zuck will keep it up.

ASML- Riskier pick but believe they will have a good year next year. Looking 4-5 years into the future with this one.

Nvidia- Don't think I need to say too much with this choice. Looking long term, very excited about this one.

IonQ- Main player in quantum computing space, looking at some volatile years upcoming but I have faith that they could be huge in 5+ years.

**Consumer Focus**

Costco wholesale- Almost unshakeable business model, no strong competition IMO.

Pets at home- Smaller allocation for this one. Seems undervalued to me as people are always going to treat their pets. Will keep tabs on this one as still unsure.

Procter and Gamble- Been around for a million years. Very stable with dividend growth YOY.

Walmart- Consumer powerhouse in USA, strong financials and IMO not going anywhere,#

**Finance Focus**

Berkshire Hathaway- Trust in Buffett, no pressure from short term market trends.

Intuit- Dividend growth YOY, in an incredible place financially.

JP Morgan and Chase- In the 'too big to fail' category in my opinion. Involved in so many industries so not dependent on one for revenue.

MasterCard- Very able to adapt to the market, only risk is inflation IMO.

PayPal- After share price crash in 2022. Revenues didn't faulter and net income bounced back within the year. Undervalued IMO.

S&P Global- Adapting well to new tech such as AI. Been around forever.

**Real Estate Focus**

Realty income- Unshaken by the market crashes in past 20 years. Dividend Growth YOY.

VICI properties- Predictable revenue due to triple net leases. In a strong financial postion.

However I’ll give you my 0.02¢;

If this is in line with your strategy and what you want, your comfortability in that sector, go for it.

Since most of my capital comes from trading and that in and of itself can be draining mentally, I don’t want to think when it comes to investing. A simple SPY 60% / 25% SCHD / 15% other stocks I pick work for me.  (I chose spy since I like selling covered calls); Which Berk? Baby Berk?

Just as important is proper asset allocation and using a trailing stop, or knowing your exit before you buy. I use 4% asset allocation with a 25% trailing stop.; I understand your view. I am just very interested in investing and love a more hands on approach rather than the ‘set it and forget it’ thought process."
Portfolio allocation talk,"Hello all, after months of my own research I've made a portolio. I want to preface this by saying this is not a post looking for advice. I am just wanting to tell you all the investments I've made and the reasons behind them. Also, there is some overlap between my individual picks and my ETF picks. I know.

**First, the foundation**

Like any smart investor you need a solid base. Something that will grow steadily and won't make you want to sell out when there is an inevitable market crash. This is why for my first pie, I have gone with 80% VUAG and 20% IGLA.

**Tech Focus**

People may say that my portfolio is too heavily weighted towards the USA and tech, I think the tech giants like Apple etc are not going anywhere. So my allocations are as follows,

Amazon- Moving into the AI space with Nova, Revenue growing steadily YOY.

Microsoft- Almost in the 'too big to fail' category. Not going anywhere and an easy choice IMO.

Not to be harsh or anything but imo something not going anywhere is not a thesis + where you buy something does matter. You've had an amazing run for tech, if you're going to make at least a medium term case for what brings a material amount of additional buyers from here, what is considerably underappreciated about these businesses at this point?  I don't think there's a turn anytime soon, but I would be surprised if there's not a period in the next few years where people have to come up with a new playbook beyond ""own tech.""

Also, I'd emphasize 2-3 mega cap tech names that you can make the best fundamental case for  vs collecting them all.

COST is a fantastic business, but getting up to around the valuation it had in the dot com period. You can see how it did in the decade or so after. WMT is not cheap vs history either but it is admittedly winning over TGT for the time being.

""Realty Income""

It's not a bad company but imo there are too many people on Reddit who buy this because they think they need yield and then rather buy something where they have a thesis about the company itself (and that company happens to pay a nice dividend) they buy this. If someone is retired or near-retired, fine - but too many people in their 20's/30's owning this. It's not some sort of safe harbor either - a 50% decline in a month early in covid, multiple fairly quick 20%+ drawdowns in recent years - all to get dividends (taken out of the stock price + taxable event) out of owning a portfolio that's about 10% Dollar General, Dollar Tree and Walgreens stores. IMO, people have elevated the idea of dividends too much.

This is not a bad portfolio, but I think you have to have more reasoning behind some of these choices and a lot of these names have been on quite a run/feel varying degrees of crowded - reasoning imo becomes more important when you're trying to justify why something like NVDA can continue in the manner it has been or why AAPL can sustain this multiple.; Are these all just the top companies with the safest bet that they will continue to grow?; I ain't reading all that.

DD Part 1 -->[ here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h7s0om/rbrk_rubrik/).

**What is Rubrik ?** 

* Rubrik is a backup & recovery provider that sits on top of a company’s cloud infrastructure.

**What is an example of Backup & Recovery I can maybe understand?** 

* You drop your phone under a tire because you were to busy while parking, leading to a smashing of both it and the SIM card. The only fix is you buy a new phone, login with your iCloud email, and everything is restored from the cloud.
* Rubrik does the above and sells at-cost servers from partners like Dell, HPE, SMCI, etc. They protect data in places like AWS , Azure, and GCP.
* People pay whatever when they have no phone or car. Same here.

Given Rubrik's recent performance and market position, here are a few option strategies you might consider:

1. \*\*Long Call\*\*: If you're bullish on Rubrik and expect the stock price to rise, you could buy a call option. For example, you could buy a call option with a strike price of $60, expiring in January 2025. This allows you to profit from any significant upward movement in the stock price.
2. \*\*Covered Call\*\*: If you already own Rubrik shares and want to generate additional income, you could sell a call option against your shares. For instance, you could sell a call option with a strike price of $70, expiring in April 2025. This strategy allows you to earn premium income while potentially selling your shares at a higher price.
3. \*\*Bull Call Spread\*\*: If you want to limit your risk while still benefiting from a potential rise in Rubrik's stock price, you could consider a bull call spread. This involves buying a call option with a lower strike price (e.g., $60) and selling a call option with a higher strike price (e.g., $70), both expiring in July 2025. This strategy limits your maximum profit but also reduces your initial investment.
4. \*\*Protective Put\*\*: If you own Rubrik shares and want to protect against a potential decline in the stock price, you could buy a put option. For example, you could buy a put option with a strike price of $50, expiring in January 2026. This strategy provides downside protection while allowing you to benefit from any upside in the stock price.
5. \*\*Straddle\*\*: If you expect significant volatility in Rubrik's stock price but are unsure of the direction, you could consider a straddle. This involves buying both a call option and a put option with the same strike price (e.g., $60) and expiration date (e.g., January 2025). This strategy allows you to profit from large price movements in either direction.

My thesis on INTC going into 2025,"I am going to add my technological and geopolitical fundamentals here, because I think these are going to be important factors heading into 2025. Disclaimer: I own 575 shares of Intel at an average PpS of $29.30

I think most analysts are forgetting that the next president is the same guy who is trying to block the acquisition of US steel by Nippon steel at all costs, regardless if it makes financial sense or not because he wants to retain as much American Manufacturing as possible and wants it to succeed.

Most of the ""AI revolution"" has happened over the past 4 years where the administration had no problem letting foreign chip manufacturing take the lead. Intel is competing with TSMC, and TSMC receives massive subsidies and discounts from the Taiwanese government which dwarf the 7.9B (which was even reduced) from the US government. On top of that, the US government is also giving slightly less in subsidies, 6.6B, to TSMC to build in the US. So really, the current administration is not giving Intel an advantage over TSMC. The most effective thing that they could do is levy tariffs against Taiwan, which the next president has gone on record stating he wishes to do, instead of subsidies. This would increase demand for American chip manufacturing; while TSMC can manufacture in the US, CoWoS packaging is done outside of the US, in either Malaysia or Taiwan, and would cause the product to be subject to tariffs.

In the chip design space, Intel is hopelessly behind on GPUs compared to Nvidia, and now Apple, Amazon, OpenAI and others are designing their own chips and using TSMC for manufacture. Intel still dominates the CPU space, but your average datacenter rack might have 10/20+ GPUs for each CPU. AMD is also a viable alternative to Intel for CPUs, and as such takes about 25% of the market. Intel's only way to compete in the GPU space is in the cost performance market, which mainly targets budget gaming, crypto mining, and cheap datacenter. The newest release of the ""Battlemage"" B580 is expected to compete with Nvidia's 4060 at the under $300 MSRP market, which are lofty goals. Nvidia and AMD still have offerings in these spaces but they are not lucrative ones. So Intel is basically competing to be a 3rd rate designer in the US, while they still have the CPU lead it matters a lot less for the lucrative markets right now.

It's clear that on the design front, Intel is not going to receive much help to be successful. While this is their core business and majority of revenue, it is a business they are falling behind substantially compared to others. Design demand is GPUs and they are late to this party. Revenue for products is expected to stagnate or decline unless they have a competitive GPU offering.

However, the US needs to have a domestic cutting edge chip manufacturing supply chain. It has expressed as much as a result of the 2022 supply chain shortage when we realized that letting TSMC manufacture 90% of the world's sub 5nm chips was a bad idea. That was the motivation behind passing the CHIPS act; Pat Gelsinger was instrumental in advising the current administration for this. The method for doing so has left a lot to be desired; Pat himself even expressed as much given the delay in fund disbursement, which in all fairness was only accelerated as a result of the election result and comments from republicans that they wanted to repeal the act.

TSMC is not allowed to have the latest node fabricated in the US by law of the Taiwanese government. This is so that the country keeps its ""Silicon Shield"", the dependence globally to have manufacturing be done there which keeps Taiwan protected from China. But Intel has no such limitation. And TSMC is not able to fufill 100% of the orders for its customers; it is aggressively building more fabs to keep up with the ever increasing demand of AI. This demand exists for Intel to take part of.

So, Intel in the next administration will have a tremendous amount of support for its Foundry, not Products, side of the business. This leaves Intel with a potential alternative to many of the scenarios analysts predict: It could solely dedicate to Foundry and sell off its Products division, most likely to AMD which shares the x86 architecture already and is solely focused on design. This would allow Intel to become a Foundry for external customers without having a conflict of interest, which I suspect is keeping them from customers. The CHIPS act stipulates that Intel has to retain a majority stake of Foundry but NOT Products, so this does not prevent Intel from dedicating itself to Foundry, which is what the US wants.

I think Pat was waiting for the right climate to do this and it is coming soon. It is sad he did not stay long enough to see it happen. If Intel received the same amount of support from the US government that the Taiwanese government gave to TSMC, and was able to win external customers as a result of Tariffs, it could become the US TSMC. Much of this hinges on the 18A and later 14A nodes which are competitive with TSMC 2nm, which is the current cutting edge. But I think this is the desire of Intel and the next administration, and so they will work towards this goal. To diminish foundry would be a slow death for Intel. That is why I am still looking forward to Intel in 2025.

If you got this far, thank you for reading.

EDIT: Now that I think about it, it is also entirely possible for Qualcomm to buy Intel's Products division. I think they expressed as much earlier this year, but being they are primarily ARM I am not sure if it would be a good fit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h8n76e/my_thesis_on_intc_going_into_2025/,145,2024-12-07 08:17:11,"#**TLDR**

**Ticker:** INTC

**Direction:** Up

**Prognosis:** Bullish on INTC for 2025, due to potential shift to foundry business model and anticipated government support under new administration.  OP believes INTC could become the ""US TSMC"".

**Hopium Level:** High. OP owns 575 shares.

**Key Argument:**  Current geopolitical climate favors domestic chip manufacturing. OP believes the next administration will support INTC's foundry business through tariffs and other measures, potentially leading to INTC spinning off its product division (maybe to AMD?!) and becoming a pure-play foundry.; [deleted]; https://preview.redd.it/p56dx4qwqd5e1.png?width=751&format=png&auto=webp&s=761250fe824095a1a3673c14f50865705ae50061; I agree with the Rah Rah US Manufacturing argument and have 100 x $75c expiring in Jan'26 as a bet on that.

No, I don't think it will get that high; its a volatility play. If we get to June and nothing has happened to move the share price up, I'll just dump the options.

I don't believe in Intel enough to bet big. I just believe some stupid government-related crap will happen to run it up a good chunk in a quick burst over the first half of next year.; Intel has shit for company culture, gives shitty pay and have shitty morale. Talents dont want to stay long term and management is incompetent. A company like this is simply not capable of executing what's needed. All the external influences, public or private, are just noise. The fact of the matter is Intel in its current state is a shit company and should be treated as such until strong evidence to the contrary.; # Good view!~~~ I think it's bottom now.

# I have 8500 shares at $20.98. And $100000 for 18 CALL, expire Dec18'26, waiting for the next year!!!; In for 1000 shares at $20.87. May nana’s blessings be in our favour.; Their foundry business no longer looks promising, they just canned the guy that was trying to get them to the same playing field as TSMC.

The best hope INTC can have is someone like QCOM buying them out, any other way for them seems like a slow death.; Im in only on bullshit astrology pattern recognition. Intc seems to bottom at 19 to 20 then after a few months pops to 25 before falling. In that time I can sell a ton of calls and make a modest 5% gain on top of selling at 25. Fuck it im in half my port lets go; Also any instability in the Taiwan strait would be good for Intel as grim as that is; even Nana would not fall for this shit again ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); U might want to add the fact that they are thinking about getting a new CEO. Anytime a big company gets a new CEO, company gets a clean slate and if he or she that comes aboard was successful prior, will bring some following with them and $$ as well; INTC does not have CPU technical leadership and it's not only about the process (their newest desktop stuff is inferior to AMD, even when both companies are using TSMC). They may still cling to a significant market share thanks to their shady lock-in sales tactics (as well as AMD's inability to manufacture enough CPUs for the server market), but that's not going to last forever.; Good analysis. Pat’s time as CEO was largely focused on the foundry business. There he made tremendous strides and as long as things follow through and intel executes with its foundry business, it could turn out very well. 

A lot of intels failings in the client market with raptor lake, arrow lake, and arc are a score spot. However, the average consumer has no clue about any of it. Most laptops still run Intel chips and most consumers are of the mindset, “core i7 good”, regardless of the fact that sku has a U suffix. They also still hold a strong lead in server due to a lot of that same legacy mind share. Really intels “mind share” has really only been demolished in the enthusiast space where people are privy to how shit intels products are compared to amd when it comes to power efficiency and value. 

I don’t see how Intel can catch up when it comes to product. They need a totally clean sheet for desktop on the cpu. I’m not holding my breath. 

AMD and TSMC have a partnership which has yielded significant advancements when it comes to advanced packaging. Things like Mi300 and 9800x3D are products that come to mind. Intel doesn’t have any real answer to this right now. If their foundry business is to succeed in the future they need to prove they can do these things at the same cost and scale as TSMC. Advanced packaging and chiplets are one of the next big things required to remain competitive in the space. Advanced packaging is essential for Intel foundry. 

Word is that Intel is in talks with some companies about a potential sale of parts of its business. Chances are they are gonna put in a ceo well atunes to that role. Whatever happens is anyone’s guess. A lot of names are being thrown around in regard to who may be buying part of the business. 

I’m holding my stock. Maybe I’ll break even one day.; Intel selling off CCG is suicidal, that's the only profitable part of the business!

Intel's big bet on 18A will likely succeed from a tech perspective. Pat said their BSPD is ahead of TSMC, and a former Samsung Foundry (now Intel employee) said Intel's GAA implementation is better than anyone else in the industry. They've poured billions into it, it'd better f\*cking work lol.

The problem is whether they can be a true foundry - have a robust process that can cater to the needs of different customer demands: desktop, datacenter, mobile, etc. They've only ever fabbed their own chips up to this point, and have just released their first ever PDK a few months ago. Would be nice to poach some experienced TSMC guys for this if possible.; > I think most analysts are forgetting that the next president is the same guy who is trying to block the acquisition of US steel by Nippon steel at all costs, regardless if it makes financial sense or not because he wants to retain as much American Manufacturing as possible and wants it to succeed.

I think this is a flawed assumption.  What he favors (historically) depends on who lines his pocket the most.  It would be wise to model the outcome with this possibility.; I came here because someone at yahoo finance turned your post into their own article lol ; NVDA is going to throw them a bone, or else QCOM is going to buy them; Buying Intel now is no bad idea; I just want a new CEO to be appointed for my calls to print.; Intel is prob the most rational valuation in the chips industry.. unfortunately, I believe the rest of the industry is extremely overvalued based on future growth... so ya.. Best to wait until intel actually does something good; $60 in 4 years is well within the realm. Like AMD, Intel will never go under or allowed to be bought out by a non-American company.

$20 will be our generational low.; I have over 83k worth of calls for late 2025 and early 2026. I don’t know anything. I’ve done very little dd. I’m trading mostly on vibes. What I’ve seen is Intel at $2 less then is being considered for buy out by every major player. So you’re telling me I can load up on shares or calls at $20.50 and if it goes down I get buy out rumors and all other news either is positive or putting me in buy out rumors range? Fuck it. Lock it in it’s a win for a trader about 95% guaranteed at this point. Happy to listen to as many people say it’s a boomer company with a shit culture and behind every company it competes with.; Intel was leader in the CPU market and still did shit as a stock. Now they are behind AMD. What do you think the stock will do? If its product does not get better, it is about to share the fate of Nokia and Yahoo. Once leaders, then losers.; The selling on Thursday looked like capitulation selling to me. I waited for the retest of those lows on Friday, they held, and I bought. I don’t know if this is the bottom, but the risk reward right now is very good. If I’m wrong I risk like 30 bucks for the relatively large position I took on Friday. It did close green on Friday, but there wasn’t a really hard bounce. So it’s possible sellers are still aggressive enough to drive it lower and keep it down there. We will see.; Thanks for your thoughtful analysis! I’m hopeful for a turnaround, too (10 6/26 45c.); If you like throwing good money after bad, just send it to me instead.; Bro wakes up every morning to spread misinformation; 😂 intc bag holder spotted. But seriously best of luck to you; 1.  Forget TSMC, try to beat Samsung first.
2. Forget about Samsung, try to produce some 20nm chip first.
Tsmc is at 2nm now.
3.  Tariff?  It only works if there is an alternative.  Americans have no choice but to buy from Taiwan.
4. Chip act, a big portion goes to INTC.  TSMC should stop making chips for INTC. 
5.  Better sell your INTC ASAP.; Give it a rest.; > Intel is competing with TSMC

Yeah, I am going to stop you right there. They are not. Neither on the technology side or customers.;

[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse); I think the board tried to shop Intel with how they handled CEO replacement. Todays price was flat indicating fair value; Intel probably won't disappear.

But not sure if they regain their dominance that soon or ever again.

Maybe top 10.

But now you have other fabless chip design companies ahead using TSMC and Samsung.

MRVL, QCOM, ARM, AVGO, AMD, NXPI, etc.

Maybe they will be like TXN, UMC and GF.; It is a shit company and nothing will change it! They lost all their advantage and now all they can do is line up their execs behind a wendy’s; You're a bagholder though....; It worries me that investor sentiment seems to be that Intel still has the lead on CPUs, because it means that AMD's crushing lead in the CPU space still somehow isn't priced in.; No way I'd buy Intel again.

Instead, they may require some cultural changes, like taking a more ""synthesis"" approach to tile, increasing the lifetime of sockets, etc.


Intel should have higher value running design-manufacturing duo, perhaps it can let foundry customers use some of its design too. E.g. Intel maintains a core focus on fast and efficient serial computes, but takes collaborative approaches on accelerators/parallel computes; Nana hopes you’re right.; So. Many. Words. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); This company gonna collapse, stop false hoping; Intels A18 yields are shit. So, no.; Please please please just buy $amd pleaseeeeeeeeeee $intc is sooooo garbage pleaeeeeeeee just listen, you know nothing and I want you to keep your money, get $amd pleaseeeeee, I’ll even hold your hand and buy it with you on Monday, I want to get the 2/21/25 150 call, will you buy just one for me 🥹; Didn't even read, just scrolled down to see nana; I am awaiting his post on December 8th.; “Papa’s home”; Fair move.; This is why I'm in Intel too, but maybe I'm a bit too early. I started buying LEAPS 45calls for June 2025 back in June of this year at an average cost of $0.51...and in September I bought a couple of August 2025 25 calls at $3.90 so I'm underwater on both at the moment.

I think the government won't let them fail, but I'm no longer convinced that the stock will move much. I was thinking that it would take just a bit of good news to push the stock, but it doesn't go up much on good news and the bad news keep piling up.

Probably won't add to this position until I see some sustained positive price action and might need to roll my 45c.; WTH $75?  Oh I forgot what subreddit I'm in.  Re.Tart.; Intel essentially needs a reason to exist.; Is the exit of Gelsinger a turning point moment?  Will it be like when Ballmer left Microsoft in favor of Satya Nadella?  Satya pivoted hard to cloud and changed the culture. 

Maybe the new INTC boss will pivot hard to Foundry and change the culture, resulting in a rebirth of growth in INTC similar to what MSFT enjoyed.; If I had that much, I'd be that much in too. I have 21 $35 Calls for Jan 2026, about $5000 of cost basis there. And I want to load up on more shares, so I got a bunch of calls going into next year. Intel currently represents about 60% of my portfolio, which is pretty much all the income I've made in late 2023 through 2024.; !remindme 2 years; Guess 20 was not the bottom ; What's with people thinking companies can buy INTC? Yes the market cap is low and looks attractive but the reality is Intel would be very very expensive to own.  North of $500bn guaranteed considering they have $200bn of assets alone.; Are you referring to the recent 10% yield article? That's been debunked.; Any instability in that regard would be bad for the entire set of chip stocks though; I don’t think it’ll get that bad. Losing Taiwan to China would be a complete blow to his administration.; Why would China do this?

After all, that's really the point of tariffs, not to collect revenue but to change behavior.; Well it's the only profitable part so far. But as TSMC is proof of, you can just do foundry, you don't need to have design. And if there is a demand for an American Cutting Edge Foundry, Intel is the only one that could fill that spot. This is what people are not understanding, the 2025 landscape is going to change in many ways.; I saw, and they changed a lot of the wording. Just to be clear, Intel is only still relevant because they have the majority market share in CPUs, that is almost 54% of revenue.; Nvidia makes AI datacenters, not video game GPUs. It's a paradigm shift.

Intel can barely make a CPU today, their actual bread and butter; And what will happen to the stock if they buy them?; Going to bonertown baby brother.; This.

|-|-|-|-|; Added 3000 shares today!\~; That 10% yield article is a rehash of an old article from a long time ago. It was 10% then, we don't have the latest yield numbers but it is pretty much guaranteed to be way higher than that.

Having said that, yield percentage comparison is not a proper way of measurement. The real comparison is defect density; idk about “debunked” so much as “disregarded” because of potential conflict of interest. 

but i think he was just referring to how bad a sign firing pat is for IFS. made me sell — just cannot fathom how that was the right play unless 1) 18A is going to shit behind the scenes 2) pat is sick or something; That would make the stock move.; Lmao; True. They still need to remain competitive though. People will probably pay more if the product is superior. That’s why it’s important the foundry follows through and continues advancing nodes and packaging.; Yes you do need design, Intel's CCG business still does more revenue than all of QCOM combined. By itself, ignoring foundry losses, it's probably worth $50-60/share.

TSMC has had years and years of experience being a pure foundry. Intel has not, so even if the 18A node itself is successful from a technical perspective, they have yet to prove it can meet the needs of external customers. 

It is the right strategy to have a foundry in the US, but Intel's execution has been poor for years. They would need to execute on Foundry better than they've ever done before, while maintaining CCG profits, to have the runway needed for this turnaround play.; Intel just sold like $150 million worth of CPUs for XAI’s new data center; They make datacenters now? I guess that RTX 4070 I bought last year was made by AMD then...; Intel appears to be competing against Apple’s ARM Silicon chips since Apple is primarily an OS company but that’s as far as they go.; 18.50 was the lows from the earnings dump? Hmmm I might have fucked this up.; Whatever buyer or spin off entity would be using the fab. The trapped customer is still there.; Reputation is very important. Intel Graphics products are actually quite good.
See if they can work out reasonable Arrow Lake fixes with partners; I also wouldn't say that rehabilitation is needed. They need to deliver the innovation and quality of products similar to or better than early Core era 


I.e. Everything can be done can be outdone ; Sir, this is a Wendy’s.; I am not swinging on the intel trade until I see a clear path to a competently high yield production of 18a.; Even though I am also bullish on Intel long term, you have to bear in mind that a government takeover/bailout can mean shareholders being wiped out. When GM got bailed out by the government, the stock went to zero, and shareholders lost their equity completely. Government incentive to keep a company alive is not always a plus for investors.; Why did you think they wouldn't let a discount airline fail? Boeing, on the other hand, they won't let fail either which is why I'm in Boeing too. Up on shares, down on options though ![img](emote|t5_2th52|18630); lol  more accurate? lol; I think the old Intel would never happen. It has to be a new Intel. They've already ditched the dividend, reduced headcount. The leadership is the issue. The tech is definitely there.; It’s been debunked. Pat Gelsinger himself responded to it on Twitter; It's just useless without talking about size as well. I can say for a fact TSMC has a 10% yield as well. Because at a big enough die size TSMC fabs will have a 90% defect rate.


It's really easy to make the fab sound bad to the people who have little idea of what's actually going on.; Yeah my assumption is that they stick to the foundry roadmap. I'm not expecting 18A to be perfect but I think given that it is smaller than 2nm, it can end up being more effective even if yields are lower. On packaging, I believe Intel has a site in New Mexico but also plants elsewhere, Malaysia too I think.; Missing the point. CPUs are a component. Nvidia is the one selling the entire system that works together that is the paradigm shift.

The CPU, GPU, NvLink, HBM etc. ofc there are many players involved but it's an Nvidia product at the end of the day. They make the sale.; It was the low when it redipped in September.; Rehabilitation of the image that Intel has had for the past decade or so.; Because the blocked the jet blue merger. Which set up up to file bankruptcy frontier was there only hope and that didn’t go anywhere… rip saveq it’s actually going back up tho surprisingly; ""The tech is definitely there.""

lold; … yeah it’s likely gonna go lower then. Oooops; I would say it’s about honestly recognizing mistakes, learning , and moving on; Yeah, sure...they essentially forced Spirit into bankruptcy but I don't see how any of those airlines are important enough to the US government to be worth saving.; Are they not one of the few companies who can actually manufacture below 3nm?; While I don’t see INTC filing bankruptcy I don’t see government leaning towards INTc just based off
”American made”  SMCI and Nvidia are already setting up shop here in USA…; Thats to be seen whether they can actually manufacture below 3nm...

"COVID as a Mini ""Lost Decade""","By overlaying earnings and market cap we can get a pretty rough story of what happened with COVID and money printing and interest rate hikes and what this means for the future.

This image below is a bunch of large companies that represent the SPY. The colored areas are their earnings (with their predicted earnings in a lighter shade) and the black line is their combined market cap (price).

[https://imgur.com/a/GoOoF02](https://imgur.com/a/GoOoF02)  
I've annotated a few arrows to explain what seems to have roughly happened.

**Orange Arrow 2020 - 2022:** Interest rates drop which causes excess liquidity to flood the market. Those who already had assets saw huge portfolio increases. This new wealth combined with low interest caused a housing price boom. New money in the hands of retail caused cults to form around memes like GME. Plus no one wants to work and is wfh.

**Red Arrow 2022:** A ""lost decade"" is a period of time where new investors have no access to good investments. People who just started working in 2022 or decided to start investing in 2022 had no good place to put their money and would only have broken even in 2024. (the horizontal dash). In a larger crisis like with Japan's lost decade(s) you have 10-20 years where the stock market effectively grinds sideways. 

**Red & Orange**

[https://imgur.com/a/FD8zYAb](https://imgur.com/a/FD8zYAb)

If you overlay the SPY with the Fed's interest rate policy you can see that it looks to have caused some temporary price distress but long term the price is correlated with earnings, not interest rate.  A ""lost decade"" is effectively exuberance that ""pulls forward"" price appreciation and ""steals"" it from future investors. 

In the COVID response, those who had assets in 2020 benefited while those who started investing in 2022 had a difficult time b/c they didn't have access to the exponential growth of markets.

**Blue Line**

Long term investors who think in decades and don't actually need large purchases like cars or weddings (like old people...) can just ignore these bumps and focus on long term earnings.

\---

The above is obviously over-simplified but it's an example of how using earnings and price in tandem allows you to see the underlying story behind price movement.

If you just focus on price, all you can do is draw a line up and the right and say things that are true like ""AAPL is a good company""

You have no perspective.

The worst example is someone who got scared of investing in stocks in 2020 but seeing everyone around him get rich for 2 years he decides to start investing in 2022 and loses money for two years and decides to stop and then starts watching everyone around him make more money... in a never-ending spiral of 2 year delayed FOMO.

It's like relying on a tourist pamphlet in a foreign city. If you can't make a judgement of quality independently then you will always pay high prices and wait in long lines.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h8fr0c/covid_as_a_mini_lost_decade/,0,2024-12-07 01:10:51,
Roth vs Trad Vanguard / Confirmation,"Hey everyone. Yet another Traditional vs Roth question so thanks for bearing with me. I believe I received conflicting info from the Vanguard rep over the phone earlier in the year and, even after reading link after link, I want to get clarification since I missed one pivotal piece. 

Background:
Household makes 250k a year
Have a Roth Account.
Have a Traditional IRA. 
Contribute 7k+ per year into a Traditional IRA and then convert that to a Roth each year (?) 

My question:
Vanguard told me to contribute each month to my Traditional Ira and then at the start of the year I “convert it” to my Roth IRA. Is that right? That’s not the Backdoor Roth but does that matter?

Also, if I contribute more than the 7k in the traditional IRA, I can only “convert” 7k of that to the Roth, and leave any overage in the Traditional with the stocks I have set?

Apologies for redundancy but I would like to be set I won’t have any IRS surprises in the future. 

Thanks all. 
",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h8c3dd/roth_vs_trad_vanguard_confirmation/,1,2024-12-06 22:21:22,"I think what you are describing is back door Roth IRA conversion . Since your income is over the limit of 130k single ( approximately ) you have to do “ backdoor Roth IRA “ conversion . It’s just a strange odd thing we have to do . Unlike  a regular person who makes let’s say 50 k a year , who can just contribute 7000 directly into their Roth IRA , us the “ rich” people have to go through the “ back door” … so you have to contribute 7000 to Traditional Ira , wait a day or 2 fir it to settle , then click on  that account again and say “ convert to Roth IRA” . It’s looks and feels kind of stupid I think , but that’s the rules lol .; You can't contribute more than 7k into an IRA unless you are over 50, in which case you can contribute 8k per year. You cannot leave any excess contributions in any IRA if you have reached the limit, otherwise you will be forced to take it out.; You don't have to contribute over months. Most people contribute and convert all within the first week of January. If you're doing it for the first time then just max it out today.; Also , once you have your Roth IRA ( it just basically a set up that allows you to not pay tax on whatever that money grows into ) you buy whatever you want in it . Individual stocks, bonds , index funds , etc; Thank you. That’s good to know in general as it’ll probably kick back the funds. What account would I be able to open to freely contribute to and invest in let’s say VOO or SCHD? A standard brokerage?; Personal standard brokerage account, but you don't have any tax deferral or prepay advantages with that.

Max out tax advantaged accounts first like IRA/401k as you currently are, with a priority on ROTH, and anything above the annual limit that's still investable, you can go into personal standard brokerage or non-qualified account types."
Keep AAPL or pay federal student loans?,"I’ve held a decent chunk apple since 2018, and it’s enough to cover my student loans from this year that accrue at 9% interest (insane, I understand.) 
is there merit to continuing to hold apple? I’m not sure if I believe that apple will continue to outperform the 9% at which my loans accrue interest. Any input would be appreciated!

I would probably bite the bullet and pay off the loan, especially after this banner year of market performance.; At 9% id sell and pay down the debt.  Guaranteed 9% return is hella solid and you free up cash flow for more investment; I'd pay off the loans.  Guaranteed 9% return is not to be sneered at. Especially with current market valuations.; Pay off the loan and then DCA back into AAPL with however much you were paying on your loan; Pay off the loans. Today.; Absolutely pay off 9% loans; psychologically, it will help you tremendously to pay off all debts.  I would prioritize paying debts first.  

even if you are not bothered by it right now, having debts will give you second thoughts about making other large purchases.; ""I’ve held a decent chunk apple since 2018"" I can see you have faith in AAPL. Paying off student loan wont disappoint you.; Always pay down your debt. Debt interest compounds against you and nothing is more powerful than compound interest. Why would you want it working against you?; You get apples current premium valuation plus 9% on top, yeah I'd cash it; at 9% interest it would likely be worth it to pay it off. I wouldn't let go of AAPL fully tho; I sold some of my appl at $233 to pay down my %7.785 mortgage.. rest I reshift to high beta stocks. And I don’t regret it at all. 

I also bought my iphone 16 pro at the store and the traffic isn’t too great. I think apple will have some growth plateau and it’s worth the sale; How much of your portfolio is in apps and how much gains do you have embedded in it?

At a general level you want to be aware of the tax costs to selling. It often can make more sense to sell shares in things you recently bought over selling shares in long term holdings that will generate a big tax hit.; I just don’t understand why AAPL should be trading at 30+ forward P/E with very modest earnings growth…can someone help me?; Could also consider diversifying, you don't really need to keep just apple, nor pay off all debt at once.; +1, and the emotional relief of not having debt is a great added bonus, especially with constant waves of layoffs right now; This is kind of my general thought as well. The market did so well that I may as well take advantage of it, but AAPL will always be valuable. 

To the others’ point, the debt going away would be comforting to say the least.; I completely agree. Right now, I'd probably feel safe sitting on loans in the 4-6% area, but 9 is just wild. Definitely focus on paying the loans down first.; Right. 9% is crazy, sadly.; It’s about 10% of my portfolio and sitting around 200% gain.; Why is Costco at PE of 60??; Also, paying loans is tax free. Stocks not so much.; If it's 10% of your portfolio, do you have any losers you can sell? Get the tax benefit of a capital loss this time of year, and free up some cash to pay the loan.; Do you have any other holdings held at a loss or only minor gain? I personally would only sell holdings with a 200% gain if they were a massive over-allocation or I really needed the money and there was no alternative. Given apple's size, 10% is not a crazy overweight. 

Another thing to consider ifs what the specific tax cost would be. If you are in a low tax state, it would be easier to justify than if you were in CA for example.; Why do stocks have any value at all, especially ones without dividends?  All perception I suppose.; This is a good idea. I’ll take a closer look at some of my worse performing picks."
"r/Stocks Daily Discussion & Fundamentals Friday Dec 06, 2024","This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on fundamentals, but if fundamentals aren't your thing then just ignore the theme.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Better than expected nonfarm with expected unemployment.

They're gonna name a building in DC after JPow when this is all said and done.; With lv you're investing in china, not europe; I hopped out at $120 but thinking about getting back in; There was a class action lawsuit that (somewhat correctly imo) pointed out that management was not upfront about Pepsi overordering in 2023 and misrepresented the success of the business. So there's some negative sentiment there. But I do believe the worst is behind us. There's a strong floor at $25. Just sucks that I have a lot of money tied up in this stock while everything else is pumping. But nothing is going to change materially until next earnings report when they can actually put a number on it and say Pepsi is starting to order more.; I don’t get it, doesn’t move on positive news and dumps on anything else; 60 PE for a fucking retailer.

insert meme of Kitty throwing the intelligent investor book in the trash; Bought my first shares in it at the end of 2020. Continued to invest in it this year. Have 14.3 shares in it atm, just hoping it continues to flourish.; Wonder if it was because it was expected to be added. Sp500?; I think if you put a COST like multiple on AMZN retail and a proper tech multiple on AWS, and so on, the sum of the parts value would be substantially higher today. The stagnant price is perfect for people like me who weren't able to buy / didn't bother in 2022-3.

Plus market is probably sleeping on Anthropic.; I bought it april 2020 and almost anything else has outperformed; Amazon is a funny company.  It's consumer cyclical and tech.  Its a strong time of year to own both.

Congratulation on your investing.; Is absolutely crushing it

8.7% for the week.; Im at Google 9%, Meta 8%, AMZN 7%, then it falls off to the <5.5%; inflation down? we've consistently got hotter than expected readings in the last few months. and what happens when apartment supply actually dries up by next year?; It just keeps going. Im a little sad I sold half for profits but still have some skin on the game.; The technicals on META and teck in general are very very strong.; Delusion or new paradigm; Im starting to go with Tom Lee. It is better to be a perma bull then worry about corrections. I made way more money buying and going long in stocks than panic selling once the stock hit a 52 week high or shorting.; [deleted]; Once you accept that the US system is intentionally set up to benefit people owning assets and devalue the dollar/ workers' earned income it's easier to reorient your thinking and planning. Real estate, stocks, businesses. Own those and you'll be moving with the tide instead of against it like you'd be relying fully on earned income and saving cash.

It's not my preferred world but it's what we're dealing with.; QE distorted the shit out of our economy. If you don’t own assets, you’re feeling the sting of that printing. 

The K shape recovery couldn’t be more obvious yet few seem to realize what happened. It seems like finance people are literally the only ones who understand what’s happening. ; It is quite insane asset owners can gain more value in a day than a basic worker will make in a few lifetimes, esp if you look at other countries.; Not every one is financial literate. Just look at those Caleb Hammer videos.

One of the first steps to investing is just not living pay check to pay check to be able to risk your extra money in the market. But unfortunately not a lot of people have extra money.; Its also the wonder of compounding.  The more you save and invest, the more you make exponentially.  Rich people have the luxury to save more, invest more - and the income disparity will grow regardless of how much the government will try to stop it.  It becomes a feedback loop.

Look at the difference of one who puts in 200$ bucks a month vs another with $400 invested in a 30 year time frame.; I haven't doubled yet; I don't make much, but put everything I have in stocks. I don't care if it goes down, I'll never be rich anyways. I just want the chance of it going up; Great buying opportunity if you're looking for an entry imo. There's an endless supply of suits behind Brian that will fill his spot and it will be business as usual. The guy isn't even the CEO of the overall company UHG.; XLV has been in free fall since October. Health care is underperforming across the board.; Who knows what could be uncovered behind the shooting. Market hates uncertainty more than anything; Literally dragged me into the red today lol. AMD truly is team red; Not owning tech, what a miss; Go all in bro, party like it's 2021; People long the likes of GOOG and AMZN should cream themselves if we get another 2022.; Nostradamus; There were plenty of people wanting to buy it on here. Also lots of I don't knows. Also a lot of people who hated it. 

How do you pick which one is the consensus of the sub?; Yup! Glad I kept buying (avg price of $307). ; I saw the vision at around $250. I thought it could keep sinking to $200 for a cigar butt deal. LMAO that was a terrible decision in hindsight.; Upvotes are what is popular in the current 24 hours. So if a stock is down people will trash it. If a stock is too high people will go it is overvalued and get upvotes. With the second example this can easily cost people money as well if they sell the stock too early thinking it overvalued an it keeps going up.; “This sub was wrong”

What else is new.; you basically described the stock market since the 08 recession; The only question is mid or late January.  

The cycles are behaving normally so far.; Trigger finger ready on SVIX when VIX jumps; Bull? They lagged the entire year; Amazon would like a word; I'm rdunk today and going all in fraind!  YEEEEE HAAAAWWWW!!!  Haven't even looked at it.; Maybe i missed the boat on that but there’s no way i can buy it now, the market cap is bigger than some airlines; UNH probably down in particular because it put a giant spotlight on their egregious denial rates during many people's health insurance open season.; The timing is certainly curious. Those other companies have been on a downtrend since Sept. UNH has been flat. Now it's dropped 10% in two days. That just does not happen to this stock outside of some big news. That big news is kinda obvious.; It's def bad pr related to how many people are happy their ceo got offed in broad daylight. Maybe a crwd like buying opportunity though; It's very clearly because of the news.; Market expects corporate tax cuts, lower regulations, and no significant tariffs. None of these are guaranteed. Corporate/Cap gains tax cuts especially rely on a 1-3 member GOP majority in the House. I've heard the phrase ""Buy the election and sell the inauguration"" for this year- regardless of that I'm expecting things to waver next year. Right now all the bullish business hopes are being priced in before the actual fighting to enact them begins.; The market is still overpricing the long term inflationary risk of trump tariffs. I continue to see yields going down, causing HYSA to return less. I think 2025 will still be good for stocks, but not as great as 2024 so I would continue to buy noteable dips but get ready for increased volatility. If you can stomach it, you can still make 15%-20% upside; HYSA will likely have less interest going forward.

I thought that was a part of the current rally. People were taking cash out those savings to do opposite and buy stocks.; I'd just stock pick if you're getting detailed enough that you're targeting subsectors. SMH has a higher proportion of foundry and equipment holdings than SOXX if you want to diversify.; SMHX has only fabless companies in their ETF so Cadence and Synopsys, but they also hold Astera labs and Nvidia, its kinda hard to find something that doesn’t have Nvidia in it, 

I’m about to load up on ASML though, there’s a bit of a negative stigma around it right now and that only makes me more bullish towards it. That company has such strong fundamentals, anybody acting like those machines are going to fade into irrelevancy are delusional imo.; Only reason I can think of, is some sort of legislation against META to protect young girls or something. Because of Instagram. Basically some sort of regulation or fine that could affect their business model slightly; If shadow president decides to gut punch meta?; Look at the amount they are buying, it's exposure. It's not even a rounding error for them.; They know when to but and when to sell, and are always happy to sell calls when IV spikes; What is good value for calls? You mean low IV?; MSFT Jan monthly calls have IV under 20%. Expecting it to play catch up.; AMD; WMT; Never buy puts against the trend. Wait until there is a clear negative catalyst and then scalp the movement. You don’t need to call the absolute top.; Tsla is a corruption stock, the whole ridiculous valuation is betting on it being an oligarch stock now. Trying to bet against that may not be the best move. 

If it was under any other circumstance then it may have been a good move.; I wouldn't do it unless it's a hedge. They want to push this to 400.; I was considering it, but 12/20 seems too soon imo; [deleted]; Why would anyone buy puts on tsla right now?; Buy calls instead of puts.; Bump; Yes; Yes.

It might work from time to time, but stay away from shorting this thing until you get more clear signs outside of speculation about personalities not clashing (which many have had), that Elon is going to have a fall out with Trump.

Frankly at this point, I think $500ish comes by February of next year. This thing can run THAT HOT when it's on absolute fire off call options and as I said...it might as well be Vice President Musk.; He's not gonna give you a cabinet post bro

Actually...he might, if you keep those compliments coming; Did you forget the trade war up and down cycle we had to live through; I prefer MNDY as a stock, but ofc asan is 3x cheaper on price/sales basis so if your right it could run nicely to match the higher valuations; If AMD is too expensive then it'll be hard to justify stocks like PLTR, TSLA, etc; That means at some point the trend will reverse and begin going upwards if they're *actually* making good progress and start eating up more market share. I own some - not *displeased* with it, but I also would enjoy if it continued going up.; GEO is the big one, I don't hold it due to my own moral misgivings with the company but it went up 50% the day after the election was called.; I know. It's annoying because there's very little incentive to do risk management on the sell-side, which instead falls upon the shoulders of people like me.; Nah sell AFTER the sp500 inclusion.; I'm cutting my stake down to 50% from 66% on Monday. As a rule of thumb, I don't interfere with momentum and there's too much institutional support behind APP for it to collapse. However, the expectations for the e-commerce vertical are getting too high.; thanks, didnt know about those; I think you have to ask yourself if it’s worth the work/risk required to beat the index. Is it even possible to work hard enough to beat it? I think it’s mostly luck and partly hard work, whereas getting a high paying job is partly luck and mostly hard work. If 99% of people can’t beat the index and it requires 0 work it’s a no brainer; Very nice, I would rather be early and avg down than miss a big move; I do. I should diversify, but I mean...; David Rosenberg just straight up said on Twitter that this rally is justified. That in itself signifies a top must be near; Yea time will tell. Uber seems like a stock where the answer wont be known for 1-2 years. Problem is people dont like to wait. They dont like uncertainty.; What growth scenario can you possibly scribble out that can make up for this unholy enterprise value. We are talking about $0.04 of quarterly operating income on a $75 share price. ; Concerning. You've got a chart?; 2m is nothing, that OF lady gets 45m a year from her simps; Just makes BTC that much more bullish; Wtf? People still fall for those? Are NFTs making a comeback?; Normally, very little. Right now I'm 60/40 roughly though; It was a situation of a headline without an article. I bought asked questions later. With more info it seems a Senator isn't happy DKNG/FLUT control 90% of the market.

So it seems like if true isnt that good for DKNG/FLUT to control that much market share. If not and DKNG/FLUT can make the case they have no moat which many on this sub and market may already believe then the case goes nowhere.; Indeed

Well let’s see where this loosening cycle ends up…; I haven't done much DD into it. Is the current price worth entering?; This book is 75 years old, and probably not that relevant anymore. Since then we've had the internet, bots that trade on technical analysis, 16 year old kids with RobinHood app on their smartphones, tons of influencers on IG and TT causing tens of millions of people to FOMO into the market...

Today's market is night and day different. You shouldn't analyze it by the same standards. This is why at the moment I use basic TA purely; That was my speculative guess.; Applying a COST like multiple on anything is kinda crazy lol. It's a unicorn in terms of premium. But I agree there's a lot of good things in AMZN's pipeline in the next 5-10 years. I would buy but my wife works there and has held on to all her RSUs and has destroyed me in the market as I sweat and check daily charts and waste away hours lmao.; Yea META has outperformed the last few years, but not going to sell it; I remember when everyone said it was tanking when it hit $98 months ago. I despise FB, but damn what a comeback; I keep hoping for a split.; I'm a pretty consistent perma-bull myself but valuations are getting hard to ignore.  Not a bad time to take some profits off the table and/or diversify away from sectors which are overheating.; panic selling is NEVER a good idea

Before you buy any stock, you have to make a decision if it's in bucket A or bucket B.

Bucket A = Ride or Die. Longterm mindset. You only sell if there's a material change to your original purchase thesis

Bucket B = Not Ride or Die, so you have a stop loss and you've already made yourself comfortable with a specific maximum loss amount. You have more of a swing trade mindset

Bucket A = Marriage

Bucket B = Fling; Always loved this Lynch quote:

*“Far more money has been lost by investors in preparing for corrections, or anticipating corrections, than has been lost in the corrections themselves.”*; Buy high, sell higher!; US bull market is strongest in innovation assets and American institutions buying more crypto under trump, while most foreign countries’ bull market are on housing, workers across the world are benefiting from quality of life improvement at the very least when innovation investment boom.; Not just the US, I'd argue the UK is worse. At least you have plenty of land over there.; [deleted]; Yes, that is the crux of my poorly framed comment. I'm the only one really in my friend and family circle that has grasped what happened during the pandemic money printing bonanza (and to a large degree what has been happening since 2008) and it's like I'm living in a completely separate reality.; Yeah, that's partly why I wrote the comment. They're losing endless amounts of money to inflation. If you look at average wages here in the UK and average market returns since the pandemic, such people have probably effectively lost more money than they've earned.; Yet under capitalism wealth generated usually lasts 2 or 3 generations. Under more centrally controlled economies there is typically a lot less social mobility within families.; UNH was doing really well until yesterday; lol you guys are always the sellers at bottoms. What are you even talking about?; Shoulda bet on team green; Right. Seems like he already knows the solution.; Oh my bro, so sorry, i buy today at 7.50; If the market was so easy why do we fluctuate from fear to greed, risk off to risk on so quickly? Everyone is all gangster and gung ho until they get tested; yes, we will never have a pullback and these companies will keep going up forever, even with forward pe's of 200. 

this time is different huh?; There are also the people who are silent when a stock is down and then pop up once the stock goes up 10-30% to go I bought when it was down.; since the era of Central Banks just adding infinite liquidity and preventing red.

How much worse can income inequality get before theres a worldwide crisis. This is bonkers; Perfect; Short?; Even more reason to be bullish on it.  I LOVE It when a good business lags with a low PE ratio.  

Amazon is soaring right now, hang onto that.; Yup.

UNH had been the strongest health insurance stock, it was 2.3% from its ATH before the last couple days had sent it down 10%.; Honestly, it's going to be an SOB and a half for much at all to occur outside of reconciliation to try to extend TCJA and cut the chips act and infrastructure bill.

Not sure you get a further tax cut. 

Anyway, yeah, anything more by the S&P to close 2024 just continues to decrease the possibility of a 2017 replay, which looks like it was low volatility and a 20%ish increase on the year. More likely that this year gets skipped if we're going to attempt to just directly compare to Trump's first term.; yes i am aware

but it is prudent to trim my positions

take some profits

and de-risk a little; im currently getting 4.75% APY on my HYSA  
but im aware that will lower esp with the Fed cutting rates; No way, Zuck already kissed the ring.; Some put leaps wouldn't be a bad idea.; I’m not super well versed. Can you elaborate a bit please; Thanks for the insight. So just let it’s do its thing rn right? Also Tesla ITM calls and puts are insanely expensive 💀; Not planning to short , just buying regular puts. Shorting is way too risky; Cause running on hype rn, a single bad news will cause a pullback like last time; Oh I’m not shorting, just buying normal puts 🫡; Wouldn’t be surprised to see $500 too, but if and when it falls. It falls HARD. It fell from $180 to $110 in less than a month in 2022; how long until it hits $150?; I agree, I don't own any of those; There's nothing wrong with not putting in the work and accepting s&p returns. But if you can beat it significantly? And all it requires is to read and click a button to buy? That's easy work, I wouldn't even call work since it's a hobby of mine to keep up with business news. Maybe I wouldnt suggest it to everyone. But if you're someone who loves to obsess about something, obsessing about stocks puts you in the higher percentile of investors. Because a huge amount of investors do no research and buy what they like, based on nothing but sentiment. Or get shares from work, or inherit shares. There's so many subsets of investors that are working with less tools than I am, that drag down the percentage of people who would be successful. Thinking about all the people who invest who are at a heavy disadvantage, makes me more confident that I could maybe be in that 1% of people. I could be wrong. But so far the risk has paid off. That's not to say it always will. But I like the chance to try, and learn while I go; Uber is very interesting here, not sure I want to hold it through all the news stories that are going to move it but I think waymo partnering with them is meaningful, if Google doesnt want full verticalization then the main AV bear case for Uber seems overblown by a lot; The secular cycle is roughly [65 months](https://imgur.com/YvjBa5v) and reflects the debt turnover cycle.; I guess the publicity works seeing as you believe it.; You're YTD like 50%+ and 40% international?? That's genuinely crazy. Though for me international = index funds only, while I'm guessing you bottom ticked some Chinese tickers...; Yes imo this is a great entry for the next 3-5 years but you have to have patience. This is not a tech stock. They're moving physical product in a very competitive market with basically no moat beyond customer preference. International expansion is still early days but everything is pointing to it going well. It's popular amongst genz and more importantly women. They're expanding the market not just stealing share from Redbull & Monster. Downside is leadership does not seem to care about shareholders at all. They are just focusing on executing their playbook and look at the stock price as noise. But from every angle this stock is undervalued. The only thing that can go wrong from here is if they fuck up international or all of a sudden a new energy drink comes and dethrones them from the #3 spot.; Yeah I was exaggerating, I think it's undervalued even if you give it a premium like WMT or something too.; Months ago, try years ago.

That was 2022.

It had craters in November but was back almost to $200 a share by February.

Had it not been for the pandemic I might have panicked and sold.

Really glad I didn't.; Taking profits is a taxable event. I also dont want to be in a situation where I take profits creating that taxable even like take profit on META at $400 for the stock to keep going up.; I mean, that quote is intended for investors holding broad market index funds, not people YOLO'ing PLTR, NVDA and BTC with 100% of their portfolio; Personally, I invest because I have to, not because I have an ideological loyalty to how things work right now with all the details and processes that go along with that. Today's version of capitalism has put the costs of negative externalities on the vast majority of citizens to favor a small amount of owners to an unacceptable degree in my opinion, and increased automation is only going to make wealth inequality and the effects that we're already seeing with this K shaped economy much more severe. So as long as the system is set up this way, I think I need to get on the same train that Bezos is on. 

If things changed where labor had more power, capital gains were taxed closer to earned income, and there weren't huge tax incentives and loopholes for asset ownership I'd adjust my strategy.; It's maddening and quite disheartening. I think we're witnessing the greatest wealth transfer in history, and almost no one is aware of what's going on. It seems like no matter their political leanings, what's been happening completely flies over the heads of most people.

I'm worried where this is all heading. Inequality is already horrendous and if anything, appears to be accelerating. If you don't hold assets, you've fallen behind and I think are likely to only fall further behind going forward. Then when the next recession arrives, we'll print our way out of it and rob the working class even more. Rinse and repeat.; I just visited the UK (London) recently. What's insane is that the cost of living there is similar to the most expensive cities in the US but the wages are like... Indiana, US. Add on terrible stock returns, and basically the only people with wealth are those who inherited it. 

On a side note, whenever I read a comment like yours above, it's almost always the case that poster is from Canada or the UK. A decade of GDP per capita being stagnant  takes its toll.; I sold small amounts of UNH at profit yesterday and bought puts today. If it Vs I can buy back at a discount; Some people just don't want to be rich; I just watched my largest holding in ASML drop from a high of nearly $1,100 go all the way down to $650 after short term guidance shifted. I was buying at under $600 when I went in deep. It made up over 25% of my holdings at one point. That's just a recent test. People who are truly holding long understand the fundamentals of the businesses they hold, and short term fluctuations of market price create opportunities.

I didn't sell one share as it climbed or decreased, then I nibbled as the stock approached a very enticing valuation once again.; It depends on the individual company. None of mine have pe over 60 I don't think, as if that were the only thing to consider anyways. Id have to check again. But, markets trend up over time.; Yes usually VIX has a massive recovery after a spike, for example August 5th of this year.  
When VIX spiked SVIX went to 19$, and within less than two weeks was 32$, about 68%, in and out.; low PE ratio? It's quite expensive relative to it's 10-15 year valuation.; If you're trading nothing wrong with that. Personally I'm pulling back on the amount I'm DCAing and building some saved cash before next year.; It is a good place to park money not invested. But dont expect to get life changing money off your savings account.; But did he lick the taint; just go with momentum, at least till January, not a financial advice; He thinks this simple strategy is a good way to time the market; People have been saying this about $tsla since it IPO’d and it is still exceeding ATHs.

I’m no bandwagon for any stock but you could probably invest those puts in a less riskier play.; After a 4 for 1 split.; The Uber analyst defense force has been in full swing last couple of days. One bull case from their talking heads is all you need is for Waymo to not be a monopoly. If one other company makes AV work that increases the odds of Uber being the aggregator.; Thanks!; I wasnt 40% international most of the year, I did get lucky in some china names (should have held a little longer though) but most of my YTD gains was USA speculative names I have now sold and moved the winnings over to more value/garp; There's a lot of EX-US companies doing well this year. MELI, NU, CSU, ADYEN, SE....; Wait are you guys saying allocation 40% or 40+% gains YTD, I think op is saying the former.; Oh shit ya I must have been in a coma. That didn’t seem like that long ago. Either way, it’s come way back up since. Facebook is just a behemoth of the social networks; [deleted]; As you said - many don't realise. 

I grew up pretty poor and most of my close family are still poor, including my parents who are still working full-time in what should be their retirement years. I've done fairly well for myself, but not really well enough to help them out, and even if I could, they would not accept it.

They don't understand what has happened. Like most of the British working class, they don't pay much attention to economics and are pretty financially illiterate. Neither of them finished school to boot, as my mum dropped out of school due to getting pregnant and my dad left early to work on a farm.

My brother is in a not too dissimilar position - living in a council house, and he's just been in a bad accident a few years ago that has messed him up and prevented him working since. He has 3 kids and they're all doomed to the cycle with nothing bequeathed.

Disheartening is probably right, but when I think about it too much I think it's a bit of an understatement.

They are all and have been the embodiment of sisyphus - pushing the boulder up the hill to provide for themselves and their children, all the meanwhile destroying their bodies and losing their precious time on earth - and the inflation has been pushing the boulder right back down.; Yeah, our wages are terrible. I could earn 4 or 5 times what I do if I lived in the US as a software engineer. I'm a net contributor here as well, which is actually rare given you need to be on around £50k just to be contributing more to the state that it's currently spending per head, bearing in mind the average wage is just under £40k. And things only look set to get worse. I should probably look at leaving.; This totally checks out; I'm 35% YTD no tech with a portfolio that has half the risk ; Well, I'm pretty bearish so I'm hoping we won't have a ""massive recovery"" after the spike.

This is a bubble of gigantic proportions. I see VIX going a little lower and then a big spike soon, and hopefully no recovery for the foreseeable future. I'd love to snatch some META at 300.; Ancient history, different business.; Yeah lol this is wild low PE lol; I thought expecting life changing money was the quickest way to go broke in the stock market?

I have enough in my HYS to replace my roof, as I add more I will consider moving some of it elsewhere, but 4.75% isn't terrible.; [deleted]; Ahh so wait until January? NFA?; Yea it exceeds ATH in the long run but short term, money can be made imo. and you mean invest those puts in a different stock?; OP said in a different comment yesterday 50% YTD, the 40% is allocation. Gotta keep up with the /r/stocks lore mate!; I think publicly traded companies are by and large a great thing, they're accessible for the public to participate, they have stringent reporting and transparency requirements to protect investors from malfeasance, and they're liquid to help the companies grow and improve which has helped support our economy. It has a lot of good, but it also leads to some negative situations when certain services and businesses end up chasing profit growth over providing quality service such as health insurance companies or prisons or certain utilities. This gets especially bad when an industry is predisposed to monopoly. The profit motive, especially the one pushed by the publicly traded stock system, can lead to worse outcomes for society when applied to things that probably should not be solely incentivized via profit motive. Still, I think having a robust publicly traded credit system is much better than an all private equity system.

Interestingly there is a big shift back to private credit markets that are more closely gate-kept, so even the credit markets are becoming less democratic and transparent lately. This, to me, could be another long term threat to class mobility.

As for taxes, I think income and long term cap gains rates should be closer and loopholes that allow things like Elon Musk leveraging stocks to buy a company with no cap gains tax should be dialed down. I don't think investment returns should be incentivized so heavily over direct pay for work/salary. Maybe reduce income taxes a bit and raise long term cap gains imo.; One must imagine sisyphus happy. It really is the only way not to be crushed under the reality of it.; Most of the US is a terrible place to live however, a giant generic non walkable suburb, with some exceptions. But those exceptions don't hold a handle to European cities.

If you are a London person, maybe Look into New York, San Francisco. The homeless encampments and zombies are something you'd get used to, but not a lot of other cities in the US that are somewhat walkable and that have architecture with a minimum of aesthetic sense.

The way most Americans live will have you on anti depressants within a year.; Wanna see receipts?; Just a different kind of risk; ""Far more money has been lost by investors trying to anticipate corrections, than lost in the corrections themselves.”    
Personally I don't really see a bubble beyond a few companies with expensive valuations.; Wait for it.....; Do you guys talk this way in real life; Ah, gotcha; Hahaha right on, mate!; [deleted]; Haha okay. Interesting!"
How Long Will You Keep DCA?,"Let's say you are doing DCA for stocks you have high convictions, such as NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, PLTR or RKLB.

And you are doing, say $200 per month or perhaps $500 every quarter (more or less, depending on your financial situations) per stock.

1) At what stage of the stock's life would you then decide to stop DCA? Especially for stocks like MSFT and AAPL that have been around for a long while?

2) Also, while you DCA, would you also sell your initial amount you bought? Or you'd let it ride?

3) What stocks are you guys DCA now?

Thank you folks! 🚀

It's been a fantastic year and want to try and build on that.  A fair amount of growth to me feels increasingly 2021-ish again so the focus goes elsewhere.  I don't know that another 2022 is around the corner, but it wasn't that long ago and after 2020/21, it's kind of remarkable that only a few years later we're back to ""only goes up"" although for a more narrow portion of the market.

At some point the value/blend side I've built lately will probably shift back towards growth (which I prefer over value) but want to have the flexibility to look for opportunities in either.  I've done well enough this year with parts of growth that for me it's the equivalent of a baseball game and it's the 7th/8th inning and you know who's going to win already so you start heading for the exit to get ahead of the traffic. 

And this isn't anything against growth - still own a fair amount of growth and will continue to -  but after a very good year it felt like time to change the playbook somewhat rather than just keep pushing the same bets and hoping they will continue to work in the manner they already have this year. 


""3) What stocks are you guys DCA now?""

I think for me the issue becomes the market feels differently post covid. Anything that is really working gets overextended quicker than ever, anything that isn't working gets thrown out more aggressively than ever and there's everything in the middle. At some point it becomes increasingly difficult to find much that's that compelling in the what's working category and more starts to appeal in the bargain bin. For me, it's gotten to that point. 

I'd like to just own things long-term and there are things over the years that have wound up long-term holds but the way the market feels over the last 4-5 years, it almost feels like what one would reasonably expect over a year for something that's really working suddenly happens in a matter of months and then things eventually get ahead of themselves to a point where the risk/reward is quickly less appealing or unappealing. Some of the buying in the last month in a few things seems indiscriminate/increasingly FOMO-y.

So for me it's not ""gradually DCA into something over the long-term"" as much as I'd like although some things wind up as long-term holdings.  It's renovating the portfolio at times (more times in the last 4-5 years than I can recall ever doing) - taking out portions (removing or reducing a theme, for example), rethinking that portion and rebuilding it. I try to gradually sell into strength and often don't sell something entirely but reduce and keep a smaller portion. I've owned NVDA for years and would like to continue to own it with the cost basis that I have to some degree, but after +1,100% in two years it's been time to gradually trim rather than continue to DCA.; DCA is great if you want to continually invest in the market whenever you have some additional cash. Historically a lump sum will give you higher returns, except if you buy at the top of the market and only hold for a short time.; If we’re talking about LT investing, you would ideally be tracking the companies quarterly reports. Typically, a slip of 2-3 quarters should give you come caution. Now depending on how aggressive of an investor you are, you could sell into the strength and then buy back once the stock pull backs. I think everyone loves to talk about how much their up on a single stock but no one mentions when they sell. Have seen plenty of positions sit in green by 100% and then the holder slowly gives back every % without taking any profit.; Whether to continue DCA should depend on if the stock is still in your buy range or not.   Sometimes the stock gets over their skis for a while because of excessive bullish enthusiasm and are not good new investments.  It doesn't mean you need to sell if the growth picture is still intact.  A patient Hold is sometimes the best action.; When the mount you DCA become less then 10% the interest you gain 

If you DCA 100 a month but you gain more than 1000 per month the 100 dollars don't gonna change wildly anymore; Only when I need money, otherwise why would I leave the market,; In steady state, I usually DCA with diversified indices and do limit orders on specific good stocks at opportune times when they are discounted.

I normally am trying to increase diversification with least tax impact, not my concentration of the biggest winners. When the big winners seriously dwarf the initial investment, I lightly draw on them to fund other positions and recoup initial cost(e.g. selling 10%).

I don't tend to sell stocks of businesses I still believe in when they are overpriced, as long as conditions are still sound.; I am not a big DCA guy for reasons specific to my circumstances, but if I were I would stop when the percent allocation
reached my predetermined limit.; Do you know anything about the valuations of those stocks, and when the price you would pay for the stock has separated from the fundamental value by a large margin? Because if you don't know how to recognize a top, you are likely to find out the hard way.; I will DCA till i hit the 40 year mark or the 40mill mark which ever comes first.; lol this isn’t going to go well.; I DCA as long as we are trending up; About 10 shares of RIVN every week over the next year or so. Looking to accumulate around 1,000 shares before it takes off.; Tsla, pltr, diamond hand till end of the final light of the universe, never ever ever sell; Get ready for Nasdaq 100 inclusion in a week or 2.; What does it do? ..it shows the weaknesses of PE ratio as a method of measurement.; Jesus mother of god....; No idea too lol but continue to DCA?; ""Renovating the portfolio"" is so well put. Often time, I obsess over what I'm going to invest at that moment in time. I pull the trigger and forget about it. I come back to my portfolio a year later. Instead of renovating, I DCA and more often than not lose my way. 

It's a nice way of thinking. It requires discipline which I'm trying to cultivate.; Thanks for sharing. Many times, we are focused on fomo and getting in, and we forgot abt growth. I like the term Renovating your portfolio. I will keep that in mind!; Please can your share some of these stocks that are currently undervalued ?; This is sadly quite true. Or maybe, there's just no fun in sharing taking profits.; This is fair view. Never thought about %gain vs DCA before.; Better to DCA down to lower cost basis.; What's the logic begins RIVN?; Diamond hands is one of the most regarded string of letters ever put together by humankind; So you continue to DCA? Or just hold? 🤔; Yeah. Who cares is stock price is completely detached from company value.

I know. I know. ""future earnings""

Forward P/E is 162.38

People are literally paying $162 for every $1 PLTR *projects* in the next 12 months.

What a deal!; now you know when you should have stopped.. a few years ago; PNG; Yep the biggest your gain IS the less impactfull your DCA deposit IS; No, if we are trending down I exit my position and search for a different equity to hold.; So if i buy at $100, the stock goes up (like the market does 80% of the time) to $200, and i shouldnt have been buying at $110, $120 etc. instead i should buy at $190, $180 since its discounted from that $200 price? Got it.

Or am i expected to wait for it to magically go to $90 so i can truly lower my average. This is a pretty ridiculous take like obviously it would be better to lower your average with each buy, but stocks and s&p500 goes up far more often than it goes down.; I love getting hate from Reddit, its like Cramer shit talking your stocks. When the hate stops, then i will start worrying about the tops

As long as im reversing reddit im golden; Fuck your paper hands then.; Buy and hold, never stops, the space is the limit; Let them pay $400 dollars for the next 12 months ..because my ADHD will have had me pull out after 3-4 months :); And yet somehow it makes sense to everyone. When things come back down to reality, it’ll become so obvious how stupid it was in hindsight; Ah, buy high sell low, got it.; You bought GME at 100 huh?; This dude probably trades every fkin nanoseconds and cry when he underperforms ppl who just buys sp500 etf; Not for those who sold in profit.; On the contrary, sell high buy low:  
https://i.imgur.com/VVw1sUc.png; Nah man, I am mostly a Mag7 and S&P guy. My comment was what the response you would get if you question diamond hands.; Obviously doesn’t apply to them; If you buy on an uptrend, it means you’re buying in on a rally (aka FOMO). If you sell on a downtrend, you’re selling when everyone else is (fear). What’s that buffet quote?; Grow the fuck up we’re not in 2021 anymore. Diamond and paper hands doesn’t mean shit outside of the GME short squeeze; Then stupidity doesn't apply.; I think that graph is pretty self explanatory, working out well for me so far.; If you’re buying it at an inflated price, stupidity applies and will become apparent when the bubble bursts. If you bought before the inflated price and sold at a profit, the stupidity obviously does not apply to you. This is not hard to understand; Could have had more buying the dips and lowering your average, just saying.; ..you don't seem to understand ..and your saying its not hard to understand.. Ookaaay.; I hold mostly levered positions so holding during downtrends is not good for me, The problem is when the dips keep dipping.   
So instead of trying to time it I just follow the SMA strategy, no need to time the buys and sells.      
We were still above the SMA line when everything went down after the July 10th peak, so I DCA'd hard during that time and It worked out so far."

**Why write this?**   

* I feel like we need a solid fucking company.
* I get too scared to buy aviation, nuclear, and crypto stocks.
* They weren’t listed on WSB’s Earnings board.
* I thought more people would like the YOLO.
* They POSSIBLY gave me a backpack when I was MAYBE working with them eight years ago.

[Rubrik Backpack](https://preview.redd.it/aq0rogvya55e1.png?width=628&format=png&auto=webp&s=7dc549da0311f723117c74e29efa2136085b9e84)

**DD Research**

**What is Rubrik ?** 

* Rubrik is a backup & recovery provider that sits on top of a company’s cloud infrastructure.

**What is an example of Backup & Recovery I can maybe understand?** 

* You drop your phone under a tire because you were to busy while parking, leading to a smashing of both it and the SIM card. The only fix is you buy a new phone, login with your iCloud email, and everything is restored from the cloud.
* Rubrik does the above and sells at-cost servers from partners like Dell, HPE, SMCI, etc. They protect data in places like AWS , Azure, and GCP.
* People pay whatever when they have no phone or car. Same here.

**How are you qualified?** 

* I worked at a research company for five years partnering with SaaS vendors $5M-$250M, for two of those years I CAN NEITHER CONFIRM NOR DENY they may have been a client.
* I transitioned to Software Engineering three years ago from Tech Sales. I have tracked them and understand both the sales pitch and technology pitch. 
* I saw them masterfully navigate researchers, which they still do, and become the golden child. Billions of dollars get validated by researchers.... it's importants.
   * [(Updated) They Poached the Magic in 2018](https://www.theregister.com/2018/05/01/rubrik_gartner_hires/). One is doable but not three of them it delayed the research paper a year that doesn’t happen unless a research analyst dies.
   * [(Updated) Because of 2018 poaching the late Fall report never got published (major delay), The 2019 Report Was Fought Back By Rubrik for Flawed Data](https://www.crn.com/news/storage/rubrik-ceo-gartner-data-center-magic-quadrant-seriously-flawed) . I've never seen a CEO do this without blowback Bipul again with a killer move.
   * TL:DR; They were making moves YEARS ago. See article excerpt below.

[This is pretty rare, vendors complain but not publishing a document read by 4k+ CIO controlling the flow of billions of dollars in a sector. It's just insane. There's a lot of big names backing them. ](https://preview.redd.it/x3hcumds365e1.png?width=1152&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f1e26b7a5f66134efaf4447b77fa18f020f0837)

**Who’s in the market? Competitors?** 

https://preview.redd.it/qq3hhafdg55e1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20d4d8a57db7467d15ffd2abaa24459d6ac8d60c

* Their only publicly traded competitor is Commvault which is around $170 and dropping.
* Veeam and Cohesity are private firms with very different architectures, support qualities, and applications. Rubrik is the only one fully doing what it does. They are considered the “Lexus”

**How are they different?** 

* Rubrik views backup and recovery very differently from legacy vendors. They built their architecture based on expecting to get hacked (Backup & Recovery) vs. trying to prevent a hack (Incident Response). It's never been done ""their way"" before.
* Rubrik creates an air gapped layer on top of databases that - even if a hacker gets in they’re quarantined and the user can restore the system cutting them off. Thus less downtime, less support costs, payroll, legal fees, etc.
* They are very partner friendly with Mandiant, Crowdstrike, and Zscaler at least in the cutthroat cyber industry. 
* Rubrik’s leadership , in particular the CEO Bipul Sinha, are not run of the mill. Bipul is personally a very kind, measured, and calculated leader, I’ve met him before. He’s a lovely man but a killer. He’s an engineer with a sales streak like Elon. Bipul has Nutanix and Bromium under his belt. Google Him. He essentially came out of retirement for this company from a cushy ass VC job. 
* They know how to pitch investors, analysts, sales people, clients, basically everyone. They’re as buttoned up as you get and they come to impress. They earned their street cred 100%. 
* They have consistently ranked as #1 according to Gartner in the Magic Quadrant. Beating out companies with very, very large balance sheets that don't have the balls to IPO in 2024.

**Why the sudden pop? (Things I thought were important)** 

* Analysts needed another leap to profitability  due to the only available historicals  being from the April 2024 IPO and September Q2 earnings. This gave them pause on profitability as Rubrik as high operating margin.
* They raised 2025 Guidance. Indicated profitability by end of next year on this Q3 Earnings.
* Things I Heard on their Q3 Earnings today:
   * They mentioned a Fortune 50 Healthcare company selecting them in a competitive win. UnitedHealthcare was hacked in February and had offline billing systems for like 20 days. I’m thinking they signed UNH, that’s a big cookie boys. It’s super fucking hard to rip and replace a legacy vendor. 
   * They passed $1B in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR). This is a big metric. I heard both the Goldman Sachs and Barclays analysts say “Congrats” they seemed to be teeing up easier questions.   
* [Everyone and their mother in Cybersecurity has heard of Rubrik. They got the same award as Google, Facebook, and others a month ago for Entrepreneurship](https://www.rubrik.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/24/rubrik-named-the-2024-entrepreneurial-company-of-the-year-by-the-harvard-business-school-hbs-association-of-northern-california) 
* [This guy’s comment from 6 days ago. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h2q6pw/comment/lzm990m/)
* [Yesterday, December 4th.

**Why did the stock not move from April to September 2024? (Timeline Below...)**

* **April 24th 2024 IPO Financials**
   *  Rubrik reveals a very high operating margin due to sales and marketing investments aka ripping out Zscaler’s sales team doing the “Salesforce” push. Blitzkreg the market. 
   * I believe they started  planning ripping Zscaler in October 2023 , it takes time to ramp up. They probably got all big sales hires in by March with a six month ramp up take lands sales quotes around September when the stock crept up(
   * [Sniping Zscaler Executives and Top Earners in October 2023. They had to give a fuck ton of stock to pry these boys away. ](https://channeleye.co.uk/rubrik-hires-another-zscaler/)
   * [EDIT: (Updated with New Video) This lead to analyst skepticism about pricing controls. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzEhqtSrVUE) 
* **Septemeber 9th 2024 Q2 Earnings Financials** 
   * Earnings were month after the late July 2024 Crowdstrike hack, I do not think Rubrik was able to accelerate deal velocity to report ARR high enough to relieve market analysts and critics of the operating margin. They were asked about “deal velocity” by analysts today and it seems like the markets are pleased. 
   * [Bloomberg video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGvI0QbzzkY) from post-earnings is killer and a good recap of market sentiment.
   * [Rubrik Search Trends Peaked In April Coinciding With the Major UNH Hack; however, they droped off after the huge spike.](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=rubrik&hl=en)
      * I think analysts expected a quicker deal cycle around the UNH hack, 4 months/120 days is a very fast enterprise sales cycle. Most large sales deals can take 6-12 months if not longer.
* **October 2024:** 
   * I believe deal velocity picked up from the UNH hack and even with low search results, the three week hack fallout was enough to start sales cycles. Then from the Crowdstrike fallout, even as a partner, highlighted the need to immediately solve it as publicly traded companies were literally offline, no one working.
   * Remember 60-120 days is a very fast sales cycle on any software sale. I think this is where we started heating up here as this is three months out from the hack.  
   * Today on earnings analysts seemed eager to ask about profitability as the CFO and CEO were comfortable to voice the 2026 is the year. Look there's alot of tech companies with -40 EPS floating around. It's not 2013-2018 you can't float on negative earnings and millions of users. <--- the market is speaking, you have to make money as a tech company.
* **November 2024:** 
   * Rising cybersecurity risk from election, TikTok hack, etc. Fidelity even paused my money for four weeks in a CMA because they had security issues with fraud. 
   * Stock was ticking up.
* **December 4th, 2024  (Yesterday):**
   * Veeam $2B announcement mentioned earlier.
   * Volume doubles to nearly 2M. It was 700k in July 2024. It's 4M Today. Nuts.

**Where will it go?**

* It seem comparable to Zscaler and Commvault in valuation. I'm long on it and believe it'll push past $100 by July 2025.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h7s0om/rbrk_rubrik/,119,2024-12-06 04:27:11,"

Spend like a couple hours watching interviews, looking at the majority investors and board. Then see what you want to do. Ask yourself do I understand the pitch and am I buying it? Then ask is the market buying it? 

I liked having cash flow to deploy over two weeks so I didn’t have to constantly buy and hold big chunks, I expected volatility. 

My percentage limit is now 10% on dips , Rubrik kissed -5% -6% but I watched the bid ask spread and these fuckers were playing footsie moving the spread from $1 to .50, it was very hard to buy anything right in the middle of the spread and the volume was 1/10th of what it was now. 

I am minimum holding everything through next week. I got fucking beat up for 5-6 trading days with the options. The stock was just 4-6xed in volume over the past two weeks. 

I need someone that trade PLTR or NVDA to chime in. 


IMO it’ll dip because it’s not the side wall of a rising cliff. I however am holding as much and long as possible.; This is amazing and I greatly appreciate your insight here! RBRK will be on my radar moving forward now. Enjoy those gains! I’m jelly and wish I’d see your post sooner 🤣."
What is your thought on my portfolio and strategy?,"I'm 30M. I recently started investing in ETF & individual stocks. Below is my portfolio I figured it out myself, but I am not sure if it is reasonable in the long run, and I want to hear other people's opinions, comments, and criticism on it. I put in a lump sum (a large amount of my saving money after I excluded emergency money) and plan to DCA monthly.

**ETF 75%**  
\- iShares Core MSCI World (Acc) - IWDA

**Individual stocks 25%**  
\- **Tech Growth 12%:** Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon, Palantir, Nvidia, Tesla  
\- **(High-)dividend 5%:** Siemens, Merck & Co, Swiss Re, Exxon Mobil, McDonald  
\- **Consumer defensive 3%:** UnitedHealth, Mastercard, Cola  
\- **Personal favorite 3.5%:** Garmin, Air Product and Chemicals, Walmart, Rolls-Royce, Airbus  
\- **Aerospace & Defensive 1.5%**: Rocket Lab, Howmet, RTX Corp

The reason that my portfolio contains more than 20 stocks is that I want to diversify it in terms of the stocks, not types of assets. 

My concerns/questions are:

1. I'm not sure if I hold too many stocks in the same category (e.g. tech stocks) and most of them are already covered by the IWDA ETF.
2. I'm also considering holding only 1 or 2 high-dividend stocks like AbbVie, instead of 5 dividend stocks. Is it a good idea?
3. My long-term plan follows ""time in the market > timing the market"". So I plan to split DCA in half and put in ETF and stocks equally. I also read about the [Enhanced DCA](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b40399/enhanced_dollar_cost_averaging/). Statistically, is the Enhanced DCA worth a try?

All suggestions are welcome. I'm happy to give more information and appreciate any help you can provide. :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h7mstv/what_is_your_thought_on_my_portfolio_and_strategy/,0,2024-12-06 00:13:24,"Honestly depends on how much you know about each company. Knowing those companies inside and out is arguably more valuable than not fully understanding a diversified single stock portfolio. I tend to do 40% in VOO, 10% in FTEC, 10% in FDIS, 5-10% in both Small and Mid-Cap ETFs (VOT and VB) and then everything else is technology because I know that the inside and out. I scrapped dividend stocks because I’m not sure where I’ll be able to write off long-term investment gains down the road in life (I’m 29) and don’t want to pay taxes on those dividends now. With that being said, a set of corporate bonds may be wise to make things more conservative (SPHY).; Isn't that holding too many ETFs a bad idea?; I would argue the opposite. Far less risk. Less reward, but unless you spend day and night researching the individual stocks, you likely won’t beat the ETF."
TSMC in talks with Nvidia for AI chip production in Arizona,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is in discussions with Nvidia Corp to produce its Blackwell artificial intelligence chips at the contract manufacturer's new plant in Arizona, three sources familiar with the matter said.

TSMC is already making preparations to start production early next year, the sources said.

Nvidia's Blackwell chips, which the company unveiled in March, have so far been manufactured at TSMC's facilities in Taiwan. The company has seen high demand from customers involved in generative AI and accelerated computing for the chips, which it says is 30 times speedier at tasks like serving up answers from chatbots.

The agreement, if finalised, would secure another customer for TSMC's Arizona facility, which is scheduled to start volume production next year.

TSMC and Nvidia declined to comment. The sources did not want to be identified as the talks were confidential.

Two of the sources said Apple (AAPL) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are current customers at the Arizona plant. Apple and AMD did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

However, while TSMC plans to produce the front-end process of Nvidia's Blackwell chips in Arizona, the chips will still need to be shipped back to Taiwan for packaging. The Arizona facility does not have chip on wafer on substrate (CoWoS) capacity that is essential to the Blackwell chips, two of the sources said.

All of TSMC's CoWoS capacity is currently in Taiwan.

Taiwan's TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, is investing tens of billions of dollars in building three facilities in Phoenix and the project has won significant subsidies from the U.S. government which wants to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States.

Tesla: Unveiling the Overvaluation—A Comprehensive Analysis. Short Seller Report. (TSLA) Stock Equity Investing,"Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) has emerged as one of the most polarizing entities in contemporary financial history, boasting a market capitalization surpassing the combined worth of established automakers such as Toyota, Ford, and General Motors. Although the company has undeniably transformed the automotive and energy sectors, our analysis indicates that Tesla's valuation is driven by speculative enthusiasm rather than enduring fundamentals.

This report highlights substantial concerns regarding Tesla's financial performance, competitive positioning, and speculative projects such as the Optimus robot. Utilizing a macroeconomic perspective, it incorporates the Buffett Indicator and Shiller P/E Ratio to position Tesla within a broader market bubble. Our analysis concludes that Tesla is overvalued by nearly every metric, presenting a strong case for re-evaluating investment in the company.

**Disconnect from Fundamentals** P/E and Market Multiples 

Tesla's valuation metrics are inflated to speculative levels, outpacing both its peers and historical precedents: 

**Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio (TTM):** Tesla’s Price-to-Earnings stands at **94.55**, far above the automotive industry average of 5-15. For context, NVIDIA (a high-growth tech company) trades at 62x, and Apple, with its mature, stable business model, trades at 30x. Even against leading tech companies, Tesla’s P/E ratio is disproportionately high. 

**Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio:** Tesla trades at 8.95x sales, while Toyota and Ford hover below 1x. By comparison, NVIDIA’s P/S is approximately 16x, justified by its dominance in high-margin, rapidly expanding AI markets. Tesla’s lower-margin automotive business does not command the same pricing power or scalability, making its P/S ratio harder to justify. 

**Enterprise Value to EBITDA:** Tesla’s EV/EBITDA: 81.72, significantly higher than traditional automakers like GM (\~7x) and Toyota (\~6x). 

Tech Companies EV/EBITDA: 

* NVIDIA (NVDA): \~41x (Q4 2024), driven by its dominance in AI and GPUs. 
* Apple (AAPL): \~24x (Q4 2024), reflecting its mature, high-margin ecosystem.

These valuations assume extraordinary growth and profitability far beyond what Tesla has demonstrated or is likely to achieve given intensifying competitive pressures and technological limitations. 

**Current Market Cap to GDP Ratio**: The Buffett Indicator stands at **208%**, indicating an extreme overvaluation of the U.S. stock market. Tesla’s significant influence within major indices intensifies this systemic risk.

**Shiller P/E Ratio Current S&P 500 CAPE:** At 36.5, the CAPE ratio is nearing levels seen before the dot-com bust and 1929 crash. Tesla’s inflated valuation amplifies the broader market distortion. 

**Financial Performance Analysis** 

Revenue Growth Deceleration Tesla’s revenue growth trajectory is losing momentum: Annual Growth Decline: From **51.35% in 2022 to 18.8%** **in 2023**. Quarterly Revenue Stagnation: Q3 2024 revenue of $25.18 billion represents a sequential decline of 1.25%. **Margin Compression** Tesla's once-dominant margins are eroding under competitive and operational pressures: **Gross Margin:** Dropped to **18.25%** in 2023, reflecting price cuts and rising input costs. **Operating Margin**: Declined to **9.19%**, signaling inefficiencies in scaling operations.

Tesla's profitability is heavily reliant on high-margin regulatory credit sales. Regulatory Credit Dependency Tesla earned $1.78 billion from regulatory credits in 2023, representing 1.8% of revenue but an outsized share of net income. As traditional automakers ramp up EV production, the demand for Tesla's credits will wane, threatening this vital income stream. 

Policy Risk: Potential deregulation under a new administration, such as Donald Trump’s rollback of EV mandates, could eliminate this revenue entirely. 

Free Cash Flow Volatility Annual **Free Cash Flow (FCF)**: Declined by **42.38%** YoY to $4.36 billion in 2023. CapEx Expansion: **Capital expenditures** surged to **$3.5 billion in Q3 2024**, reflecting heavy investments with uncertain ROI. 

Competitive Positioning: Eroding Leadership Market Share Under Siege Tesla’s once-dominant EV market share is eroding as competitors scale production: 

* BYD (China): Outpaced Tesla in global EV sales with a diversified, cost-efficient lineup. 
* Ford and GM (U.S.): Successfully launching competitive models like the F-150 Lightning and Chevy Bolt EUV. 

Volkswagen Group (Europe): Scaling production of the ID series to challenge Tesla in key markets. Limited Product Lineup Tesla offers only four primary models: Model S, 3, X, and Y. Delays in the Cybertruck and Tesla Semi have limited its ability to address growing demand for EV trucks and commercial vehicles. 

**Technological Limitations: The Autonomy Gap** 

Tesla's reliance on a Level 2 autonomous system, marketed as ""Full Self-Driving"" (FSD), raises significant safety concerns. Unlike its competitors, Tesla has faced public scrutiny and legal challenges over a troubling number of fatalities and accidents associated with its Autopilot and FSD systems. Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) system is limited to **SAE Level 2**, requiring constant driver supervision. Despite its branding as ""Full Self-Driving,"" Tesla's system lags behind competitors who are deploying higher levels of autonomy. Competitors Advancing in Autonomy 

* Waymo (**Alphabet**): Operating **Level 4** autonomous vehicles in urban and suburban environments, Waymo leverages a robust sensor suite, including lidar, radar, and cameras, to achieve safe, driverless navigation. 
   * Despite millions of miles driven in autonomous mode, Waymo has not reported any fatal accidents involving its vehicles. The company’s use of lidar, radar, and stringent testing protocols prioritizes safety above all else.
*  Cruise (**General Motors**): Similarly deploying **Level 4** autonomous vehicles, Cruise has demonstrated fully driverless operations in cities like San Francisco and Phoenix. 
   * Similarly, Cruise operates its autonomous fleet in complex urban environments without any recorded fatalities. Rigorous validation and oversight underpin its commitment to safety. 

**Mercedes-Benz**: Achieved **Level 3** autonomy, allowing drivers to disengage under specific conditions, and is actively scaling this capability in key markets like Germany.

* As a pioneer in achieving Level 3 autonomy, Mercedes-Benz adheres to strict European safety standards. The company has not been implicated in fatal incidents linked to its autonomous technology. 

**Tesla's Refusal to Adopt Lidar**: A Strategic Misstep Lidar, a gold standard for environmental perception in autonomous vehicles, is absent from Tesla’s sensor suite. While Tesla relies solely on cameras and neural networks, this approach limits its ability to detect objects with the precision and reliability required for higher levels of autonomy. Lidar offers redundancy and reliability in adverse conditions, such as poor weather or low visibility. Tesla’s omission of lidar raises safety and regulatory risks. 

Regulatory Roadblocks: Tesla's current system may struggle to meet the stringent safety standards required for **Level 4 or 5 autonomy**. The Business Model Constraint Tesla's refusal to adopt lidar is not solely technological—it is economic. Adding lidar would dramatically **increase production costs**, undermining Tesla’s ability to maintain competitive pricing in a margin-sensitive market. 

Cost Implications: The inclusion of lidar could add $1,000 to $2,000 per vehicle in hardware costs alone, compressing Tesla’s **already declining gross margins**. 

Reliance on Low Costs: Tesla’s market position **depends on producing vehicles at a relatively low cost**. Embracing lidar and other advanced sensors would necessitate higher vehicle prices or **reduced profitability**—both untenable given Tesla’s current valuation pressures. Tesla Will Struggle to Deliver a High-Quality, Level 5 Vehicle Tesla’s business model prioritizes cost efficiency over technological advancement. This approach limits Tesla’s ability to compete with high-quality offerings from rivals like Mercedes-Benz and Waymo. This makes the realization of a Level 5 fully autonomous vehicle—the holy grail of autonomy—highly unlikely in the foreseeable future. While also ensuring Tesla will continue to deliver lower-quality vehicles compared to competitors who balance advanced technology with rigorous quality standards. Tesla's technological and economic constraints reveal a fundamental flaw in its autonomy strategy. While competitors like Waymo, Cruise, and Mercedes-Benz lead the charge toward true self-driving vehicles, Tesla remains limited by its cost-driven model, prioritizing affordability over technological robustness. This gap will only widen as regulatory demands for safety and precision increase, further eroding Tesla’s competitive edge in the autonomy race. 

**Speculative Ventures: The Optimus Robot and Financial Impossibilities** Tesla’s foray into humanoid robotics through the Optimus project exemplifies speculative spending on unproven technologies. While CEO Elon Musk has branded Optimus as a revolutionary product that will transform industries, the financial and technological hurdles are insurmountable given Tesla’s existing commitments. 

Development Stage: Early and Unimpressive Current Optimus prototypes remain far from market ready. Demonstrations reveal robots controlled remotely, lacking the autonomy necessary to perform even basic tasks reliably. Musk has claimed Optimus will perform functions ranging from warehouse labor to elder care, yet no substantial evidence supports the viability of this vision in the near term. 

Competition: Boston Dynamics’ Atlas Robot: Years ahead in functionality and autonomy, Atlas showcases capabilities like complex navigation, load handling, and task performance, including construction-related activities. Tesla lags far behind established players like Boston Dynamics, whose decades-long focus on robotics has yielded tangible results. 

Optimus, in its current form, appears more akin to a marketing spectacle than a functional product. 

Tesla’s ability to deliver a viable Optimus robot, while maintaining profitability and fulfilling its other ambitious promises (such as Level 5 autonomy), faces significant financial constraints: 

**High Production Costs**: The estimated Bill of Materials (BOM) for Optimus is $50,000-$60,000 per unit, with components like robotic hands costing upwards of $10,000 alone. Scaling production to mass-market levels without compromising profitability would require unprecedented efficiency improvements, which Tesla has not demonstrated in its automotive business. 

Lack of Focus: Tesla is already grappling with **slowing vehicle sales**, **declining margins**, and the **high capital expenditure needed for its core EV business**. Simultaneously pursuing **Level 5 autonomy** and **humanoid robotics** is **financially and operationally unsustainable**. The Conflict Between FSD, Vehicles, and Optimus Tesla’s current valuation assumes success across multiple frontiers—producing low-cost vehicles, achieving full Level 5 autonomy, and scaling humanoid robotics. However, these goals are mutually exclusive given Tesla’s financial and technical limitations.

Level 5 Autonomy Challenges: Achieving this milestone requires heavy investment in lidar or other advanced sensor technologies that Tesla has eschewed to preserve margins. Without these investments, FSD remains stuck at Level 2, far behind competitors. 

Vehicle Profitability Risks: Tesla relies on cutting costs in its automotive production to maintain competitiveness. **Diverting resources** to **Optimus** would further strain vehicle **margins** and **reduce its ability to compete** in the increasingly crowded EV market. Successfully building Optimus at scale would demand massive R&D expenditures, high production costs, and extensive testing—placing further pressure on Tesla’s finances. 

Financial Risks to Shareholders Elon Musk’s vision for Optimus, paired with Tesla’s ongoing promises of Level 5 autonomy and affordable EVs, creates a trifecta of expectations that cannot be achieved simultaneously.

Investor Dilution Risk: Funding these speculative ventures may necessitate raising capital, diluting shareholder equity further. **Profitability at Risk**: Optimus development would drain resources needed to maintain Tesla’s **fragile profit margins**, which have already been compressed to **18.25%** **gross** margin in 2023. Credibility Concerns: Years of missed deadlines on promises like Level 5 autonomy raise doubts about Tesla’s ability to deliver on Musk’s bold claims, tarnishing investor confidence over time. **Tesla’s Optimus robot is emblematic of the company’s speculative spending and overpromised vision.** The inherent financial impossibilities of simultaneously scaling Optimus, achieving Level 5 autonomy, and maintaining vehicle profitability underscore a fundamental flaw in Tesla’s business strategy. 

Unlike its competitors, Tesla is spread too thin, risking operational focus, financial stability, and shareholder value. As Musk continues to promise breakthroughs, **the gap between reality and rhetoric only widens, making Tesla’s lofty ambitions increasingly untenable.** Operational Challenges Quality Control Issues Tesla continues to face manufacturing defects and recalls: High Recall Rate: Frequent recalls, including software glitches and mechanical failures, have raised concerns about **production quality.** Customer Complaints: Limited-service centers and long repair times **undermine Tesla’s brand reputation**. Tesla’s competitors have prioritized safety, employing rigorous testing, comprehensive sensor suites (including lidar), and conservative rollout strategies. This stark contrast underscores the risks of Tesla’s cost-cutting approach: **Inventory Build-Up** Tesla’s days of inventory increased to **28 days** in Q3 2024, suggesting weakening demand relative to production levels. 

Tesla has historically been a leader in electric vehicle (EV) battery technology, notably with its high energy density and efficient thermal management systems. However, competitors are rapidly advancing, challenging Tesla's dominance in this critical area. Competitors' Advances in Battery Technology 

* BYD's Blade Battery: BYD's Blade Battery utilizes lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry, offering enhanced safety and longevity. Its thin, blade-like design allows for higher energy density and improved space utilization within the vehicle. 
* CATL's Qilin Battery: Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL) has developed the Qilin battery, which boasts a record-breaking volume utilization efficiency of 72% and an energy density of up to 255 Wh/kg. This enables longer driving ranges and faster charging times. 
* Solid-State Batteries: Companies like Toyota are investing in solid-state battery technology, which promises higher energy density, faster charging, and improved safety over traditional lithium-ion batteries. 

Tesla's introduction of the 4680 battery cells aims to **reduce costs** and improve vehicle range. These cells are larger and designed to be integrated into the vehicle's structure, enhancing efficiency. However, **production challenges have delayed their widespread implementation**, allowing competitors to narrow the technological gap. 

**Impact of Rising Lithium Prices** The EV industry is heavily reliant on lithium, a critical component in battery production. Recent trends indicate a significant increase in lithium prices due to supply constraints and escalating demand. **Lithium carbonate prices have surged, reaching unprecedented levels.** This escalation is attributed to the rapid growth in EV adoption and limited expansion in lithium extraction and processing capacities. Supply Constraints: The **International Energy Agency (IEA) warns of potential lithium shortages by 2025**, which could hinder the scaling of EV production globally. Implications for Tesla Cost Pressures: **Rising lithium prices directly impact battery production costs**. For Tesla, which aims to produce mass-market EVs at competitive prices, these **cost increases** could **compress profit margins** or necessitate higher vehicle prices, potentially reducing demand. 

Tesla's ambitious production targets may be jeopardized by lithium supply bottlenecks, leading to potential delays in vehicle deliveries and an inability to meet market demand. While Tesla remains a significant player in the EV market, its lead in battery technology is being challenged by competitors' innovations. Coupled with the financial pressures from rising lithium prices and potential supply shortages, Tesla faces substantial challenges in maintaining its competitive edge and profitability in the evolving EV landscape. 

**Legal and Regulatory Risks** 

* **Autopilot Investigations**: Multiple NHTSA probes into Autopilot-related accidents could result in costly recalls or fines. 
* **Misleading Marketing Claims:** Lawsuits alleging false advertising of Tesla’s FSD capabilities pose reputational and financial risks. Tesla’s valuation is built on speculative optimism that diverges significantly from its financial and operational realities. The company faces a convergence of critical challenges: 
* **Slowing Revenue Growth and Margin Compression**: Revenue growth has decelerated, while declining gross and operating margins highlight the financial strain of maintaining competitive pricing amidst rising costs. 
* **Reliance on Unsustainable Revenue Streams**: Regulatory credit sales, a key driver of profitability, are vulnerable to policy changes and decreasing demand as competitors ramp up EV production. 
* **Technological and Strategic Constraints**: Tesla’s Level 2 autonomy lags far behind competitors like Waymo and Cruise, who have deployed Level 4 solutions. The company’s refusal to adopt lidar reflects cost-driven compromises that limit its ability to achieve higher levels of safety and autonomy. 
* **Speculative Ventures:** The Optimus robot project exemplifies Tesla’s foray into high-risk, unproven technologies. Building and scaling Optimus while pursuing Level 5 autonomy and maintaining profitability is financially and operationally implausible. 
* **Eroding Market Position**: Tesla’s dominance in the EV market is waning, with competitors like BYD, Volkswagen, and GM offering cost-effective and innovative alternatives that threaten Tesla’s market share. 
* **Safety and Reputational Risks**: Fatalities linked to Tesla’s Autopilot underscore the dangers of overpromising and underdelivering, contrasting sharply with the safer, more transparent approaches of competitors. 
* **Challenges in Battery Technology**: While Tesla has historically led in battery innovation, competitors like BYD, CATL, and Toyota are closing the gap with advanced technologies like the Blade and Qilin batteries, as well as solid-state innovations. Production delays and scaling issues with Tesla’s 4680 cells further erode its competitive edge. 
* **Rising Costs of Key Commodities**: The surge in lithium prices and potential shortages of critical materials like cobalt and nickel threaten to increase production costs and compress margins. For Tesla, which relies on aggressive pricing to sustain demand, this adds a significant financial burden. 
* **Macro indicators such as the Buffett Indicator (208% of GDP) and the Shiller P/E Ratio (36.5)** place Tesla’s valuation within the context of broader market overvaluation, further amplifying the risk of a correction. 

Tesla’s ability to sustain its valuation assumes simultaneous success in producing low-cost vehicles, achieving Level 5 autonomy, and scaling speculative projects like Optimus—all while maintaining profitability and navigating intensifying competition. This multifaceted challenge is not only improbable but also exposes shareholders to significant downside risk. 

As competitors advance technologically, diversify product offerings, and secure more efficient supply chains, Tesla’s vulnerabilities become increasingly evident. Combined with macroeconomic pressures and systemic overvaluation, Tesla’s stock is poised for significant correction, making it a high-risk holding for investors.

Great article and thanks for putting it here.

I agree with some of your points here but disagree with others. Are you open to me just pointing out where I disagree so we can have a conversation to maybe reevaluate your position?

1. PE, PS, EBITDA: as many would also point out, Tesla is a tech company, not a car company. Its major tech advancement is the embodiment of AI. Which is also in the AI industry. Moreover It has businesses that has a high profit margin, such as sunroof and ev charging. Although I do agree 120 PE is pretty high.

2. FSD: I think they’re on the same level. Either all L2, or all L4. Regulatory risk is low due to the alignment with politics. 

3. LiDAR: I don’t think this is an issue. AI FSD is best used with cameras. LiDAR is redundant. Hence the following claims about prices are not really an issue either.

4. Optimus: Not sure if R&D in Optimus is a good thing or bad thing. It keeps the narrative going and the expectation justifies the price. Viewing it as purely bad might be a bit biased."
17 year old looking for some long term investment ideas,"This is not my first rodeo with the stock market, I've been trading since 2020 (13), and the only two major long term investments that I have is Apple and VTI, both serving me greatly. I would consider Rivian to also be a long term stock, but it is more risky than the other two. My portfolio mainly consists of Tech stocks as for it is a market I am actively participating in and informed about, but I'm open to broadening markets. 

I was either planning on dumping more money into VTI, however as it reached $300 It became a bit too expensive for me to want to invest more in. Something I'm more concerned about is a crash, especially in the tech market as for it is reaching all time highs, but from what the tech market has shown in the past decade, is UP with some downs obviously. I know VOO and other vanguard ETF's are shown to do really well, but most of them are expensive, but in the end it may just be worth it.

I'd assume following hedge funds might be more reasonable than following a politician tho haha; I posted them all last week if you Wana check my post history, they're the only images I posted; Okay yeah that makes sense, sorry I guess what I meant was that it is expensive in which I won’t be able to buy many shares of the stock, like maximum 2 or 3 shares, which isn’t bad, but I’m not sure if it’s worth looking into cheaper alternatives; Okay makes sense; I’m very bummed about Reddit, I bought when it first opened, but sold at a loss, I had no faith in the company, and I live with that regret, but don’t stress about it too much.

MDA Space $MDALF is profitable and will possibly be trading in the US Stock market soon,"This great Canadian Space sector company ( [https://mda.space](https://mda.space) ) has a beautiful chart showing their growth and is profitable. They have market cap of 3.2 Billion. What do they do?

MDA Space is a technology and services company that provides advanced solutions to the global space industry:

* **Geointelligence**: Uses satellite data and imagery for climate change monitoring, national security, and global commerce
* **Robotics & Space Operations**: Provides autonomous robotics and vision sensors for space exploration
* **Satellite Systems**: Provides spacecraft and systems for space-based services, including broadband internet connectivity 

MDA Space has a history of firsts and over 450 missions. They have been providing operational readiness support for the International Space Station's (ISS) Mobile Servicing System since 2001. They are also known for delivering large-scale robotic systems, such as Canadarm2.

And this excerpt from a post by user manolo44 sure is bullish:

""Their earnings report was stellar: growth of 38% yoy, it is actually **PROFITABLE** \- none of the other space companies are profitable - profitability with adjusted EBITDA of $55.5 million, up 30% YoY, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.7%, net income up 60% yoy, and net debt adjusted EBITDA ratio of just 0.8x (so zero risk of dilution). However, post earnings the stock was mostly flat. Why? Their reported backlog was unchanged from previous quarter report (backlog is 4.6B btw).

But if any of you folks had bothered to tune in to the call, you would have heard the CEO say that it is a fact that by year end they will be **definitely be signing a new contract worth 750M** – of these, only 300M is recorded in backlog – a**n additional $450M is going to be added** upon finalization and t**his will happen by year’s end.** They in fact stated during the Q&A that they are confident they will be finishing 2024 with $5B backlog. They also said MDA’s satellite systems division alone has a $**15B+ pipeline** of potential projects, thanks to its Aurora-class satellites tailored for low Earth orbit  constellations.

 MDA is building a new 185,000 sq. ft. facility in Quebec, **capable of producing two satellites per day** starting in late 2025.""

And then I heard this:

MDA Space, which is a sleeping giant merely because it trades in the Toronto Stock Exchange rather than US, is exploring listing in the US, according to comments by its CEO;

“Management suggested that it continues to explore a potential dual stock listing in the U.S.""

Now I am not sure how a dual listing will effect my 500 MDALF shares but if I had to guess I would say it will be a good thing.

There have been posts on Reddit about how bad of a company they are to their employees, but just like Yelp you usually only hear about the bad apples, not the good ones, so I take that with a grain of salt. This article that came out today today says they are ""one of Toronto's greatest employers""

---

**Ticker:** MDALF (MDA Space Ltd.)

**Direction:** Up

**Prognosis:** Strong Buy

**Reasoning:** Profitable Canadian space company with significant growth, large backlog, potential for US listing, and analyst upgrades.  CEO stated a new $750M contract coming soon.


**Bonus:**  Makes two satellites a day by late 2025 (!!)

**Caveat:** Some negative employee reviews online.; This is one of my highest conviction plays on small cap stocks. Huge revenue growth, huge earnings growth, margin expansion, large pipeline of new products and contracts, and decades of success as a space manufacturer. 

Dual listing on a US exchange opens them up to billions of dollars in new investment from funds that are bullish on space and have very few public options. Any pullbacks are generational buying opportunities imo. 

Not that they’re directly comparable, but RKLB is one of the few other publicly traded space companies that even has revenue. MDA market cap  is 80% cheaper, while having double the revenue, net profitability, higher margins, and more government contracts in backlog. Just food for thought. 

Disclaimer: I own ~1,000 shares that I’ve been buying every few months since IPO. Also owned MAXR in the past who spun off MDA in 2020; I have been watching this but have had money tied up in other things; I didn't read any of that shit, do they make Molly?  RFK makes this very bullish if they make Molly.; Some more good news and recognition today:

[https://spaceq.ca/europes-proba-3-launches-with-critical-canadian-technology-onboard/](https://spaceq.ca/europes-proba-3-launches-with-critical-canadian-technology-onboard/); Im from Québec i love poutine im going to go watch the operations with my own eyes! 

Im in; What happens in there are 25% tariffs; I have a strong 3k position in them and believe they will be 2-5x in the next couple years.
Strong backlog, lots of expansion for satellite factory space with their new buildings in Quebec, and really turning the corner from one-offs to a production line style build.;

thanks, I did not consider this; When ISS goes down. Who knows. The legacy program will be shut down but they have a bunch of new projects with the US and Canadian government. Most of their projects are classified.; TABARNACLE  
I'm in too.; I was worried about that, but there is a post with DD that I couldn't find just now that stated that since they have an office in Houston Texas they will be able to skirt the tariffs. And something about the dual stock listing in the US market was Brought up as well. Good question though and if I can find the post I will reply back. I will also contact their Investor Relations with that question.

[https://mda.space/contact/usa](https://mda.space/contact/usa); I watched a spacex documentary ladt night on bloomberg 24/7 and they were talking about many countries being in the race to build their own constellation. Im not too worried about tariffs as they are more like negociation leverage tactics and arent a plain % numbers for everything. There are always many exceptions and different tariffs. 

Being in a space race again, im confident tariffs wont be applied on things that could benefit the us.; agreed.

 if it dips lower near market close I will be buying more.; actually once I started buying stocks that had charts like MDALF I realized it was because the company was healthy and revenues were increasing. Before I would buy companies that had charts that looked like this one, hoping that I timed the bottom correctly, and would be surprised when the it didnt go my way.

SCHG vs. SPLG vs. SCHD: Too Much Overlap?,"I’m considering these ETFs for my portfolio: SCHG (growth stocks), SPLG (broad S&P 500), and SCHD (dividend/value focus). I’m worried about overlap—here’s what I’ve found:
	
•	SCHG vs. SPLG: High overlap (~30%-40%) due to shared large-cap growth names like Apple and Microsoft. SPLG is broader but tech-heavy.
	
•	SCHG vs. SCHD: Minimal overlap. SCHG is growth-focused, while SCHD avoids most tech in favor of dividend payers like Pepsi and Coke.
	
•	SPLG vs. SCHD: Moderate overlap; both hold large-cap dividend stocks but differ in sector balance.

What’s your take? Worth holding all three, or are two enough?",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h6qxo7/schg_vs_splg_vs_schd_too_much_overlap/,3,2024-12-04 21:56:00,"There is a lot of overlap, but if you want to invest in multiple it can be done as a method of risk shifting or volatility shifting or whatever it's called (Tilting?). So like if SCHG is too hot, but SCHD is too cold, you can mix them together. Or maybe SPLG would be juuuuust right (I actually get SCHB).; Overlap isn't bad, it might even increase gains.  Naked qqq outperforms most diverse ports.

That said i personally have QQA, SDY, DGRW

QQA: aggressive,  risky tech dividend

SDY: defensive industrial dividend 

DGRW: diverse blend,  sp500 type dividend


With this setup you have a huge variety of sectors, from tech to finance to candy to steel and oil.  For more gains allocate more to qqa. For even more riskier gains get BITO bitcoin etf it pays dividends; So there is a lot of overlap but it wouldn’t necessarily hurt to hold all 3?; I don't think so. Just makes your list longer and your taxes more complicated."

Who would have thought being able to access confidential and potentially stock-moving amounts of information on your phone might require that you give up some privacy on the devices that allow you that access. This dude didn’t even say Apple did spy on him, only that they *could*.

Investment Advice- Rebalancing?,"I am looking for some advice on my current portfolio and savings plan.

I'm a fairly recent immigrant to this country (36m) so started my retirement/ savings from scratch in my early 30's. Currently live in a very HCOL city on the west coast, making around 100-150k/ year running my own business as an S corp, where I pay myself a W2 salary thats roughly 60% of my income, which i adjust regularly to stay ahead of taxes. The nature of my work is project based and freelance so every month is different. This year I am paying myself approx 6k gross per month on w2. The remainder of the income from the business and other 1099 income I usually manage to write off completely as I invest it back into the business.

My main expense is rent and utilities, other than that I have no other debt (paid off car, no student debt) aside from small credit card bills (under 3k that I pay off monthly- no interest)

  
**Current Accounts and Savings:**

  
Personal Checking Account- $3k, keep this empty for monthly expenses only. Zero interest. I view this as a pass through account- salary in, bills out.

Business Checking Account- $20k, this account fluctuates a lot depending on cash flow, I usually try to keep it around $20k- thinking I could/ should move at least 50% into an account that accrues some interest. 

SEP IRA (Deductible)- 25k, I max out the contribution yearly, 25% of my w2 income (started this in 2022) I divide that total amount by 12 and make 12 monthly DCA buys into VTI. That's it. Could possibly just start dropping a lump sum?

ROTH IRA- 18k, Maxing this out every year. $500 monthly DCA buys into VTI (50%) VOO (40%) and 10% cash.

M1 Investment Account- $3k, started this is March of this year to start putting some money into some individual stocks and slightly more speculative plays. $100 weekly DCA buys into a basket of stocks MSTR, TSLA, NVDA, AMZN, AAPL, V, LLY  etc. I like to own individual names and regular DCA just keeps the guesswork out.

Regular Brokerage Account- $1.5k, use this for the occasional weekly/ monthly option contract. Any gains over 1.5k just get emptied into the ROTH. I regularly generate 400-500 per month from this account, so most months i don't even need to fund my ROTH from my personal account.

Chase Investment Account- $14k, $400 monthly contribtions, this was a Chase Auto Invest account (mid risk) that yielded about 10%, so below avg market returns. Chase has ended this auto investment service so the money is 80% invested into various funds but the new contributions will just be cash unless i Manually buy new funds. As this has been underperforming the market, i'm thinking about splitting this up over a few of my other accounts to streamline.

  
Crypto- $20k, been buying $100 of BTC weekly for years. Occasionally add bigger lumps on big dips. Will continue this DCA strategy.

  
So my currently contributions to all my accounts are :

  
SEP IRA- 1k monthly DCA into VTI  
ROTH IRA- $500 monthly DCA into VTI/ VOO  
M1- $400 monthly DCA into various QQQ type stocks  
Chase Invest- $400 monthly DCA into money market  
Crypto- $400 DCA into BTC  


I don't really ever sell stocks or funds, unless they become seriously overweight, or I need the cash, which hasn't happened so far.

I'm fairly happy with the amount that I am able to save and invest monthly, just wondering if anyone had advice on how I could streamline this approach, or if there are other account types or assets I should consider. The monthly DCA strategy just works for me because it means I really don't worry too much about market movements, I actually prefer to see prices go down so i can buy more cheaper. 

TLDR: Please critique my current investment strategy, are there any other account types i should be contributing to regularly to build wealth for the future and how could i manage my regular buys/ DCA/ contributions more effectively?",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h5wads/investment_advice_rebalancing/,0,2024-12-03 20:49:45,
"Apple's stock price hits a new high, recapturing the number one spot in market cap. Is a new 'super product cycle' on the horizon?","**As 2025 approaches, the countdown is on for the release of a number of new Apple products. According to reports, Apple will bring a series of anticipated new products in the spring of 2025, covering a number of popular product lines such as the iPhone SE, iPad and MacBook Air. Are investors ready for a new “super cycle”?**

  
**Monday, $ Apple (AAPL.US)$ closed up 0.95%, shares rose to $ 239.59, hitting a new record high, the total market capitalization exceeded 3.62 trillion U.S. dollars, regaining the first global market value throne, compared with the second place of the NVIDIA has been higher than 250 billion U.S. dollars. This year, Apple's cumulative increase of 25.06%.**

It is worth noting that since April this year, Apple's share price ushered in a sustained rise, has risen more than 45% over the closing low point on April 19 this year. The strong performance of Apple's stock price not only reflects the company's growth momentum, but also shows investors' confidence in its future development. What are the driving factors behind this upward trend?

  
Outstanding earnings performance. In the fourth fiscal quarter, when the new generation of iPhones just hit the market, the revenue of Apple's core product, iPhone, returned to positive growth, and the growth momentum exceeded Wall Street's expectations, driving the company's total revenue to a record high for the same period. The solid financial situation undoubtedly provides investors with confidence.

Technology innovation and AI strategic layout. While the core products are changing, Apple is also launching new products, from Apple Watch to smart home products, to meet the diversified needs of consumers. In addition, Apple's continued expansion in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence has laid the foundation for its future growth with the gradual release of Apple's AI capabilities.

Global market expansion. Apple's sales revenue in Europe, Japan and other Asia-Pacific regions outside of China and Japan all accelerated in the fourth fiscal quarter, such as India, Southeast Asia and Africa, which have low smartphone penetration rates and huge market potential, are also growing rapidly. At the same time, Apple is also promoting the relocation of the industrial chain, especially to emerging markets such as India, with a view to further reducing costs, expanding production capacity and developing new market growth points.

It’s going up from running a buyback program in a low-volume market, with holders not wanting to sell this tax year. Really don’t see this as a long-term buy anywhere over 200, maybe even 160 really; iOs 18 will make it crater, don’t worry; [removed]; Apple $500 EOY, to the moon!!!!; Bought it at 120 and sold at 140 when I thought it was overpriced, fuck me; Where's that dude who bet the farm against apple a month ago or so? Let's see the loss porn buddy!; I've not been impressed by apple products since Steve Jobs died. Jobs was the idea guy that pushed innovation and the revolutionary tech explosion at Apple. Tim Cook that succeeded Jobs is a fantastic CEO - but he is about as creative as a pet rock. They need a new Rockstar idea guy to set them onto the next ipod/ iPad/ iPhone... cause simply releasing the same product with a few dozen more megapixels in the camera lense every 16 months ain't moving the needle; $1,000,000 eoy. Do your research. /s; No; Hopefully all the PE ratio bears didn’t follow buffet into selling their portfolios; It’s only up cause I sold.; can't imagine a super cycle is on the horizon. that last one was a perfect storm of China allowing Apple into it's market. there's no catalyst like that coming up.; Apple's stock price is another classic example of the highly over valued American Stock market. As if there are no downside risks and it's huge profit margin will only improve further. 

By definition a company is never able to earn more than its turnover. But costs will never be 0, so in reality profit margins can't come close to 100% of a companies' turnover. That means companies with a very strong market position and high profit margins mainly increase their profits by increasing turnovers. Growth of turnovers is organisation wise limited though. Very few companies manage to increase their turnovers by over 25-30% on average for 5 to 10 consecutive years. 

That all being said, valuations of over 3 times turnovers are an indication of speculation. The turnover of Apple only increased 2% this year, and even dropped almost 3% last year. So profit growth was mainly because of cost cutting and improved profit margins. Apple trades at 9 times turnovers, 3 times the above mentioned 3 times turnover ceiling of rational valuation. The only way the current valuations would be justified is when its profit would increase at least 30% next year again. Without significant growth of turnover this would mean a further increase of profit levels to around 35% of turnover. The next year it should go to close to 50% profit margin then. It is simply not making any rational sense.

Then there are the real risks:

1 increased competition. Over 30% of Apple's turnover is  outside America, Europe and Japan. Huawei is developing its own Operating System and does have the full support of the authorities in China. This might become a serious competitor in the coming years especially outside the USA.

2 Vulnerability of Apple's production and supply chain. Most Apple products are still manufactured in China with many Chinese parts. In case of further disruption of Chinese-American relations this is very vulnerable.

3 the largest opportunities for sales growth are in emerging markets like India, Indonesia and other South East Asian countries. But Apple's products are way more expensive than competitors products and in many of these markets and anti-china sentiment is absent or much weaker than in the USA.; I cashed out in late May to pay for my honeymoon.

[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/pe-ratio](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/pe-ratio)

Personally I don't really consider the pre-iPhone era relevant because that was a very different company that was struggling in the PC market. But I'll give it to you there have been points in Apple's 50 year history where PE has been higher. For example, during the massive dot com bust tech recession.; Ignore valuation at your own peril fam.

For me it's not a matter of if it's a matter of when the reversion to the mean happens. Apple simply doesn't have the revenue and earnings growth to support it's outsized valuation. That's an unnecessary gamble IMO. No reason to be overweight Apple right now when you can just buy the tech index and have reasonable exposure to Apple. There's been a flight to safety in mega cap tech the last couple years due to uncertainty about the economy with high inflation. When the economic outlook improves I think we'll see a rotation out of overvalued mega cap tech into everything else.

Personally, I don't think Vision Pro will be a hit and we are already seeing its sales stall. Not that many people want goggles mounted to their head. It certainly won't become as ubiquitous as a phone or watch. They would have to do tens of millions of sales annually of a much cheaper model than the current one to move the needle.

[https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/23/apple-may-stop-producing-vision-pro-by-end-of-2024/](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/23/apple-may-stop-producing-vision-pro-by-end-of-2024/)

And no, PEs have not been too high for the last decade.

[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/pe-ratio](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/pe-ratio)

Apple actually traded at very reasonable PEs relative to the tech index until the last couple years. 5 years ago you could get Apple for 15x earnings in 2019. Now they are 39x earnings. You're paying 2.6x more for every dollar of earnings they produce than you were in 2019. In 2022 their multiple was 22x. You're paying nearly 2x more for every dollar of earnings they produce than just 2 years ago.; You aren’t buying just their services business you’re buying the entire business. That PE ratio combined with their earnings growth is horrendous compared to every other big tech. Their PEG ratio is an absurd 2.5x. And their gross margin is very weak compared to MSFT, META, NVDA, GOOGL.

Earnings and earnings growth metrics are boomer metrics until they aren’t. I heard the same thing in 2021 when all the massively overvalued stocks tanked hard. There’s always a reversion to the mean.; Not sure if I responded to this, but thanks for the context my friend; spying lawsuit = nothingburger.  Company provides hardware to employees, has a right to monitor it. Every company does that.; Apple was apart of the google monopoly lawsuit in 2022 google paid Apple like 22 billion to be the search engine so Apple just lost 30 billion a year cause I doubt the payment stayed that low at 22 billion; It will summarize your emails and that's about it

When they finally have live translations with Airpods (like Google's), or edit people out of photo backgrounds (like Google's), or improve their trash keyboard, then their AI will be genuinely useful; I can't - I admit I drink the Apple koolaid. I'm in too deep now in terms of convenience and usability. They got me; I'm team android & I use a PC. The only apple product i have is an old 256 gig ipod that I use for a portable drive & to listen to my 90s grunge & metal at the gym and on long flights while pretending to sleep so nobody bothers me. 

I'm basically apple free living.; OP didn't get to where he is today from having clairvoyance either.

He took a risk with Apple. Same applies to whether you dare take the risk; [removed]; You're way off on those numbers. The Google-Apple search deal was worth about $18-20B in 2021, not $22B, and the lawsuit isn't even close to settled yet. The DOJ antitrust trial is still ongoing and [Apple's Services revenue actually grew 14% YoY](https://beyondspx.com/article/apple-inc-nasdaq-aapl-embracing-the-future-with-cutting-edge-innovation) even with all this drama.

Even if the Google deal gets axed (big if), Apple's sitting on $153B in cash. They could literally build their own search engine or partner with Bing/DuckDuckGo. Plus their services segment is already pulling in $71B annually - the Google money is just one piece of that pie.

Look at the bigger picture - Apple's crushing it with 46.3% margins and revenue growth across most regions. One lawsuit ain't gonna tank a $3T company, especially when they've got the best lawyers money can buy and Buffett backing them with nearly a billion shares.

The real move is watching how they handle this [employee spying lawsuit](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-faces-lawsuit-allegedly-spying-165143754.html) - that could actually cause some PR damage if it blows up. But the Google thing? That's just noise for now.; banana; I’m full porting to ASTS. See you in 14. !RemindMe 14 years; Bruh their profit margins are already accounted for in their earnings and earnings growth. The growth in services revenue is already accounted for in their earnings and earnings growth. What is so hard to understand about this.

No reason to be overweight Apple here at these absurd valuations. Owning the index you already get 7% exposure to Apple.; even if the google thing goes against them, it will take 5-10yrs to play out with appeals and by then I am sure they will have structured some other way of that pay-to-play so both apple and google still maintain that status quo if they want to.; I will be messaging you in 14 years on [**2038-12-04 13:31:39 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2038-12-04%2013:31:39%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h5rq2e/apples_stock_price_hits_a_new_high_recapturing/m0d5krv/?context=3)

|-|-|-|-|; Bruh good luck staying put in that stock for 14 years.....

Advise you to get off WSB if you want to remain that committed; You're missing the fundamental growth acceleration story here. Current earnings don't fully capture the network effects and scaling potential of Apple's ecosystem. Their services segment isn't just about the current 14% growth - it's about the [expanding margins and recurring revenue streams](https://beyondspx.com/article/apple-inc-nasdaq-aapl-embracing-the-future-with-cutting-edge-innovation) that compound over time as they monetize their massive user base.

The 7% index exposure argument is exactly why you're leaving gains on the table. [Tech is projected for 20% gains through 2025](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/techs-santa-claus-rally-analyst-163637958.html) driven by AI tailwinds, and Apple's cash position lets them make strategic moves that index funds can't capture. They're not just riding the index - they're driving it.

Look at their geographic expansion - revenue records in dozens of countries while China's temporary slowdown masks the bigger picture. The market's pricing in their transformation from hardware company to global tech ecosystem. Being underweight AAPL now is like being underweight MSFT in 2016 because ""cloud growth was priced in.""

Your valuation concerns ignore the quality premium AAPL deserves. High margins, fortress balance sheet, and consistent execution across cycles = higher multiple. The market gets this, which is why they're in the [Magnificent Seven](https://finance.yahoo.com/m/4205eaa9-f620-3a0b-a81a-0e82c7c9fd0b/magnificent-seven-stocks%3A.html) while bears keep calling tops.; Their legal team's already 10 steps ahead on this. Apple and Google both know the mobile search market is too valuable to just walk away from. The multiplier effect Wedbush's talking about with [AI and tech spending](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/techs-santa-claus-rally-analyst-163637958.html) is gonna make that $18-20B look like pocket change in a few years anyway.

Plus their Services revenue is growing like crazy - [14% YoY with record highs](https://beyondspx.com/article/apple-inc-nasdaq-aapl-embracing-the-future-with-cutting-edge-innovation) across multiple countries. They're clearly not just sitting around waiting for the DOJ - they're diversifying revenue streams and pushing into new markets.

The real 4D chess move would be using this as leverage to negotiate an even better deal. Google needs iPhone users way more than Apple needs Google's money at this point. With $153B cash on hand, they could literally fund their own search engine development for decades if they wanted to.; Either tell me what to diamond hands or stop the yapping. It’s either space nuclear or quantum computers. 

(On a second note: look at the exciting shit we can bet on. We a so back); I disagree fam. 

It's quite clear that no price is too high for you since earnings growth and valuation don't factor into your thesis at all. You'd pay 100x earnings for Apple just because they have an ecosystem and 14% services growth. There's no price too high since you have no model to value the company. No reason to continue this discussion.; Nah, if making a search engine and getting people to use it were as simple as dumping the money into it then Apple would have done it a long time ago. They've had the money to do so for well over a decade. The reality is funding it is easy but getting people to use it is an entirely different story. Microsoft dominates PCs but can't get people to use IE/Edge or Bing despite dumping time and money into it. Google Search is incredibly sticky. iPhone users want to use Google and will find a way to do so if Apple removes it as the default on Safari. Google Search is still a top 10 app on iPhone despite already being default on Safari. Apple took the best deal they could get while keeping their users happy.; Eat my dongus you fuckin nerd.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*; [removed]; Bruh, the perfect time for Apple to flex their leverage on search was well over a decade ago. You make it sound way easier than it is. If Apple felt they could challenge Google on Search they would have done it already. Search is and has been worth far more than the payment to be default on Safari. 

Apple is way too late on Search to pull people from Google. The Google deal was great for Apple while it lasted."

I remember when they weren’t such a hot commodity; it would be second (or first, depending on the day) in the 5 year chart, but it's not part of S&P 500, so not included.; MSTR would be second in the last 5 years with a +2408%.; What?; just give it a decade or two, you'll be alright (probably (actually i have no idea)); I beat you, I shorted it at 260; see above in the comments, texas pacific land corp; Agreed; The same question was raised 5, 10, 25 & 20 years ago; My guy, Microstrategy isn’t in the s&p500.; How else do stocks perform, other than price?; I brought it up to her earlier this year - she took it well

I also used to build my own pcs for gaming. My friends and I all loved the NVDA cards over 3dfx, ATI, etc. 

And since I had no clue what to do with the cash (too dumb to diversify) and had lost so much during the internet bubble meltdown, I just figured I would chuck it all into NVDA and ignore it. 

Was just a lucky confluence of factors.; 100% agree. It wasn't in a retirement account, so I'm sure I would have sold most if not all of it by now. Still, fun to dream.; Yeah,  it's like the people lamenting the pizza they bought with Bitcoin years ago.; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260); I posted a response to this question below - just a confluence of lucky factors.; I think you only feel 1/7th of his pain.; I had to come up with enough money to settle the separation.; I've been sticking with the mantra of 'theres going to be more computers in the future than there are now' and that seems to be working just fine. Read a post a good while back, some guy selling all of his amd. I think he went like $2.50 to $40 and he said something like he was only selling because he could and not because he thought amd was done. 

No reason to really believe that in 10 years there will be less cpus and gpus being sold....; You are absolutely right.; How, they are already the largest company by market cap.; MSTR is destroying NVDA over the last 4 years so... not true.; By the way, TSM is currently trading with a PE of around 30. Isn't this really fucking good for a tech company? They are fabricating chips for Apple, nvidia, and AMD. They actually have those companies by the balls. There is no other fab that can meet their speed and power efficiency.; Do you mean TSMC?; My mom told me I have ‘tsm. Not sure how much but I guess I’m pretty rich.; Tiktok, coupons and homeless shelters?; Take out roblox and what would the next thing be for kids?

PLTR is probably doing work that is evil but they essentially have software that analyzes organizational data to help them make decisions, think Skynet from Terminator. Their clients are major governments, military, etc. I think they continue to sign huge contracts that are incredibly sticky with the governments of the world for the foreseeable future.; You are def a bear 🐻 🌈; Not yet 😂; Oh, I forgot, we’re chimps looking at price-indicating line charts. Dividends, earnings, nothing else matters. 📈📉🐒; Hahaha Erica sucks!

Lol; She’s looking in the mirror regretting everything now; Fuck that Erica chick; She’s a cutie in the image you have. Is she single? I may or may not have the 18 on paper.; This is so great. 😂; Good you got divorced from that bag of sand.; and now she has the biggest FOMO, she's probably saying to herself she should of divorced you in 2024 instead of 2008, but then again, saved you hefty lawyer fees/settlement so who really won? lol; Who cheated on whom?; r/madlads; Oh Erica.; Ah the classic 🫤; Fuck Erica.; She’s right tho.

Now I’m on much more of a buy and hold strategy but that has switched to $ONON

I learned chasing is the dumbest thing to do.; That looks like a pretend company; In hindsight you may be correct but there is a historical precedent where fabs are a bit undervalued for what they do.  Personally, I find it interesting that the chip designers have been the big winners.  I never would have expected that a decade ago.  There is also that looming problem with China which may be a big nothing burger and make that PE incredibly low…or something might happen that in retrospect was quite obvious.; OnlyFans IPO when; Military stocks after Trump admin drafts your kids to go die in the Middle East lmao; They love Cava and Sweetgreen.; Data centers & prisons; It’s game over; Me too.

We even took them to see T-Swift in Spain this past summer.; Kids, mang.; She's actually very attractive - I'm a stud, obviously. She is incredibly fit, Google Engineer (The real kind), and works out every day, and she loves to fish... $18 million would definitely give you a good shot.; nah man. Wasn't like that.

Accurate; lol life; Fair; especially 15 years later lmao; damn u guys dont hold back at alllll; Hypothetically speaking, she could realize how the grass is not always greener on the other side like so many women tend to think, and that her materialistic ass could have had everything she thought she was going to get by leaving him. 

A possibility. No idea why they divorced.; Not pictured: Him messaging this fact every second day for years.; Coulda had VIP tickets if you had somehow held onto the NVDA lol; Maybe you should marry her; ""Kids now"" makes it sound like you made them after the divorce.; Thats good because all Taylor Swift's songs are about breaking up.; Are/were either of you in a serious relationship afterward?; I guess while separation people give the reason that ""people change"", but that's exactly the reason they should rethink the separation thought too.

I am offering hypothetical answers as to how she could find transformative meaning within that information. I have witnessed this phenomena of women leaving men throughout my life. It is part of life because women select partners who are across and above their dominance hierarchy, men select partners that are across and down in the dominance hierarchy. Generally speaking.

Time in the market beats timing the market. Ignore the noise and let it cook. ,No content,https://i.redd.it/sho39lft2k4e1.jpeg,199,2024-12-03 04:49:30,"Let Tim Cook*; Over the time I’ve owned AAPL, I’ve ridden out Trump’s trade war in 2018, the COVID crash of 2020, the inflation correction of 2022, along with a couple disappointing quarters and hundreds of finance ‘articles’ warning about iPhone shipments declining.

It’s easy to get entranced by the market‘s daily ups and downs and constant recession fears. Especially when you’re new to this. When you’re long term investing, you do no need to check the market every 15 minutes. You don’t even need to do it weekly in my opinion. If you can find a stock with a good business model, good growth, and good cash flow, ignore the pundits and stick with it until something fundamentally changes with the company.

  
No one can reliably predict crashes anyway.; 100% correct, I never understand why so many individuals are in the business of buying a good stock and then selling for whatever reason. 

If it's a good company literally just hold, DCA, and buy big dips and it'll keep going up.; Absolutely I just had this argument (ahem conversation) about a stock in a new technology that grew quickly, then dropped. I believe in them for the long haul. So 25% up and a 15% down in a few months. If they continue to be successful and grow as I suspect… it will be just a blip on the way to a strong long term company. If not.. well it won’t be the last time I waste money on an idea.

Not trying to bag on you but six months from now this picture can look drastically different.; As someone who worked in the financial sector for a few years and worked alongside some really great bright and responsible people going to r/wallstreetbets made me kinda sick to my stomach.  Imagine kids believing that shit. I’ve done everything the right way and currently looking at 7mm at retirement. Came from nothing. ; Wow.

I've never heard that phrase. Ever.

My phone arrived with a non-functional rear camera and I haven’t had a good iPhone since the 14 pro max. I know very few American iPhone users anymore, and most I know are also switching. My keyboard disappears randomly and auto correct isn’t functional.; It’s a mistake I made myself when starting out. In 2013 I sold AMZN and NFLX to lock in a few hundred dollars of profit. I could have been up about 1500% on them, all I had to do was nothing!

I think we’re all emotional about money. I know I have a lot of anxiety about financial security from my upbringing. Long term investing forced me to overcome some of those fears, and those lessons were learned the hard way. ; Well but it depends on the stock really. For etfs, sure. But even a Microsoft or apple might drop one day. So depending on when you enter the market, at some point you might have to sell one or the other stock.; Most people are desperate and want an easy fix for their lives. That’s why crypto exploded and sports betting is now getting huge. It’s a sign of the times and falling faith in the financial system.

My Dad is a retired rocket scientist and grandfather (in law) was high up in Lockheed as a chief structural engineer.

|-|-|-|-|; Unless you’re cashing out today, today’s value of your unrealized gains is pretty irrelevant.; I'm curious how the EVTOL industry would do anything except replace helicopters tbh. I see the value with replacing a helicopter with a more capable, maneuverable electric vtol but I see no world where these dramatically increase traffic in the sky?; You are correct. Any single day is irrelevant. That’s kinda my point, did you not read the original comment I made with this post?; I’m not expecting the jetson’s or 5th element kinda sky travel anytime soon. 

I’ve spent too much time in my FIL’s private plane to think the FAA is ready for that anytime soon. The public doesn’t want midair collisions raining down on their houses. Outcry would be insane. 

But I spent time talking with my dad over the weekend. He’s a retired rocket scientist NASA and worked with military air and defense tech his entire career (Silicon Valley) . I showed him 3 companies in eVOLT. So he gave ideas and thoughts about viability of the companies and the industry in general. The military has been looking towards a fast, cheaper and safer small helicopter for awhile. 

He looked at HOVR, ACHR and JOBY.

The areas he was most interested and enthusiastic about for this new niche product…yep… niche. 

They are similar cost to buy, but cheaper to run and maintain.  The learning curve appears to be lower to fly safely and master. Helicopters are tough. Safety overall is sounding better too. The electric aspect makes it easier to recharge out in the middle of nowhere compared to gas. Solar, battery charging basics…off grid can work. 

Private ownership-commute to and from a job for the wealthy. Taxis within big cities to get from say Manhattan to airport. Oil fields and oil platforms transport. (Think Middle East and Texas where roads are long or inaccessible), Medical- basically ambulance for critical, organ transport and where there are care desserts far from hospitals (also think Doctors Without Borders kinda stuff), war time-these are very quiet, times of natural disasters (imagine the recent NC hills and relief efforts), off grid living (think Alaska, Montana, developing countries) 

So while the flying skys filled with these is pretty far off… they have a real opportunity to take some significant market."

AAPL is one of my biggest life misses on building generational wealth.  I owned $10k of AAPL in 2004, half of it on margin, which I realize is ridiculous because it was all I had but I had conviction that this company was the “next big thing” out of college.  

Welp, I ended up selling it off to do life things like buy a car, furniture and get married.

Do you hold onto the stock until retirement? My mindset is that it’s good to have an emergency fund but you should also live a little. Tomorrow isn’t promised so if you plan on saving forever then someone else will eventually spend your lifetime savings for you.

Hope they burn to the ground honestly.; Pretty much my case, I went to a cheap college so my parents gave me 20k they planned for it that I didn't use. I was a film student and film students had apple computers so I told him to put 18k of it in Apple at around $100 a share (equivalent to around $4 today after all the splits), had about 4,200 shares and used half of them to buy a decent house a few years ago and kept the other half for long term.

I just knew making 7.50$ and hour and working all week to buy 5 shares every Friday seemed like a lost cause......I wanted to buy 5k shares of a 1$ company and my dad told me straight......why don't you buy apple?

It’s hard I know, I almost cashed out to put a bigger down payment on a house to avoid PMI in 2001. 
Bottom line just let it ride….; I have 25 shares btw; When a stock price reaches a certain high point, the company elects to split the stock to make the price more affordable.

I just work for them because I'm an europoor; You’d be surprised how many Apple employees actively choose not to invest in the stock purchase program.; Actually the splits and reinvestments have brought it to 13,172 shares, but who's counting. I'm no longer reinvesting since I don't need more Apple. Today it hit 239.50.; Of course there is reason to sell. To collect profit while it's still that high since nobody knows what will happen.; Yup, stupid me. Sitting on 30 shares now and will just keep slowly adding until I retire in 10-15 years; What do indices consist of?; [deleted]; Owning one of the largest international corporations is gambling?; If this is your view on stocks, why not just invest in treasuries instead?; That’s the mental battle I’ve dealt with - the “what if” scenario.  In reality at the time, I would have sold the shares after hitting the $1M mark, especially right out of university because it was a number.  But I play this fantasy game in my head where I say “what if I just let it ride?”

Life lesson, I suppose.  Regardless, I have to go to work tomorrow 🙈; I mention this often, but I am still here.  And still here working at a full time job to fund my retirement plan 🙈; For one I’m 52 and I need to start putting all of these individual stocks into ETFs that are in my IRA. Apple is at an all time high and need to transition from aggressive to more stable holdings. I also have FTEC which has APPL as a holding. This only represents 13% of my IRA.; Oh I see, I will look at it. Thanks!!; Can you pick me up some chicken stock while you’re there?; La tienda de valores; My grandpa sold one of his companies around 30 years ago for around 100 million dollars. He has put almost all of that into safe and secure stocks from what I’ve heard. All he has done so far is buy a house and is still driving the same Lexus from 30 years ago. Hasn’t helped anyone in our family really and hasn’t bought anything for himself or my grandma. They eat out everyday and occasionally go on a small trip. We don’t have a functioning family at all and no one talks to each other. I never understood why he didn’t just live the life he wanted since the family members won’t probably see any of his money. My grandma also is a lunatic and has an aneurysm at anything he tries to do. He did try and buy a fishing boat a long time ago and my grandma freaked out and made him sell it. She said being on the water is too dangerous. From what I gather my grandma is an ocd party pooper so if my grandpa tries to buy something it just gets shut down from her. I guess he’s just stuck with all this wealth and can’t really do anything with it. I’ve never received or asked anything from them.; probably around $6.5 mill; A little under 2000 left worth nearly half a mil; [removed]; Yeah, he’ll go back over ten years because he had the foresight to take a screenshot to share on Reddit today.; And a dash of luck; Bruh I buy a good bit of mine every buy/sell period.; Why though? They understand the interworkings of their company more than the average person…

Why am I even being downvoted? I thought it was common to buy stock in the company you work, its a huge part of the culture in four out of the five jobs ive had… odd.; I worked for a big blue chip company that had a great stock plan.  It was literally free money, but there were employees who said no thanks.; Well I don’t think anybody would criticize selling half to lock in 49k of profit.; Or sell options... Tax efficient and potentially make more money... Wish I had at least 100 shares...; Why do you speak with such certainty of things you don't understand?; The good ones know…; Obviously we all know the answer. The issue is individual stocks are gambling. Indexes are typically cap weighted and you can own essentially the entire country or world.

r/bogleheads; The riskiest risk is the one you can’t see coming. We’ve all heard of companies that were once on top and thought never able to fall.; Not per se, its just extremely risky to have all your money in one place. Diversity is automatic risk management.; Because index funds produce higher returns than treasuries?; I did the same with bitcoin, sold my share to go towards the deposit for my house. 

I did it because it was the sensible thing to do at the time, just like it was for you.

My mortgage is a little more than I was paying rent so it's a bit harder to save for investments now.; Got it makes sense. Just curious why SCHD vs say VOO? Obviously less risk / fluctuation, but curious if any other reasoning behind it.; [deleted]; *heap; Ya all can buy stocks through the company?; I worked there and invested. Helped pay for college. Plenty of my coworkers didn’t. Not everyone invests in themselves and the places they reside.; It's a very fair point, but I don't see selling half very soon. I may sell a smaller percentage, however, in order to begin distribution. I'm in my 80's.; Literally said nobody knows what will happen; Lol; It’s unfortunate that you’re being downvoted for speaking the truth. But another truth is that fundamental analysis on companies and buying and holding good valuations for extremely long periods of time is not gambling. 

Secondly, 0 dte SPX options with heavy size is by definition, gambling. 

You see how there are ways to be “safe” with individual stocks and risky with indices? There are many different ways to use the market….; Because there is a risk premium.; I’m doing neither!; Yeah its a private company.

Question about buying options,"Hi it is my first time buying options, I have 640 shares of Apple calls 220$ 20/12 I paid 1.544€/share and the option price is now 1.77€/share I would like to ask how much money would earn if I exercise the option? Why the option price is not higher like, 15€, since Apple is now at 235$?

The price of an option is theoretically the intrinsic value of its derivative, and while it is correlated, it does not increase by the same absolute amount. The profit of an option can be calculated by a set formula, since this is a call option, the profit would simply be (ST-K)*number of contracts - the cost of the call options.

Please go read a book before dabbling in options, what you are doing is not investing, it is gambling.; Yeah, I think you are in the wrong sub unless you want to talk about passive investing.

Also, what do you mean by 640 shares? An option is a derivative of the underlying asset, a contract for the right to buy (in the case of call options), the underlying asset at a price (the strike) before an expiration date (itm calls may be execised automatically upon expiration). Each contract is 100 shares, so idk where you are getting 640 from. Did you buy 640 contracts?; Is this the 220 Strike for 20 December? I see 18.15 for the bid with my broker.

It’s gambling, that’s all it is, even if you make money, you’ll just end up eventually loosing it. This sub reddit is for more “adult investing” if you want to do options trading go to r/wallstreetbets. Secondly, I’d recommend using a brokerage that will allow you to actually see and simulate your returns, Robinhood has that feature. But again, stay away please; You sell the option contract - you don't exercise the option contract generally. 

Also - are you sure you actually have listed Apple option contracts? You said - 1.544€/share

Apple llisted contracts are quoted in USD. And they are not shares. 

What are you actually trading? Is sounds like maybe you are trading something else other than US listed Apple options.

Technology and its effect on stock market average returns. Does the future hold higher average returns?,"I know, I know.......I know. NO ONE knows what the market will do other than it will go up, down or sideways.

But I feel like we live in a different world now than we did the past numerous decades. Everyone has access to investing. Right in the palm of their hands. Virtually anyone anywhere can invest in any market they wish from their phone. Historical returns are 7 percent (inflation adjusted) based on old technology, processes, access and education on finance. It is no longer the days of old where tie wearing NYSE brokers answer their rotary phones screaming about deals and brokering deals for end user. It was a whole process and really, you NEEDED someone to strike the deals for you and in most cases, suggest what funds to invest in since there was no internet to self educate or even research companies to invest in.

Nowadays with giants like Fidelity, Vanguard and others offering index funds that take all of the thought and most of the choice and a lot of the risk out of the equation. I don't need to ask a broker which SP500 fund to buy. I don't need a broker to strike deals for me. I don't even need to make a call or have a person do ANYTHING for me.

I am not a crypto investor, I am a naysayer in fact. But I cannot deny the effect that crypto has had on investing. It has done a LOT to make investing mainstream, if not even trendy. There were always hedge funds and major investors but now regular consumers are taking part and making retail a MUCH bigger player. Retail tripled almost instantly in 2020 and participation has remained high.

Almost all of the hurdles have been removed between the investor and the investment with technology. There is little to understand/learn and is done anywhere, any time for convenience. Not a fan of robinhood but apps like this have put the keys to investing directly into the end users hands.

Now that investing is automatically diversified, exceptionally well returning index funds are in the palm of everyone's hand, consider that the US stock market is the economic powerhouse of the world. Anyone anywhere for the most part can invest in US stock market. This is appealing to anyone in a lesser financial climate (Japan). Now that the wealth gluttons have their claws in every last corner of US government, I don't see them doing anything but moves to further bolster financial and economic markets. The US stock market is the harvesting field of the elite wealth gluttons.

My personal thoughts though as I said, I am aware NO ONE can predict the stock market. But it feels poised to redefine ""average returns"" and with the near future political climate.....if it doesn't get completely blown up (unlikely) I think future returns will far exceed 7 percent as long as the USA remains the economic powerhouse that it is",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h2ppqn/technology_and_its_effect_on_stock_market_average/,22,2024-11-29 17:35:52,"I’m just going to put right here that it’s going to be unclear if the world has really changed involving stocks until we get past 2030 probably.

The reason why returns are not that high is because there are numerous secular bear markets over the years that have below average returns. The last one was 2000-2009 (or maybe even up to 2013 depending on how you judge). 

It’s just not going to be clear that those have gone by the way of the dodo for another number of years.; Aerotyne; Your argument doesn't match the historical record.

The role of financial institutions in controlling the volume and direction of money flow in the market only began in the late 1950's. ""Retail"", aka individual investors, were the driving force behind the stock market prior to that. Yet valuation multiples along P/E, P/S, P/FCF, etc. as well as market returns were not elevated during this previous period either.; If GDP grows at 3% YoY, can the SP500 maintain 13% YoY?; Retail investors still don’t have that significant of an impact on stocks, most money is moved through billion dollar fund algorithms not me or you trading on robinhood. Also, retail investing is fine now when unemployment is down and the economy is somewhat okay, in a recession I would expect more downward volatility as consumers are more easily manipulated - you could maybe argue that there would be higher highs but then there would also be lower lows.; tech valuations have grown much faster than their earnings growth, so no, it is unlikely to return what it has returned historically.


For example Apple was trading at like 12x earnings a decade ago... tech stocks went from being very cheap to very expensive; This is feelings post devoid of facts or statistics. In other words a shit post.; The present has higher valuations but lower returns (particularly in US markets)

From the existing (at the time) retail participants. I get what you are saying that but that is kind of my point.

It isn't necessarily WHO is investing, but rather that a lot more dollars are entering the market. Which drives up returns. At no point in history has investing in the stock market been a complete DIY, hassle free experience that requires little to no knowledge and accessible from anyone anywhere in the world. Now ya can

I feel pre 2020 to current is a different investing world. Edit: Downvotes for having a discussion and learning experiences and viewpoints, the reddit way.; Valuations mean nothing when people run imaginary currencies up to 100k a share.; > The future will revert to historical returns

since you're able to tell the future, mind telling me the lottery numbers for next week?; Yeah people are blind to see that investing has changed. It's been on a hyper drive since post covid.; > I don't feel that the ""historical record"" applies in the advent of new technology which has greatly increased participation and ease.

The history of economic development is nothing more than the continual introduction of new technological cycles. This includes services that increase the ease of retail participation. So why should we expect higher-than-average returns indefinitely when your primary justification is something that has been occurring for literally hundreds of years? Innovations and permissive legal changes helped fuel the Mississippi bubble, the Wyoming cattle boom, the Roaring 20's, etc. The latter two had intense speculative inflows from international investors as well.

As I said, the crux of why your thesis is based on assumptions. You're relying on stereotypes of the stock market and vague optimism instead of actual data.  

> It isn't necessarily WHO is investing, but rather that a lot more dollars are entering the market. Which drives up returns.

If the core of your operating thesis was true, we would see a constant acceleration in CAGR over the lifespan of the stock market. Pull up any chart and you'll see this isn't the case. Note that the introduction of seminal new technologies like the personal computer have neither boosted productivity or GDP in the way enthusiasts originally envisioned either.

Over time, stock market returns are mathematically bounded. Ease of participation doesn't exert meaningful long-term upside pressure.

> At no point in history has investing in the stock market been a complete DIY, hassle free experience that requires little to no knowledge and accessible from anyone anywhere in the world.

We can expect worse crashes as well if this holds true.; No doubt, my entire post is speculation and hopium. As charged, I pull no punches about that.

Never, ever has the entire planet had direct access to any investment they want and the ability to research to the worlds end. That is my entire point.

You are clearly more educated in the history of the stock market than I and yes, historical data is all we have to go on sometimes. I will definitely be researching some of the events and timelines you mentioned. Fascinating stuff. I am personally hoping for bigger returns moving forward so my ""not enough"" fun becomes enough to retire.

RemindMe! 20 years; > Never, ever has the entire planet had direct access to any investment they want and the ability to research to the world's end. That is my entire point.

Remember, they said the internet would usher in a transformative era of self-education and knowledge too. The flip side is there's a lot of bad data and incentive to get retail invested regardless of market conditions. 

> I will definitely be researching some of the events and timelines you mentioned. Fascinating stuff. I am personally hoping for bigger returns moving forward so my ""not enough"" fun becomes enough to retire.

Over time the aggregate stock market will go up, and there's always a bull market in some subsector. But understanding which part of the market cycle you're in is essential to preserving hard-won principal."

Old IRA very overweight in two equities - opinions please.,"I have an IRA from an old job that has grown to a balance of $700,000.  The “issue” is $425,000 of this balance is made up of AAPL and MSFT.  I bought a decent amount of shares in this account years ago and didn’t touch them.  Got lucky basically.  I’ve been considering selling the majority of the balance in these two stocks to move it to a SP500 fund (VOO).  I feel like I already know what the correct answer is but wanted to see some takes on this topic.  Thanks in advance for any responses.  

My concern is AAPL and MSFT will keep beating SP500 returns but there is a lot of risk in keeping these two positions.  I remember Enron, Worldcom, etc.

If it is to outperform the market and you are willing to accept more risk to do so, leave as is.  If the goal is to reduce risk through diversifying and keep pace with the market, trade to an index fund.  If the goal becomes even less risk/volatility then find appropriate percentages of bond funds or fixed interest to add to the index fund.  Clearly defined goals for the account help to guide wise trading decisions 👍🏻; Just sell it and rebuy VT or VTI/VXUS or equivalent funds from other brokers.  AAPL and MSFT will be within the Top 5 stocks held in most diversified funds; Yes, obviously sell most of it - but maybe sell all of it and put it in QQQM instead of VOO, if you want to remain tech heavy but have more diversity and still own a big chunk of AAPL & MSFT.; You could start by selling your original position and transferring that amount to VOO. That way, everything left in MSFT & APPL is essentially house money. That relieves the pressure of having to do something.; You can sell without it being a taxable event in a tax advantaged account (traditional or Roth IRA). So if you wanted to sell some of those shares and get some VOO you absolutely can. ; You should also be in r/Bogleheads. lots us are here as well.; It's an ira so cap gains are a non issue. Sell those shares at market and toss it all in voo once the funds settle. If you want some heavier tech exposure you can buy something like qqq or fngs but yeah having more than 5% of your portfolio in a single company is dumb and should be avoided unless it would cause big cap gains.; Funny that no one has asked your age. I'm going to assume you're in your 40's.

Both Apple and Microsoft are excellent tech stocks that will continue to grow long term. I would hold on to them.

You can diversify by putting *additional* funds into VOO etc.; Rebalancing is the low risk choice. Go for it.

You'll still have portfolio exposure 7% AAPL and 6.18% MSFT in an SP500 etf, so if they keep going up you're golden.; Sell the AAPL and MSFT and buy VOO. You’ll still have exposure to AAPL and MSFT upside.; [deleted]; MSFT is still rated a buy - maybe keep some of that?

Maybe sell some call options instead of just selling at today's price?  Keep selling more as they expire. As some get assigned, Once you've sold what you need to you're done with options.; Your weight shouldn’t impact your investment plans.; Sell covered calls until they get called away.; Not sure I'd worry about either company reaching Enron level of incompetence, but both companies are at risk of reaching their growth ceiling in the next decade and it's easy to imagine them stagnating in 20ish years. 

If you're still young then $700k in VOO/VTI should set you up for retirement even if your contributions are minimal over the next couple decades.; Suggest VTI +VXUS but yes; You know the answer. 

Don’t have more than 5% in any one stock.; Overweight is a myth. Your 401k is not an index with limitations on position size relative to portfolio size. In the last five years, Apple is up almost 300% and Microsoft is up almost 200% while the S&P 500 is up only 100%. Being overweight in two excellent stocks has returned more than twice the S&P 500. Why would you sell at this point? Are you thinking that the S&P 500 is going to outperform either Apple or Microsoft?

If you are worried about the volatility of either position, you can put in a stop loss at 5 to 10% below the current price on both stocks. This will limit your loss and risk. Don don’t chase mediocre performance. Let your winners run.; 250 cash* 250 etfs 200 stocks like apple msft amazon meta 50 more interesting picks like space, air taxis, drones, medical innovations, quantum computing. Simples.

*reasonably high chance of a crash incoming.; Overweight is a myth. Your 401k is not an index with limitations on position size relative to portfolio size. In the last five years, Apple is up almost 300% and Microsoft is up almost 200% while the S&P 500 is up only 100%. Being overweight in two excellent stocks has returned more than twice the S&P 500. Why would you sell at this point? Are you thinking that the S&P 500 is going to outperform either Apple or Microsoft?

If you are worried about the volatility of either position, you can put in a stop loss at 5 to 10% below the current price on both stocks. This will limit your loss and risk. Don don’t chase mediocre performance. Let your winners run.; [removed]; Yes another solid way to think about it.  Thank you.; Yeah it’s hard to take emotion out of it but reading some of these responses is helping.  Thanks.; Yeah I’m mid 40s.  My other 401k and Roth IRA are SP500 heavy.  I ended up selling $200k of AAPL today and kept the Microsoft for now.  It was nice of everyone to respond seeing opinions in writing is helpful.; Yeah seeing it in writing makes it clearer and easier to make the move.  These stocks have done so well for me it’s hard to enter the sell order for the majority of my shares but as you state VOO is still a high % of these two firms.  Thanks for the response.; You can also move to a tech-focused ETF. That might be a good compromise. Instead of owning 2 companies, it’ll be closer to 4-5, but that’s still a big step in diversification and there is regular rebalancing.; Yeah I sold a large chunk of the AAPL this morning and will keep the MSFT for a bit longer.  Thanks for the response.; Yeah I’m mid 40s…I have my regular 401k and a Roth IRA as well.; No thanks.; So you were already diversified? I don't see the point of selling AAPL then.; Another advantage you have is that it’s in an IRA.  You could sell all the stock and put it in VOO then decide two weeks later to go back with zero tax consequences.

If you’re having FOMO you need to reconcile that any gains you miss out on is the price you’re willing to pay for the resilience of diversification.; AAPL and MSFT still make up a high % of my total portfolio considering all accounts.  MSFT is lagging the SP500 performance this year and AAPL had a great 6 month run to catch up to the SP500.  Without a crystal ball it’s hard to say if these two companies will continue to beat the US market just wanted to see some opinions here.  It does feel right to me just to further increase my SP500 position by selling a chunk of each.; Keep in mind AAPL and MSFT make up \~13% of the S&P500 when you calculate your portfolio allocations.

"r/Stocks Daily Discussion & Fundamentals Friday Nov 29, 2024","This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on fundamentals, but if fundamentals aren't your thing then just ignore the theme.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

It soared from 19% to just under 30%. Now you'd think, well you have Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, surely it's going to create competitive pressure. No, [it has continued to rise to 38%](https://i.imgur.com/wtH4QFj.jpeg), as the company extends the longevity of its hardware and continues to benefit from economies of scale ([source](https://x.com/borrowed_ideas/status/1852157389602246717) from X). [All the while raw sales grow quite steadily](https://i.imgur.com/QE9YdtD.png). Granted, [Google is catching up](https://i.imgur.com/SxYMNlr.png) [graph from Mostly Borrowed Ideas], so this shows that the industry is so huge that there is still space for AMZN, GOOG, MSFT, without any kind of erosion of margins.

AMZN is a proven leader in creating entire new industries and turning them into giants. [From X](https://x.com/RihardJarc/status/1861752430507012428), graph of [some segments](https://i.imgur.com/B2ipYuw.jpeg) in particular. In text form:

>Ads 2019 - $12.6B; Ads 2024 - $53.6B

Yes, they do a ton of capex, but at least they have demonstrated a very strong ROI and capability to create/enter/destroy incumbents in new industries.

Imo, rather than  whining about Apple/MSFT being expensive and implying this extends to all tech, maybe the most obvious longs are staring right at you with  AMZN (+ Google).; Say what you want but people convincing buying PLTR, SOFI, RKLB, HIMS when they're all up 200-300% on average reminds me of the 2021 period. No doubt they're good companies but surely a correction has to come at some point.; GOOG below 170 klaxon!; Meta just announced a massive infrastructure project to future proof their business.

Investors are gonna punish the shit out of them.; Too late to get in on RKLB? I am holding a fair chunk of cash that I usually just regularly DCA into FWRG, but looking to take a few punts now, only everything is ATH and nothing is looking like a bargain.; Wedbush with a $300 PT on AAPL while Barclay sees it at $184.

You could fit GOOGL in that valuation gap...; How did everyone do today? I didnt finish quite as strong as I started this morning. Bought some Nu dip. Holding a bit more cash then I’d like currently but having a hard time finding places to deploy it.; I never realized this but once your stocks go up the rate of going up also increases! One of my stocks went up by 13% today which is a good move. But because my buy price is so low it was essentially +50% jump for me! Absolutely crazy. Unfortunately when if it falls I'll be in pain but until then I'll enjoy looking at these numbers lol.; 600 looks like the upper bound for SPY today, put interest is evenly distributed from 595-600.; I’m up 400% on my APP position in 3.5 months.

It’s a high quality company but starting to feel a little too good to be true; Any black Friday stocks on sale? Lol; It's been a very good 2 weeks for $TLT.  I know this is a reddit stock group, but with stocks at ATH's; this is a very good time to just buy treasuries and chill.; MBLY went from $11 to $19 and instead of shorts closing when they were in profit, they just opened more shorts and called for lower prices (eg. BOA securities), 23.4% of float shorted: https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/MBLY/short-interest/; UMAC on a tear.; Foot Locker had significant hidden options flow over the last week (more than $300k), and it broke the 50-day EMA on Wednesday. Looks like people are positioning themselves ahead of earnings.

Carvana has the hallmarks of a short squeeze next week.  

Energy Fuels got a nice headwind after Madagascar's government lifted its suspension on the Toliara project. UUUU is seeking to add rare earth minerals to the mining permit.; Wtf happened with HIMS? Last I heard they were down on Amazon entering the space. Now they’re hitting ATHs every day.; someone somewhere said today would be a low volume day but it doesnt seem that way.; $NU and $MELI down sharply at the open, dont see news

Edit: Found it: ""Shares of Brazilian financial companies fell as the government proposed to increase taxes on high-income earners and expand tax exemptions for lower-income earners. The Brazilian real hit an all-time low of 6.02 per dollar.""; New ATH today.; It really feels 2021 again. We keep grinding higher and higher with extreme valuation. Wonders if it will reverse in 2025?; Until the tariff issue is resolved, tankers and shippers will continue to crash. I would stay away for now, but keep an eye on the good companies with depressed multiples.; ""Fundamentals"" Friday lol.

Ill start: AAPL has small revenue growth and profit growth and thus it trades at 38 PE. ""Fundamentals""; Nice -4% day on EVVTY. Great job; 6,100 here we come, baby.; Definitely some monthly rebalancing going on w those closing swings. Dow stocks got bit. Sbux got the rip.; What's the best online forum for stocks /stock pickers? I love reddit but want to keep an open mind to the best discourse available; New ath for the main fruit company. What's more richly valued nvda at 3.5 or aapl at 3.6T; [deleted]; What are you guys thinking about SPY movement for next week?; My portfolio performance:

Bottom 10: https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/s/eDDhggzfdK

Top 8: https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/s/05S0oBhZC9; Yo u/CosmicSpiral , you mentioned POET a few weeks back, I added it to my watchlist, it's up 40% since, had I bought it it would have been my largest gainer this year easy. Nice work mate!; New ATH. Let's get to 6100.

Santa rally; forgot market closes at 1 pm et today.; Took stakes in SYM, CE, MRNA this week. Added to BIDU.; New ath for costco; What do you all think of Ge Vernova as a long term play; Is it even worth buying mag 7 individually if you have an ETF like VOO?; I would love to add my 3 month xmas bonus into QQQ but man does it not feel toppy; I sold half of my position in IONQ, and dumped it into 7dte SPY calls for next week. So that's my full portfolio right now. The bull market has just begun. I expect another 50% jump from IONQ this coming week. I expect SPY to hit $620 next week. I already made enough to retire, but at this rate why not keep making more money. NFA; Really wouldn’t be surprised at all if we get handed a red day in semiconductors after there was a light relief bounce worldwide while the US was closed.; So yet another perfect V from Wednesday. Shocker, another ATH in the SPY. QQQ on it's way. And yet I keep getting criticized for saying that this market will never go down and will continue to make V after V when that is all that it does.; Is buying prison stocks, such as GEO orCXW a good choice?; Any interesting stock tips? I just DCA into the S&P500 but would like to look into individual stocks; I need help with a strategy. As a college student, I haven’t started investing a ton of money. I’ve got about 3k in my account. That said, I’m not too worried about losses right now. I’ve been selling whenever I hit 10%+ on a stock, depending on the momentum. My highest growth right now is IonQ, SoFi, Palantir, and Redwire. Are any of these absolute holds? I’d hate to look back in a couple decades and be disappointed; A lot of equipment names are having a strong day ; What is green; Holiday miracle.; Lol ooof; That's right, from a more informal perspective, from what I have heard from people in this industry AWS is as ingrained in how companies, banks and governments (point being they won't migrate) run that we could mention it could be mentioned in the same breath as MSFT.

I can absolutely see them as being the most valuable company in the world someday.; Both can be true. Most of tech can be expensive while AMZN and GOOG; Welp, I own GOOG, AMZN and MSFT, so I think this bodes well.; Yup we call this rule don't chase; Yeah but can’t one argue if they plan to hold any company for 5-10 years then it doesn’t really matter?

RKLB is my second biggest holding rn and not using it as a short term thing; I agree, but remember that Thiel bought the country's new VP. sooo no stopping that one now.; Surely; They've been punished enough.; Infrastructure project as in blackwell chips?; I bought a very small position at $20 on Nov. 13 so I'm up 36% already  


Not many people would have recommended buying at that time but everything seems to be just going up. 


It is getting kind of ridiculous so play with caution. ; Compounded gains much faster that compound interest; Compounding; It’s your money, so do what you want with it, but I’ve learned to take profit when things go up like that. ; It's overvalued, but not so overvalued that a severe correction is imminent.

If you haven't divested any of your original position, you can shave off 25-35%.; Options collar; I've sold all but 25% of my position now. It's a competitive industry and all the easy multiple expansion gains are pretty much over unless you're betting on it becoming as expensive as say TTD. (on a multiple basis; it has easily cruised past TTD's market cap) I personally have not done enough due diligence to know something about their forward earnings that the market doesn't know (anymore). Up to you about selling off, but imo trimming is absolutely the right move. 400% gains are quite rare and we know the market can swiftly punish that in an instant.; Im only keeping it to see if it becomes a 10bagger for me at this point.  I trimmed enough to make back my original amount.; So good betting on the government adding 1 trillion in debt every few months; I'm staying away from bonds.  I can see Trump's policy destroying the dollar and Bonds even further.  My portfolio which is mostly composed of SPY is barely keeping up with the housing market in California.  Goes to show most of these gains are due to the devaluation of the dollar.; Disagree - inflation going in the wrong direction…and this is before the apartment supply will dry up like a cactus in the desert (maybe a late 2025/2026 story); Don't know much about this company. Why so much short interest?; Brazilian reais just hit an all time low value vs the dollar, if I had to guess why. Most of their revenue comes from brazil.

  
edit: fuck I made this post before the edit showed for me b/c my tab had been opened for a few minutes already; Why would an income tax affect them that much? Especially on high earners.; You would need to got the Oracle of Delphi to get an answer to that question. The real actionable question is if you are positioning yourself to either be mentally ok or portfolio wise stable should a reversal happen?; Yes in some ways it does and in other ways it doesn’t. Someone seems to say this every day lately. It’s kind of hard to have a realistic discussion about the state of the market when people have been saying this in one form or another the last couple of years, right through amazing buying opportunities. People who believe the market on the whole is overvalued often point to one or two metrics and ignore everything else and act as though they know something everyone else doesn’t and don’t want to hear any other opinions, so the discussion gets fatigued.

I don’t think the market has gotten anywhere near as wild as peak 2021 madness yet. Keep looking for value, or stick with your bets and tune out, or if you like you can place a modest bet against the market if you think the opportunity is there. There is money to be made both directions in the market.; It felt like 21 earlier this year. Now it feels like 99; Thanks for bringing that up. I used to own INSW and LPG, but it's been a while. Haven't been keeping up with their movements; What ones would you say are the good companies? Any buy targets for them?; I dont own any aapl... no one is forcing you to either; Nothing stopping it from trading at a 50 pe currently; [deleted]; It is at decade low here on multiples, growth also slowed since then though... I keep buying it keeps dropping, last Q was pretty decent so surprised it closed the gap; These guys have a ton of debt or something?; None.; Twitter if you're selective. I get most of my ideas and datapoints I missed there. Then I come and share them here occasionally (the non-micro caps at least). 

It's also fun to know that I'm DMing with someone who had a $20M+ position in this coal company I have a few thousand in lol.; This is honestly a tough one. NVDA's is in the 'over-earning' stage so it appears cheaper than it actually is. It's going to be a mad rush to the exits when the cycle turns. Apple is expensive but I see it as more reliable source of cash flows in the near future. I'd probably still buy NVDA over Apple today, but exit fairly quickly, preferring AAPL long term. [But I'd rather buy neither of them]; Apple. Nvidia has the growth to back it up. 

I'm not invested in either; Check out their debt situation.; It will go from left to right, that much I can tell you.; Thanks. I missed out on the surge too, but I'm still bullish on the company and will start buying shares next month.; No management fees and it allows you to swing trade a bit more. If one of the mag 7 that you really like gets some negative news (google) and goes down, the etf might not even go down.; I buy some of mag 7 and don't hold etfs; Not all mag7 are equal; Depends how concentrated you want to be in them vs the rest of the S&P 493; 🎰; What’s the position if you don’t mind sharing; Doubt it due to export controls being less than expected, semi equip bouncing in Europe ; Curious to know if you're shorting? I see the same comment abt Semis from you everyday lol.; It will keep happening until it doesn't.; Imo the window to profit in a meaningful way on them has passed and I'm surprised they aren't going back down more. I'm doubtful any of the Trump deportation promises will pan out anyways.; It’s a really vague question so hard to answer. I would start out with very large caps, companies you like, and that have a future in an emerging technology.; I posted my holdings recently. I'm long on everything but Costco, which I may dabble in again at some point. If you have questions on any of my picks I'd gladly answer; You shouldn't be selling so quickly. Sure it's 300 bucks or maybe a bit more, but that is also taxable income now. If the 3k is something you need soon or are afraid to lose, I'd suggest VOO since it's safer than individual stocks. With a solid investment in VOO, you'll have a foundation to rely on investing something in individual stocks. Again it really depends on if losing 3k or most of it is an issue for you. 

In terms of whether these stocks are absolute holds, nobody here knows. People can be right about a stock, but we have no idea what will happen in a year or five or ten. Even great stocks can drop for a bit and then rise to new all time highs.; Better than feared export control news, Tokyo Electron and europe names did well yesterday while we were closed; Would make more sense than NVDA or AAPL.; I think this opinion works more with Tesla and Elon tbh, but if we actually don’t get continuation by the Nasdaq and have semis weigh it down next year, then maybe it’ll block Tesla from doing something stupid like going to $500-510 before Elon and Trump have a falling out. 

Anyway, I’ve made my concerns well known, but I think your most likely case is that tech just continues to be dragged higher to mid February, kicking and screaming while small caps outperform bigly, then mid February is likely just about the top of the year and semis lead to the Nasdaq getting smashed down.

Probably big volatility like 2018 was.; Nope lol they aren't allowed to spend money, only print it.; https://www.benzinga.com/media/24/11/42247515/meta-weighs-sole-ownership-of-a-10-billion-subsea-cable-project; Yeah, I’ve been trimming it but am letting some of the original position ride.

Win-win at this point; Yeah I just trimmed it again. 

Curious, what do you feel is the ballpark “fair value share price” of the stock at this point? ; TTD will never justify its valuations. At 145x P/E, it needs its ROA to increase 6x and EPS 7x. The growth rate in both is far too slow to reach those goals even if you stretch out the waiting period past 10 years. 

It's possible for APP with its current earnings power, but everything depends on establishing the e-commerce foothold and scaling it without margin impact.; You're thinking the inflation trend is up in 2025?; In August shorts had gone from 20m+ down to 11m while the stock was at $14.28.

In November the amount of shorts had doubled while price was in the $10-$15 range, and now the price is at $18-$19, so basically all those new shorts are deep underwater (up to 76% losses).; lol, no problem I do the same thing all the time; Perhaps, but the delta between peak 2021 frenzy and the current market is getting narrower and narrower. At some point, the risk/reward just isn’t there; STNG, TEN, TNK, ASC, DLNG

You'll need to track their price movement and find the best levels of support.; i mean, FUNDAFUCKINGMENTALS should stop it from even trading at a 25 PE, let alone a 38 and jesus fucking christ let alone a 50PE.; well yeah were in a market bubble so of course its gonna keep going up for no reason (until it doesnt); I am down 10% from my OG buy, when I bought I thought it was super cheap and that I would set and forget, might need to research again.; Exactly the opposite; It is insane to think about being able to have a direct line to communicate with people who have that much money to invest.; Which coal company is this if you don’t mind sharing 😮; lol; [deleted]; Any specific reason for waiting? Also did you ever end up buying BMY or did that thesis change?; Please please please do not follow my advice. I have went bankrupt before and may go bankrupt again.

I just started throwing common sense out of the window an started doing the opposite of what I would do (inverse myself). The more ridiculous the prediction I have made, the market has produced an even more ridiculous outcome topping mine, over the past month. Im hoping that by betting SPY will go up to 620 this next week, it may go to 650.; That’s the point.

The relief bounce came in Europe. Small gap up and then move lower most likely for this session in the US.; I mean sure. It will keep going up. Unstoppable market.; Bingo. Retail will be left holding the bag.; Some analysts say that they will be good dividend stocks, but I found their surmise based on a very stretching scenario for them.; I’m kicking myself because I saw rocket lab at $8 but it had already gone up a lot by that point so I didn’t invest. I’m trying to get insight on maybe some more potential winners; Thanks for the reply! I’ll take a closer look, do you think nividia still has potential?; You make good points, I suppose I’ll have to think more about it; Also saw this news 

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/japan-earmarks-extra-9-9-080342643.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHDTc5w47l85eAjWnLHzkJKMJ-tlu9-dzeVcU7XlE1Gnhfwzp9WMl72WcChy58oJ6fqP62snjcYrJW1PdMz5dCGsQ20yssinJpTk-fzBRA4OqdcMGv8_oCKXCTUTB3ds2oVE9ExgtH39aWhZVnAJ284x2InRdHcUq5gceMW_9TeE; 10b over ten years? Nothingburger. They blow 5b plus a quarter on vr goggles.; Right now, the UAFRS data says it's trading around 38x P/E. If we exclude the move into e-commerce and focus solely on revenue and margin growth within the gaming sector, we're significantly above fair value on a DCF basis. Earnings would have to reach $18 per share; right now, they're at $6.00 and projected to reach $8 next year.

Whether APP is *unsustainably* overvalued, akin to a competitor like TTD, hinges on the rollout of Axon 2.0 into said new vertical.; Thank you for the info ; Better only VOO for you. Too emotional for the game.; Seems pretty cheap then. Might have to sell some puts on it.; It was BTU or AMR (or a combination) if I remember right. And I may be off by $10M (it could be higher lol).; There's a big push to refinance it, which is keeping the stock down. It's not a Biden/Trump thing as the rest of the sector has run. It's debt thing. There's a bunch of people who write about it on X and Substack.; I'm rebalancing my portfolio. 

Currently considering BMY alongside other companies like MHVFY. Thesis is still the same.; Oh I wasn’t planning to haha, I was just curious as it sounded like something I’d never do. Have you found success going ape like this lol?; All in with puts on SPY, gotcha..

Jk man, I know how that is. Def gives the feeling that you're being watched and they know exactly what you (as the herd) know and can flip the button to snatch your money with their behind the scenes knowledge. 

It's like all the indicators available to the regular guy say it's a left up ahead but MMs know damn well they're turning the wheel right.; Perhaps, I think we are do for a stronger relief rally though tbh, semi equip side has gotten pounded for like months now; I've been thinking that for like 16 straight months but PEs just continue to expand from nosebleed levels to even more nosebleedy levels.; You actually believe that nonsense? I hear the same BS every day. Exit liquidity. Yet it only goes higher and higher.; Be very careful buying companies that have a lot of online hype. Most of what is pumping hard right now are pre-revenue or very early speculative bets. There are plenty of names that went up big in 2021 on the same principles then crashed hard. If you want to essentially gamble on these stocks I would buy just a small amount to get your foot in the door. If/when the market falls these types of stocks will be dirt cheap and you can make a decision which will be a winner and put more in.; Yup yup, I think AI will continue to improve, their hold as leader I think will maintain, and the pace they lose market share I think will be less than the increase in productivity that their contributions to the AI industry will have. So, as market share goes down, I still see valuation rising. Ai is an unprecedented opportunity at increasing value across many industries that I think won't dip back down in a significant way. The dotcom bubble has led investors this time around to be more cautious, and even with that we see with ai improvements in efficiency in so many fields, that the biggest companies need to embrace it in order to keep up with the growth of their competition. Companies that utilize AI do better than their competitors who don't. Blackwell will rock the boat one way or the other, so we'll see eventually. I'm way late on it anyways but I just really believe in what AI is capable of, as a someone distant relative to the stem field; Not trying to be annoying, but it's funny seeing your username, I had something similar like 20 years ago. We all have to keep aging it seems. Like the other reply said, just throw most of your money in a index fund, keep learning, maybe make some small bets on individual stocks over the years, and quit selling winners at 10%; That's what I'm saying, but they killed it with their earnings, but they adjusted their Capex lower limit up by 1b, and the stocked dropped 4-5%  because of it.; I'll keep crushing VOO with my own strategy thanks.; Gotcha, I remember you used to share a lot of info on HCC. Any updates on that if you are still holding?; Gotcha was just wondering as it seemed you were pretty bullish on both mentioned above. Do you not worry about price jumping until you decide to enter in and changing the thesis or are these stocks you have conviction in for long long term? I always begin with a starter position and slowly build due to spikes at least if I have my decision made!; I just got tired of being wrong all the time. Historically ,every time I entered a short position, the stock went on to have its best performance of all time. And every time I entered a long position or bought calls, the stock went on to have its worst performance ever.

For example I bet on google since the big drop in august by buying calls. My calls were destroyed. Common sense would tell you google is the stock to invest in, not rklb or ionq or sofi or any of that junk.

I also bet that the judge would pass jetblue buying save. Turns out the judge was corrupt and rejected the merger and now SAVE is on life support and will eventually go out of business. Market is definitely rigged.

Last year I bought calls on ionq at $19 they then reversed and had the biggest downtrend ever. Same with sofi last december. Same with rklb last year (the ceo sold shares at the top ($7) which caused the stock to go on an endless downward spiral.

I have SO MANY more examples to give. I feel like I represent the erd and the market can see where the herd is leaning (I can't see it) and they have access to info and all the summaries that we dont have, and they can use it to go against us. Once a ton of retail exited sofi, the stock started flying. Sofi was a joke in this forum and everyone loved to clown on them a few months ago.; Well, it did happen in late 2021.; That's your first mistake. No one uses or cares about P/E unless you take a finance class lol.; You got it. Funny coincidence that is; Stock doing just fine, was 80 bucks 2 years ago. Now almost 600; Yep holding everything. I see no reason to sell any of them. I just have no new information to share about them.

I almost sold BTU when it was nearing $30. AMR is mostly sold down already after a massive bull run in 2023 and just holding onto lingering position.; Depends on the duration of the hold, the ATR, the institutional buy-in and how sensitive the underlying stock is to news catalysts.; Gotcha, you ever consider just playing into the market and buying SPY/VOO just an ETF? Also how did you get enough money to retire then? Just by striking gold on options?; Only for PEs to now be 20% higher than the 2021 peak.; Well yeah no one cares NOW because they don't matter it nonsense bubbles. They will matter soon.

In the long run, stocks follow their earnings. If a stock goes up 100% when their earnings go up 20%, there's gonna be a closing of that gap; Yea, but they were at 362 before that fall in 2022.; Still good, tsla was 420; For sure.

Have held Meta since 2016, and bought more in 2018.

I'm doing pretty good on it, cried myself to sleep in 2022 though LOL."

Apple Vision Pro & Trading,"Happy Thanksgiving ladies and gentlemen.

I have had this product on my mind for a while and tried the demo at the store - it was sick. If this will work with Schwab as well as all brokers preferably by app over safari, with Tradingview as well, running a lot at once with real-time data, I feel it could revolutionize my workspace.

I am wondering if any of you have an Apple Vision Pro, use it or tried to use it for trading, what your genuine opinions are on getting one. I am considering waiting for the next gen out of fears it wont be able to keep up with my trading and charting, and don’t know if these fears are unfounded.

Thank you ",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h21rdw/apple_vision_pro_trading/,0,2024-11-28 18:59:06,"

[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse); Most people complain about the weight for extended use. So unless you have a thick strong neck like a wrestler or only intend to use it for short periods, it may not be so good ergonomically.; nah. get two of these instead -

[https://www.msi.com/Content-Creation-Monitor/Prestige-PS341WU](https://www.msi.com/Content-Creation-Monitor/Prestige-PS341WU); Lmao who wants a brick strapped to their head everyday ; It’s too heavy and uncomfortable for long periods. Even with top relief strap. Just add more monitors to your work space. Unless you have Mac and unless they updated support peripheral since launch, it also had no mouse support. You’ll have to trade with pinching and poking a virtual keyboard.; Sucks ass, heavy, uncomfortable, etc. Returned mine a week later."
Apple looking for a run to the upside?,"I love to look at charts and analyse the clear patterns forming (I recently posted about the possible NVDA pullback, falling from the ascending wedge).

Here we have an ascending triangle forming. This is considered bullish, looking to make a move to the upside with my target price being between $260 and $280.

I drew on 2 possible paths I believe the price action could follow.

[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse); “Love to look at charts” ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); stock performance is driven by news and financials, it doesn't care about your chart patterns. it may sometimes match the pattern and sometimes doesn't so what's the point, it's a gamble all the same.; RSI is in the 60’s so according to that metric it still has room to move up; https://preview.redd.it/smi5nopego3e1.jpeg?width=1354&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=44fd517589b27118c04a59fa6ab08c11011224f3

Ohh now do this one! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267); Can anybody tell me what these lines mean?; Do a banbet then; I see 257 by EOY; I should give my magic 8ball a shake to confirm this; Technically, you can make a case for a short or long trade - no one knows until it breaks out or breaks down.; ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271); My point is in the post, if there is a breakout of the ascending triangle, there’s a good chance it creates new highs at my target price. Yes, I understand that news and financials drives prices, but so do MMs following specific trading strategies? I also don’t believe I categorically said it is definitely going this way. Anyway, you do you pal; He thinks by Xmas APL will rise to $247 - $257; From the text: Here we have an ascending triangle forming. You can find more info about patterns in the following article. [https://www.ig.com/uk/trading-strategies/10-chart-patterns-every-trader-needs-to-know-190514](https://www.ig.com/uk/trading-strategies/10-chart-patterns-every-trader-needs-to-know-190514); Forget the 8ball shake yourself, it's alot more satisfying; Not quite what I'm saying, but definitely a possibility! If you look at the image I shared, the pattern suggests that there should be a breakout most likely before the start of Jan."
