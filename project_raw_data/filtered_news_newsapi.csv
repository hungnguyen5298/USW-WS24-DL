iPhone 17 Pro Max vs. iPhone 16 Pro Max: Biggest expected upgrades,"When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.

An iPhone 17 Pro Max vs. iPhone 16 Pro Max comparison lets us consider potential changes to Apple's most premium phone (depending on how you feel about the rumored iPhone 17 Air, of course). Yes, Apple's iPhone 17 lineup won't debut until much later in 2025, but some early rumors coupled with expected changes have given us some idea of what's coming later this year. So there's no time like the present to start thinking about potential improvements.

And Apple will have to do a lot to improve upon the iPhone 16 Pro Max, which is not only the best iPhone to have come out last fall, it's also the best phone overall based on our testing. Besides the strong performance and epic battery life, Apple's current premium model also produces outstanding photos thanks to a stellar camera setup. And like other models in the iPhone 16 lineup, it supports the latest Apple Intelligence features.

We can expect a new chipset powering the iPhone 17 Pro Max, which could bring improvements to both performance and battery life. Rumors are also pointing toward new cameras for the Pro Max model. Meanwhile, Apple could be contemplating a possible redesign that would dramatically change the look of the phone compared to recent iPhones.

Here's a closer look at how the iPhone 17 Pro Max vs. iPhone 16 Pro Max match-up is shaping up at the moment, based on what we've heard so far about Apple's iPhone plans.

The iPhone 16 Pro Max starts at $1,199, making it the most expensive model in Apple's lineup. That price matches the cost of the iPhone 15 Pro Max, which debuted with a $100 price hike from its predecessor.

Ideally, the iPhone 17 Pro Max would cost the same as the iPhone 16 Pro Max, too, but that might not be the case. An early iPhone pricing rumor claims iPhone 17 prices could be on the rise, though the rumor doesn't specify by how much or which models would be affected.

There are two reasons to not fret about a potential hike. For starters, it's still early in the iPhone 17 rumor cycle, and pricing information really doesn't come into focus until just before the phones launch. Secondly, if Apple does release an iPhone 17 Air as has been widely rumored, that phone is currently expected to cost more than the Pro Max. You would think that might put a cap on how much Apple might charge for the iPhone 17 Pro Max.

Availability for Apple's new phones is a little bit more clear. The iPhone 16 Pro Max debuted with the rest of the iPhone 16 lineup back in September, Apple's favorite month for releasing new phones. Barring any major shakeup, you can pencil in a potential iPhone 17 release for September 2025.

While the iPhone 16 Pro Max resembled its predecessor in the broadest sense of the word, it did introduce a fairly significant change -- a larger display. The 6.9-inch screen meant the iPhone 16 Pro Max was taller, wider and heavier than the iPhone 15 Pro Max, which offered a 6.7-inch panel. Otherwise, the iPhone 16 Pro Max was very recognizable as an Apple phone, with a Dynamic Island feature housing the front camera and Face ID sensors up front and a triangular camera array on the back of the device.

The look of the iPhone 17 Pro Max could change things up quite radically, if rumors about Apple's design plans prove accurate. The larger 6.9-inch screen size is expected to return, but the back of the phone could feature a horizontal camera bar that spans across the device, not unlike Google's recent Pixel flagships. That claim is based on a leaked photo that purportedly shows off the iPhone 17 Pro Max's frame.

Speaking of frames, there's some debate as to whether Apple will continue to use titanium for the frames of its Pro phones or switch to aluminum as a cost-saving measure. Given how Apple hyped the switch to titanium a couple years back, we don't buy the idea that the phone maker would change course so quickly, but it's something to keep in mind.

While the iPhone 17 Pro Max's display size is likely to match the iPhone 16 Pro Max's, there could be another display change in the works. One leaker expects Apple to turn to Low-Dielectric TEE technology for this year's Pro model panels -- a move that would make the displays more durable while boosting power efficiency.

Early color rumors for the iPhone 17 Pro suggest that Teal Titanium, Green Titanium and Dark Green Titanium could be on the agenda for this year's phones; since the Pro and Pro Max share colors, we'd assume that rumor applies to the iPhone 17 Pro Max, too. However, Apple tends to feature more muted color options for its Pro phones -- the iPhone 16 Pro Max comes in Black, White, Desert and Natural Titanium -- so we wouldn't put too much weight on that claim just yet.

The iPhone 16 Pro Max saw a couple of major improvements to its camera setup, gaining a new 48MP Fusion camera as well as a 48MP ultrawide lens. The Fusion camera worked faster than its predecessor, resulting in faster focus and no shutter lag. The ultrawide camera introduced higher resolution than the 12MP sensor Apple previously used.

Expect those features to return to the iPhone 17 Pro Max, with another possible change coming to third rear camera on the upcoming phone. Rumors claim Apple will introduce a 48MP telephoto camera, an upgrade from 12MP sensor that the iPhone 16 Pro Max uses for its zoom lens. There's no word on whether that camera would increase the zoom length from the 5x optical zoom that the current iPhone offers.

There's also talk of at least one of Apple's Pro models adding a variable aperture that photographers can control with a mechanical system. This addition would give you greater control over the depth of field in your photos.

One other camera rumor would affect all iPhone 17 models, as the TrueDepth camera up front could get an update this fall. One analyst suggests the new phones will feature a 24MP camera compared to the 12MP shooter used by current iPhones.

Since new iPhones tend to receive upgraded silicon, we're expecting the iPhone 17 lineup to feature new A19 chipsets. In the case of the iPhone 17 Pro Max, that probably means an A19 Pro system-on-chip.

It's impossible at this stage to say what kind of performance improvements an A19 chipset might deliver compared to the A18 Pro powering the iPhone 16 Pro Max. Initial reports suggested the A19 might be built on a 2-nanometer process, meaning its transistors would be packed closer together than the 3nm A18 system-on-chip. That usually translates to better performance and less power consumption. However, subsequent reports have indicated that the A19 will also be a 3nm system-on-chip.

The iPhone 17 Pro Max could benefit from one rumored change compared to the iPhone 16 Pro Max. Apple is expected to increase the RAM in its new phones with an eye toward helping improve artificial intelligence performance. That would mean 12GB of memory in the iPhone 17 Pro Max compared to 8GB in the current model.

Here's where the iPhone 17 Pro Max might have a hard time improving on the standard set by the iPhone 16 Pro Max, as the current model posted the best time of any iPhone we've ever put through our custom battery test. In that test, we have phones surf the web continuously over cellular until they run out of power. The average phone can hold out for a little more than 10 hours on that test, but the iPhone 16 Pro Max averaged 17 hours and 35 minutes.

The A18 Pro chipset helped the iPhone 16 Pro Max land on the best phone battery life list, but the current model also benefitted from a larger battery than its predecessor. There aren't any rumors yet about what kind of battery the iPhone 17 Pro Max will use, outside of a report that Apple could try a new glue to hold batteries in place, making them easier to replace in the new models.

One change we hope to see with the iPhone 17 Pro Max is an improvement to charging speeds. The iPhone 16 Pro Max continues to support 30W wired charging, while other phones have adopted much faster speeds.

By the time the iPhone 17 Pro Max debuts, Apple will have introduced iOS 19. Of course, that same software update will be available to the iPhone 16 Pro Max, so there's likely to be little difference in the features both phones support. The same thing goes for Apple Intelligence -- Apple could introduce some iPhone 17-specific AI features just like Visual Intelligence only works on iPhone 16 models. But for the most part, the same AI features supported on the iPhone 17 Pro Max will be able to run on the iPhone 16 Pro Max.

Assuming a September 2025 launch for the iPhone 17 Pro Max, we've got a lot of time for more rumors to emerge. That should provide a clearer picture on what kind of changes to expect from an iPhone 17 Pro Max vs. iPhone 16 Pro Max comparison.",Yahoo,https://www.yahoo.com/tech/iphone-17-pro-max-vs-120010132.html,2025-01-02,
The M4 MacBook Air May Be Apple's First New Product of 2025,"If even half the reports we've heard over the past few months turn out to be accurate, 2025 will be a busy year for Apple. While we'll likely have to wait a few more months for bigger reveals like the new iPhone SE and iPhone 17 Air, one of its more routine product updates could be right around the corner.

Since making the move into Apple silicon in late 2020, Apple's MacBooks have gradually settled into a comfortable cycle of annual updates, and it looks like Apple may have set the stage for a spring/fall cycle of MacBook Air and MacBook Pro launches.

The M1 and M2 chip releases were a bit scattershot as Apple redesigned and realigned its MacBook family throughout that process. The base M1 chip launched in 2020 in a MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro that were virtually identical to their Intel predecessors in every other way.

However, by late 2021, Apple was changing things up with new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models that sported more powerful M1 Pro/Max chips. In mid-2022, it gave the same treatment to the MacBook Air, eliminating the iconic wedge-shaped design for something that looked more like a ""MacBook"" of old (sans suffix), unifying the entire family's aesthetic.

The odd little 13-inch MacBook Pro was refreshed with the M2 chip, but it became the only MacBook to retain the old design. In late 2023, Apple finally phased that out with its M3 MacBook Pro release in favor of a more affordable 14-inch MacBook Pro -- the first in that design to feature a base M-series chip.

The M3 MacBook Air lineup came five months later, in March 2024. This gave us the most consistent MacBook lineup we'd seen in years, at least until Apple unveiled the M4 MacBooks Pro in October. Even then, it took the opportunity to bump the base memory configuration of every MacBook Air up to 16 GB -- even the 2022 M2 MacBook Air, which it still sells at an affordable entry-level price.

That was an interim step at best, as every reliable source suggested an M4 MacBook Air lineup would be unveiled in early 2025. It didn't take too large of a crystal ball for anyone to make that prediction, considering the last two generations had similar launch timing. Still, if we had any doubts at all, Apple tipped its hand in macOS Sequoia 15.2 with the code containing references to a ""MacBook Air (13-inch, M4, 2025)"" and ""MacBook Air (15-inch, M4, 2025).""

Just before Christmas, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman added that the M4 MacBook Air will be ""earlier"" than the rest of Apple's spring products.

While the code references could mean they'll arrive while macOS 15.2 is still current, that's by no means guaranteed. ""Earlier"" could mean anything from January to March. Last year, Apple quietly pushed the M3 MacBook Air out via press release in early March, ahead of the press event that many anticipated would come in late March or early April to herald the arrival of new iPads (which actually came in May).

Apple also had its hands full with the Vision Pro at the time, which was the first product launch in 2024, landing in stores on February 2. While that was far from a mainstream product in terms of sales, it required significant retooling of Apple's stores and training of staff to create effective demonstrations of its groundbreaking spatial computing technology. Plus, Apple's marketing folks were probably reluctant to have other big product releases distracting from the Vision Pro.

We haven't heard much about Apple's next MacBook Air beyond its anticipated release date, which suggests we shouldn't expect too many groundbreaking changes.

After all, Apple gave the MacBook Air its first-ever redesign in 2022 and added a 15-inch model in 2023. It's likely going to stick with that design for a while.

However, as we've seen from the M4 MacBook Pro and Mac mini, an upgrade to an M4 chip will add more capabilities beyond just raw horsepower. For example, the M4 chip supports Thunderbolt 4 ports and can drive up to two external displays. It's also pretty much guaranteed that the base $999 model will now feature 16 GB RAM and should be upgradeable to 32 GB -- a nice boost over the M3, which caps out at 24 GB.

Those are all standard features of the M4 chip, as is improved power efficiency, which should translate to longer battery life.

While the ports will almost certainly be Thunderbolt 4, it's unclear how many we'll get. The base M4 MacBook Pro was boosted to three this year, but Apple might choose to stick with two on the MacBook Air.

Similarly, the M4 MacBook Pro models gained a 12-megapixel Center Stage camera with support for Desk View. The camera systems were previously identical across the entire M3 MacBook family, so this improvement could find its way into the M4 MacBook Air to keep things consistent.

Lastly, Apple's addition of nano-texture glass as an option for the M4 MacBook Pro and iMac suggests that it might do the same for the M4 MacBook Air. Nano-texture glass, which reduces glare without sacrificing clarity and color, debuted on Apple's $5,000 Pro Display XDR in 2019 and final 27-inch (Intel) iMac in 2020. It came to Apple's pricey Studio Display for Macs in 2022, but this year Apple has been rolling it out more widely, with the iPad Pro, M4 MacBook Pro, and 24-inch iMac. It still feels like more of a ""Pro"" feature, but its availability on the iMac gives us some hope that Apple might do the same for the MacBook Air.

MacBook Pro M4 Pro Review: Super-powered and Super-pricey,"Add the word ""super"" in front of any positive adjectives, and you've got something to describe the new 2024 MacBook Pro with the M4 Pro chip. That's, in short, the entire review of this laptop. If you want a device that's portable, powerful, efficient, beautiful, sturdy, and everything else that a laptop can, and maybe should be, the MacBook Pro with the M4 Pro chip has got you covered.

I have been using this laptop as my daily driver for over a month, and here's my review of the M4 Pro MacBook Pro.

Full disclosure, Apple sent us a very souped-up version of the MacBook Pro for the review. Here are the complete specs:

Yes, yes, it's an expensive proposition, and one that most people don't need. But if you do need one, or as is more likely want one, here's what you can expect.

First off, the 2024 MacBook Pro doesn't change anything in terms of the design. The 16-inch unit I have been using has literally the same dimensions as the 16-inch M2 Pro MacBook Pro. And, for some reason, it's 10 grams lighter as per Apple's documentation, coming in at 2.14kg instead of 2.15kg. I'm unsure where this weight reduction comes from, but I can tell you with certainty, that you won't feel it. If you've used a 16-inch M2 Pro MacBook Pro and you thought that was heavy, you'll find this every bit as heavy as that one.

If, like me, you were using a MacBook Air, the new MacBook Pro will feel insanely hefty.

All that is not to say that this is a bad laptop, or a heavy one. It is heavy and bulky, but it's just a gorgeous device to look at. Especially in the Space Black color that I have here.

It's also very well built. As has been the case with MacBooks since at least 2013, when I first got one, you can open the lid with one hand, and it opens up oh-so-smoothly. The rubber feet on the bottom offer just enough grip to ensure it didn't slip away while I was busy typing away this review, alongside all the other articles I have been writing this last month. And every angle you set the display at, just feels like it was supposed to be the angle for it, because the hinge never seems to struggle to keep the rather massive screen in place.

I also really appreciate Apple making the MacBook Pros thicker from the absolutely unnecessary slim things they were back in 2017 (when I, rather stupidly, bought one by the way). Not only does this make the MacBook Pro look and feel more well-built, it also allows for some of the most useful ports to be brought back to the laptop. So you do get three Thunderbolt 5 Type-C ports (two on the left, one on the right), and you also get the headphone jack, an SD card slot, and an HDMI-out port -- all without having to use any dongles. Plus, you get MagSafe.

These ports are nothing new. In fact, the M2 Pro MacBook Pro also had all of the same ports (except it had Thunderbolt 4 instead of Thunderbolt 5), on exactly the same places. But, coming from a 2017 MacBook Pro, and then an M1 MacBook Air, these ports have really made my life a lot easier, and the dongle I purchased for my 2017 MacBook Pro now lies unused and gathering dust in a long-forgotten drawer.

Needless to say, I am glad to have a laptop with a decent number of ports on it.

I should also address the notch here, because apart from that, the bezels around the display are quite slim, and the notch is the only eyesore on this laptop. Not for nothing though, has Apple trained us to forget and entirely ignore the notch since the days of the iPhone X, and I found myself very quickly forgetting that there's a giant piece of bezel staring at my face when I'm engrossed in watching a Netflix show on this machine.

What's more, on the MacBook Pro, the notch can be made useful, thanks to a bunch of third party developers who made the Notch Nook app. So, I now have the otherwise useless eyesore of a notch showing me my currently playing media, a quick calendar with the meetings and events for the day, and a bunch of other features that I haven't enabled, but can be added to the notch nook as well.

Speaking of the notch, let's also talk about the display. Obviously, in my practiced ignorance of the eyesore that the notch is, I was constantly focused on the display right in front of me. It's a beautiful, 16.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR display with 254ppi and ProMotion support. It's also configurable with a Nano-texture display, for a matte appearance, less reflections, and, in my opinion, an easier time staring at the screen for long hours without tiring out your eyes.

The device Apple sent us is configured with the nano-texture display, and I can tell you without a doubt that I have spent more time staring at this screen in one sitting than I ever have on any other MacBook, and this display just doesn't seem to cause as much fatigue to my eyes. That's great.

Plus, the reduced reflections are no joke. They are massively reduced. The window blinds right behind my workspace are absolutely invisible on this screen, and they are absolutely clearly visible on a MacBook Pro without a nano-texture display.

The display itself is really good too. Not that I was expecting anything less from a MacBook Pro display. I did have my doubts about the matte screen maybe ruining the experience of watching multimedia content, but it doesn't. It does seem a smidge less bright as compared to the glossy displays of other MacBook Pros, but it's plenty bright, and it's definitely not going to make you wish for a brighter display if you're using it out in the sun, or even against harsh lighting. It's just a good quality display with the Nano Texture done just right.

Super-powerful seems like too much of a superlative for most devices I have used and reviewed, but in the case of this M4 Pro powered MacBook Pro, it might just be an apt description. Should I use ""Extremely powerful"" instead? Wait. I asked Writing Tools to figure out a professional way of saying ""extremely powerful"", and here it is: Possessing exceptionally potent capabilities. Yes, that.

Anyway, the M4 Pro in itself is an ""exceptionally potent"" processor, but paired with 48GB of RAM, it takes things to the next level. Especially if you're trying out things like LMStudio on your MacBook.

That's not all I did, by the way. I used this MacBook Pro to do everything I normally do -- which includes writing (in a markdown app like Paper), editing photos and screenshots in Photoshop, having more than 30 tabs opened simultaneously (usually for no other reason than not being able to figure out which ones I should close), and I've also started using Freeform for project planning, so that's usually hovering around as well.

For a workload like this, the MacBook Pro is overkill, and easily so. There's absolutely no universe where I need this much power for the tasks I do in a regular day of work. At most, I would add Apple Music running in the background for music, but that's about it.

However, I did try to push it as well. I installed Mythic on it to play some AAA Windows games, and they all work spectacularly well. Especially Hitman 3, which is once again my favourite way to spend time at my work desk.

I also tried editing videos here, and sure, they may not be the kind of exceptional quality you'd find on the Beebom Instagram or YouTube channels, but the point is Final Cut Pro never lagged, stuttered, or even took longer than a breath to background render and playback everything smoothly. I'm talking 4K clips here, and multiple compound clips loaded up on top of each other, and this MacBook Pro barely breaks a sweat.

Lastly, just to round things off, I did run some benchmarks, and if benchmark numbers are your jam, feast your eyes on the screenshots below.

The keyboard too, remains the same as the older M2 Pro MacBook Pro, which means it is just as good as that one was. Now, I know that technically, this is the same keyboard as the one on my M1 MacBook Air from 2020, but on the Pro, it just feels better. I can't say why that is, and it could just be my mind playing tricks, but I don't think so.

Judging by all the Reddit posts and forum discussions about this exact topic, most people agree that the same Magic Keyboard on the MacBook Pro just feels better, more substantial, with a more pronounced thunk when pressing the keys.

All this could be because of the thicker chassis that the MacBook Pro bears, and it most likely is, the point being that the MacBook Pro M4 Pro keyboard is just a wonderful keyboard to type on. The keys feel comfortable, and the typing experience is pretty much the best I have experienced on a laptop so far.

I am incredibly thankful that Apple switched away from the Butterfly keys on the MacBooks from back in the day, because these new keyboards on the M-series MacBooks (Airs and Pros) are definitely better, more reliable, and more fun to type on.

If you often find yourself spending long hours typing on your laptop (also known as -- me), the keyboard on this MacBook Pro is brilliant. It won't tire you out, and it feels amazing.

One more thing I want to address, because a few of my colleagues seemed to have an issue with it, is the size of this keyboard. A lot of people, especially those coming from a MacBook Air, or an older (read 2017) MacBook Pro, seem to think that this keyboard is more compact than the ones on their laptops. That, is absolutely not the case. I sat down with a measuring tape and measured the length and width of the keyboard on this M4 Pro MacBook Pro and the M1 MacBook Air I was using before this, and they are the exact same size. If anything, the MacBook Pro keyboard is slightly taller, because the function keys are full-sized.

The only reason this keyboard looks more compact, is because of the huge speakers on each side.

The huge speakers on each side that I referred to, are actually one of the best things about this laptop. I don't know quite how to put it into words that justify them, but they are excellent. In every sense of the word, these speakers are by far the best laptop speakers I have tested.

They are loud. Too loud, in fact, in most scenarios, and they have excellent sound quality. Whether you're watching a movie, or even listening to music straight on your laptop speakers -- something which, by the way, I would have attributed to a poor taste in audio quality back in the day -- these speakers just don't disappoint.

There's excellent clarity at all volume levels, absolutely no distortion at max volume, and there's bass. Thanks to the size of this chassis, the speakers have enough air to move and produce a good amount of bass. It's obviously not what you'd get with high quality external speakers (nothing is), but it's much, much better than pretty much any laptop speakers I have heard. And, being at the Beebom office, we do get a lot of laptops in for review, so the sample size I'm talking about is quite large.

So if you find yourself watching movies on your laptop a lot, this MacBook Pro wouldn't disappoint.

Speaking of watching movies, not only will you enjoy the multimedia experience on this laptop, it's also gonna let you binge watch content without dying on a whim. Let me put it this way, Apple claims the battery can last for 24 hours of video streaming, and in my experience that seems a modest claim. This laptop simply doesn't want to die.

I'm not one for good charging habits, as some of my colleagues at Beebom are, which means I often forget to charge my devices, and sometimes forget to bring chargers along entirely.

With this M4 Pro MacBook Pro, I no longer forget to bring the charger with me, because I deliberately leave it at home now. Simply because the battery life is absolutely stellar. Once charged to a 100%, the MacBook Pro takes me through a day of heavy workload without dropping below 40-50%. Which is crazy. It means I can use this without charging for 2 days straight (and I have, once or twice), and I don't have to worry about having it die out on me while I'm busy working.

Suffice it to say, that unless you're editing 4K and 8K videos all day long, this laptop will not make you reach for the charger in a day of heavy usage.

All that good stuff about this laptop? The power of the M4 Pro, the beautiful ProMotion display, and everything else, comes at a steep price as well. As specced, the M4 Pro MacBook Pro costs $3,649, which is a staggering amount of money. You can get the M4 Pro in a 14-inch variant starting at $1,999 and in a 16-inch variant starting at $2,499. However, those will not include the Nano Texture Display, the 48GB of RAM (however, 24GB is the base RAM configuration for the M4 Pro MacBook Pro, which is great), or the 2TB of storage (although 512GB is standard for M4 Pro now, which also, is good enough, if not plenty).

The new 2024 MacBook Pro is a confusing laptop to talk about. It's simultaneously the perfect laptop, while also being difficult-to-recommend. At a starting price of $2,000, it's not a cheap idea and it will definitely put a strain on most wallets. However, it also brings the best of Apple's laptop-making prowess to your desks.

For most people, the MacBook Pro is not a necessity -- it's hard to need a MacBook Pro -- and the MacBook Air would do just fine. With the M3 chip, the MacBook Air starts at $1,099, albeit with 16GB of base RAM. However, you can spec-up the MacBook Air M3 to 24GB of RAM and it would still cost you $1,499.

The only question is, do you need a new Mac right now? If you don't, I would suggest waiting it out for a while because the new M4 MacBook Air should be coming in the first quarter of this year, which would make your M3 Air look rather a silly purchase right now.

As for the MacBook Pro with the M4 Pro chip, if you've got nearly $2000 burning a hole in your pocket, this laptop is a good way to spend that money. It won't disappoint, obviously, but more importantly, it will make you want to use your Mac a lot more.

This is a laptop for creators, for people who find the M2 and M3 chipsets ""not quite powerful enough"" for their use-case, and for the ones who want to shave off another 10 seconds from the time that it takes their M2 Pro MacBook Pros to export their FCP projects. If that sounds like you, go ahead and buy this MacBook Pro.

For everyone else, either wait for the M4 MacBook Air, or get the M2 or M3 MacBook Air right now.",Beebom,https://beebom.com/macbook-pro-m4-pro-review/,2025-01-02,
"Refresh Rate 120Hz di iPhone 17, Kelewat Jadul? - News Directory 3","Could the iPhone 17 be the first standard iPhone to boast a buttery-smooth 120Hz refresh rate?

Rumors are swirling that Apple is finally bringing its ProMotion display technology to the standard iPhone lineup with the upcoming iPhone 17.Leaker Digital chat Station, known for their accurate Apple insights, suggests that all iPhone 17 models, not just the Pro versions, will feature the high refresh rate display.

This move would mark a significant shift for Apple, which has traditionally reserved the 120Hz promotion display for its premium iPhone Pro models. The technology delivers a noticeably smoother scrolling experience, more responsive gaming, and crisper animations.

Bringing 120Hz to the standard iPhone 17 could be a game-changer for consumers. It would offer a more premium experience at a possibly more accessible price point.

However, the question remains: will this upgrade come at a cost? Some analysts speculate that the inclusion of a 120Hz display could led to a price increase for the standard iPhone 17.

Meanwhile, rumors also suggest that Apple might be pushing the boundaries even further with the iPhone 17 Pro models. Some reports indicate that the Pro versions could feature an even higher 144Hz refresh rate, offering an even smoother and more responsive experience.

Apple has remained tight-lipped about its plans for the iPhone 17, fueling speculation and anticipation. Could the tech giant be planning a surprise launch to unveil these exciting new features? Only time will tell.

Is the Shift Toward a More Premium Experience for All?

The potential inclusion of a 120Hz display across the entire iPhone 17 lineup signals a possible shift in Apple's strategy.By bringing premium features to its standard models, Apple could be aiming to attract a wider range of consumers and further solidify its position as a leader in the smartphone market.

Impact on the Smartphone Market

If Apple does indeed deliver a 120Hz display on all iPhone 17 models, it could put pressure on competitors to follow suit. This could lead to a wave of innovation and improvements across the entire smartphone industry, ultimately benefiting consumers.

Could Apple be bringing its coveted ProMotion display technology to all iPhone 17 models? Whispers from leaker Digital Chat Station on Weibo have ignited excitement among tech enthusiasts, hinting at a potential game-changer for Apple's upcoming smartphone lineup.

For years, ProMotion, which allows for refresh rates up to 120Hz, has been a premium feature reserved for Apple's Pro models. This technology delivers a noticeably smoother and more responsive experience, particularly for scrolling, gaming, and watching videos. While Apple has maintained that the standard 60Hz refresh rate on its non-Pro iPhones is sufficient, the gap between its offerings and competitors has widened. Brands like Samsung, Google, and even iQOO have been pushing the boundaries with refresh rates reaching up to 144Hz.

A shift in Strategy?

The potential inclusion of a 120Hz display on the standard iPhone 17 could signal a significant shift in Apple's strategy. It might very well be a move to bridge the gap between its standard and Pro models, offering a more compelling experience for budget-conscious consumers who still desire a premium display.

However, some might argue that this move is long overdue. Apple's decision to reserve ProMotion for its higher-priced models has been a point of contention for some users who felt it was an artificial way to differentiate its product line.

Impact on the Smartphone Market

If the rumors prove true, the iPhone 17 standard could shake up the smartphone market.A 120Hz display at a potentially more accessible price point could entice users who were previously hesitant to splurge on a Pro model. It could also put pressure on competitors to further innovate and offer even more compelling features at competitive prices.

The inclusion of the 120Hz refresh rate is expected to be paired with LTPO (Low-temperature Polycrystalline Oxide) technology. This allows the display to dynamically adjust its refresh rate, scaling down to as low as 1Hz when the screen is idle. This dynamic adjustment not only delivers a smoother visual experience but also significantly improves battery life.

One of the key benefits of LTPO is the ability to power the Always-On display feature. This feature, previously exclusive to Pro models, allows users to view essential details like time, date, and notifications even when the screen is locked.With LTPO, the iPhone 17 can maintain this functionality without draining the battery.By extending the 120Hz refresh rate and Always-on display to all iPhone 17 models, Apple is poised to deliver a more consistent and premium experience across its entire lineup. Only time will tell if these rumors become reality, but one thing is certain: anticipation is building, and the tech world is eagerly awaiting Apple's next move.

Apple is rumored to be making a major change to its iPhone 17 lineup,bringing a coveted feature to all models: a 120Hz refresh rate. This move could level the playing field for consumers,offering a smoother,more responsive experience across the entire iPhone 17 range.

For years,Apple has reserved the buttery-smooth 120Hz refresh rate for its premium Pro models,while standard iPhones stuck with a 60Hz display. This decision ofen left budget-conscious consumers feeling like they were missing out on a key feature found in competing Android devices.

""Apple has always focused on delivering a polished and optimized user experience,"" said one tech analyst. ""While they may not always be the first to adopt new features, they often refine them and integrate them seamlessly into their ecosystem.""

The inclusion of a 120Hz refresh rate across the iPhone 17 lineup is a significant shift in strategy, potentially signaling Apple's desire to offer a more consistent premium experience across its entire product range.

The big question on everyone's mind is: will this upgrade come at a cost? Rumors suggest that Apple may increase the price of the standard iPhone 17 to accommodate the new display technology.

Historically,Apple has maintained a clear price distinction between its standard and Pro iPhones. The Pro models boast premium features like superior cameras and enhanced performance, justifying their higher price tag.

However, the inclusion of a 120Hz refresh rate on the standard iPhone 17 could disrupt this pricing strategy. Apple might choose to absorb the added cost through production efficiencies or by trimming costs in other areas. This approach would allow them to maintain the iPhone 17 standard's competitive price point while still delivering enhanced value to consumers.

Ultimately, Apple's final pricing decision will depend on its overall market positioning for the iPhone 17 and its desire to remain competitive in the fiercely contested smartphone arena.

While a 120Hz refresh rate is a welcome upgrade for most users, rumors suggest that Apple may be taking things a step further with the iPhone 17 Pro.

Whispers from the tech world indicate that Apple is considering a significant upgrade to the iPhone 17 Pro's display, potentially pushing the refresh rate to a blistering 144Hz. This would put the iPhone 17 Pro on par with some of the most advanced gaming smartphones on the market, offering an ultra-smooth and responsive experience for demanding users.

If true, this move would solidify Apple's position as a leader in mobile display technology, further differentiating the pro models from their standard counterparts.

Could the iPhone 17 Pro deliver an even smoother visual experience with a groundbreaking 144Hz refresh rate?

Whispers are circulating that Apple is considering a significant leap in display technology for its upcoming flagship phone. Rumors suggest the iPhone 17 Pro could feature a buttery-smooth 144Hz refresh rate, a significant upgrade from the current 120Hz ProMotion technology found in the iPhone 14 Pro models.

This potential move would solidify Apple's commitment to delivering top-tier visual performance, offering even more fluid scrolling, animations, and gaming experiences. Gamers and content creators, who demand the highest level of visual fidelity and responsiveness, would likely be particularly excited by this development.

However, such a leap in refresh rate comes with challenges. higher refresh rates typically consume more power,potentially impacting battery life. Apple would need to find innovative solutions to manage power consumption without sacrificing the iPhone's renowned battery performance.

This potential shift in strategy reflects a broader trend in the smartphone market. as competitors aggressively push the boundaries of display technology, Apple appears to be adapting its approach.The inclusion of ProMotion and Always-On display features in the standard iPhone 17 model already signals a willingness to embrace new technologies more readily.The rumored 144Hz refresh rate for the iPhone 17 Pro could be a sign that Apple is becoming more willing to take risks and cater to the evolving demands of consumers.It could also be a strategic move to bridge the gap between the standard and Pro models, offering a more consistent and accessible premium experience.

Only time will tell if these rumors materialize. but one thing is clear: Apple is facing increasing pressure to innovate and keep pace with the rapidly evolving smartphone landscape.

could this be the end of the ProMotion divide?

Apple is reportedly planning to equip all iPhone 17 models with its coveted 120Hz ProMotion display technology,a move that could significantly enhance the user experience for a wider range of consumers.

This potential shift marks a departure from Apple's previous strategy of reserving the smoother, more responsive display technology for its higher-priced Pro models. The move could be a strategic play to bolster the iPhone's competitiveness in the increasingly crowded flagship smartphone market.

The inclusion of the 120Hz refresh rate is expected to be paired with LTPO (Low-temperature Polycrystalline Oxide) technology. This allows the display to dynamically adjust its refresh rate, scaling down to as low as 1Hz when the screen is idle. This dynamic adjustment not only delivers a smoother visual experience but also considerably improves battery life.

While Apple has maintained that the standard 60Hz refresh rate on its non-Pro iPhones is sufficient, the gap between its offerings and competitors has widened. Brands like Samsung, Google, and even iQOO have been pushing the boundaries with refresh rates reaching up to 144Hz.

The potential inclusion of a 120Hz display on the iPhone 17 standard could signal a notable shift in Apple's strategy. It could be a move to bridge the gap between its standard and Pro models, offering a more compelling experience for budget-conscious consumers who still desire a premium display.

However, some might argue that this move is long overdue. Apple's decision to reserve ProMotion for its higher-priced models has been a point of contention for some users who felt it was an artificial way to differentiate its product line.

If the rumors prove true, the iPhone 17 standard could shake up the smartphone market. A 120Hz display at a possibly more accessible price point could entice users who were previously hesitant to splurge on a Pro model. It could also put pressure on competitors to further innovate and offer even more compelling features at competitive prices.

Only time will tell if Apple will indeed bring ProMotion to the masses with the iPhone 17. But one thing is certain: the anticipation is building, and the tech world is eagerly awaiting Apple's next move.

apple is set to shake up the smartphone market with its upcoming iPhone 17 lineup, bringing a highly anticipated feature to all models: a buttery-smooth 120Hz refresh rate. This move, long requested by users, finally puts apple on par with competitors like Samsung and Google, who have offered high refresh rates on their devices for several years.

The 120Hz refresh rate promises a noticeably smoother and more responsive user experience. Scrolling through social media, playing games, and navigating the interface will feel incredibly fluid. While some may see this as a long-overdue addition, Apple's approach has always been to prioritize quality and integration over being the first to market with new technology.

""Apple has always focused on delivering a polished and optimized user experience,"" said one tech analyst. ""While they may not always be the first to adopt new features, they often refine them and integrate them seamlessly into their ecosystem.""

This move is highly likely to be a welcome addition for many users, enhancing the overall fluidity and responsiveness of the iPhone 17 lineup.

The inclusion of a 120Hz refresh rate across all iPhone 17 models has sparked speculation about a potential price increase for the standard model. This feature has previously been exclusive to the pricier Pro models.

Apple has traditionally maintained a clear price distinction between its standard and Pro models.Though,the decision to bring a premium feature like the 120Hz refresh rate to the entire lineup could signal a shift in strategy.

Only time will tell if Apple will adjust the pricing of the iPhone 17 standard to reflect this upgrade. Consumers will be eagerly awaiting the official declaration to see how this change impacts their wallets.

Apple enthusiasts are buzzing with anticipation for the upcoming iPhone 17 release, but a key question remains: will the price tag reflect the rumored upgrades?

Whispers suggest that Apple may introduce a 120Hz refresh rate display on the standard iPhone 17, a feature previously reserved for the pricier Pro models. This upgrade would deliver smoother scrolling, more responsive gaming, and a generally more fluid user experience.However, such advanced display technology comes at a cost.

While a price increase is certainly possible, Apple might choose to keep the iPhone 17 competitively priced to maintain its market share. The tech giant could potentially offset the added cost of the new display technology through production efficiencies or by making strategic adjustments to other hardware components.

This approach would allow Apple to deliver enhanced value to consumers without significantly impacting the price point. Ultimately,the final decision will depend on Apple's overall market strategy for the iPhone 17 and its desire to remain a dominant force in the ever-competitive smartphone arena.

Why You Should Buy an iPhone 15 in 2025,"These Self Care Apps for iPhone Changed My Habits for the Better Quick LinksThe iPhone 15 Doesn't Look Outdated The iPhone 15 Shares a Screen With the iPhone 16 The A17 Bionic Chip Is Still Highly Capable 48MP Primary Camera Shoot Great Pictures The iPhone 15 Lasts an Entire Day with Moderate Usage Price and Availability Should You Upgrade to iPhone 15? What About a New or Refurbished iPhone 15 Pro? Summary iPhone 15 offers modern features like a great camera, the same display as the iPhone 16, and long battery life for a reasonable price in 2025. The A17 Bionic chip on the iPhone 15 provides exceptional performance for everyday tasks. It also supports iOS 18. The only downside to buying the iPhone 15 is missing on Apple Intelligence. If you're fine with it, you can go with the iPhone 15 without having any second thoughts.

If you want to purchase a new iPhone but don't want to spend more on the latest models, the iPhone 15 could be a great option for you. Here's how the phone stands its ground in 2025.

✕ Remove Ads The iPhone 15 Doesn't Look Outdated

Apple hasn't changed the dimensions or materials of its regular iPhones in a while. Between the iPhone 16 and the iPhone 15, the rear camera module helps differentiate between the phones. Had it not been for the vertically-aligned camera sensors on the newer iPhone, we wouldn't be discussing this aspect at all.

Going with the iPhone 15, you'll still get five subtle yet beautiful color options to choose from, including black, glue, green, yellow, and pink.

The iPhone 15 Shares a Screen With the iPhone 16 ✕ Remove Ads

Even in 2025, the iPhone 15 has a lot going for it. For instance, 2023's flagship has the same display as its successor, the iPhone 16. Both phones share the Super Retina XDR OLED panel with a pixel resolution of 460 ppi and a disappointing refresh rate of 60Hz. Even the peak brightness (1,600 nits for HDR and 2,000 for outdoor usage) is the same across both phones.

You also get the Dynamic Island (released initially with the iPhone 14 Pro) on both iPhones. The only thing the iPhone 16 offers, in addition, is its ability to dim the screen to one nit of brightness, which helps use the phone in poorly lit environments, but you can imitate similar results on the iPhone 15 by reducing its white points (it's an Accessibility setting).

Other than that, there's nothing about the iPhone 15's screen that makes it feel outdated or old.

The A17 Bionic Chip Is Still Highly Capable ✕ Remove Ads

While the iPhone 15 stands right next to the latest iPhone in terms of display, it runs behind in a key aspect: the system-on-a-chip (SoC). 2023's model features the A16 Bionic chipset, which offers enough computational power to edit 4K videos or run video games at the highest graphical settings.

Even though the processor came out in 2022, its GeekBench scores are comparable to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, which debuted in 2023 on Android handsets. Despite all of that, Apple has decided not to release the GenAI features (marketed as Apple Intelligence) on the iPhone 15, and even I agree that this could be a potential downside for those who wish to try the new features.

But if you can look past that, the iPhone 15's CPU and GPU performance won't disappoint at all. You don't get the Apple Intelligence features, but you can still use the new iOS 18 features, which include a revamped Control Center, customizable home/lock screen, RCS support for Messages, the ability to hide apps without downloading a third-party app, and so on.

✕ Remove Ads

Further, Apple should push at least three to four major iOS updates for the device, given the company's excellent track record. With iOS 18, Apple retired the iPhone X and iPhone 8, which came out in 2017. In other words, the phones received the latest iOS updates for a good six years.

48MP Primary Camera Shoot Great Pictures

The iPhone 15 features a 48MP (f/1.6) primary camera (similar to the iPhone 16), and even though the camera resolution is set to 24MP by default, you can use the JPEG MAX button in the Camera app to utilize all the additional pixels. The pictures are super sharp, with balanced colors and excellent dynamic range.

The phone also features a 12MP (f/2.4) ultrawide camera, which captures great photos. In regard to video recording, the iPhone 15 can record 4K Dolby Vision videos at up to 60 fps both from the rear and the 12MP (f/1.9) front camera. Moreover, the iPhone 15's camera system is similar to that of the iPhone 16.

✕ Remove Ads

It's just the Camera Control button on the side and the ultrawide camera's macro shooting ability that tilt the scales slightly in favor of the iPhone 16. But to be very honest, I hardly ever use these features on my iPhone 16, so I can easily recommend the iPhone 15 in 2025.

The iPhone 15 Lasts an Entire Day with Moderate Usage

According to Apple, the iPhone 15 can provide up to 20 hours of offline video playback (offline) and up to 80 hours of audio playback on a single charge. Further, the phone charges up to 50% in 30 minutes with a 20W adapter. You also get support for MagSafe and Qi2 wireless charging (15W).

These numbers, right here, are similar to those on the new iPhone 16. If you can compromise on the 25W MagSafe charging on the latest version, you can save some money and settle with the iPhone 15.

✕ Remove Ads

In our review of the iPhone 15, How-To Geek's Corbin Davenport mentions getting five hours and 20 minutes of screen-on time while still having around 30-35% charge left before plugging the phone back in.

Price and Availability

The baseline iPhone 15 (128GB) is available on Apple's website for $699. If you want more storage, you can get the 256GB variant for $799.

However, you can get the base variant on Best Buy for as low as $579.99 (with immediate activation). The iPhone 15 (256GB) is available on the e-commerce platform for $679.99.

Should You Upgrade to iPhone 15?

I'd recommend the iPhone 15 to anyone who is using an iPhone 11 or iPhone 12 in 2025 and wants to upgrade to a modern yet affordable iPhone variant.

✕ Remove Ads

Of course, if you want to get your hands on the new Apple Intelligence features, you'll have to go with the iPhone 16. But if that's not the case, I don't see why the iPhone 15 shouldn't be on anyone's smartphone shopping list in 2025.

If you've been an Android user for the longest time and wish to get your first iPhone, the iPhone 15 could be a great entry point into the Apple ecosystem. Anyone using a two or three-year-old Android flagship should consider the iPhone 15 a viable option.

What About a New or Refurbished iPhone 15 Pro?

The iPhone 15 Pro offers quite a few advantages over the vanilla version. First, the phone features a titanium frame, giving it a more premium feel. Second, it comes with a ProMotion display (variable refresh rate) and supports the always-on functionality.

✕ Remove Ads

Under the hood, the iPhone 15 Pro runs on the A17 Pro chip, which offers enough computational power to run the Apple Foundation Models, which form the basis of the on-device GenAI features. Hence, if Apple Intelligence is a priority for you, you can look at a new or refurbished iPhone 15 Pro model.

The iPhone 15 Pro models sport a third telephoto camera, allowing you to zoom in on a distant subject. Last but not least, the models have a faster USB-C connector that supports up to 10 Gb/s data transferring speeds.

You can easily find a refurbished iPhone 15 Pro on platforms like Best Buy, Walmart, and Amazon. Alternatively, you can purchase the phone from someone you know who has handled the phone with care. On the other hand, if you wish to get a new iPhone 15 Pro, Best Buy has a listing for you at $899.99 (if you activate the phone at the time of purchase with either AT&T or Verizon).

If you're moving to the iPhone 15, you might also want to know more about the cost of setting up an Apple ecosystem in 2025.

20 Products Apple Silently Discontinued in 2024,"2024 was a jam-packed year for Apple and its superfas. Apple launched its first-ever mixed-reality headset, first-ever AI iPhones, insanely capable M4 Macs, and more. After launching the newer versions, Apple generally discontinues the older products. As 2024 is ending, it's a good opportunity to look back at the devices and accessories Apple discontinued this year. Right from the four-year-old M1 MacBook Air to less-than-a-year-old iPhone woven cases, the Cupertino tech giant discontinued a total of 20 products in 2024. These products won't be available to purchase from the Apple Store, but you may find some nice deals from third-party resellers or Apple refurbished store.

Here are all the 20 products Apple officially discontinued in 2024.

Apple discontinued the classic, much-popular M1 MacBook Air (2020) in 2024. It was a special device because it was one of the first Macs powered by Apple Silicon and the last MacBook to feature a wedge-shaped design. Although Apple discontinued the M1 MacBook Air, you can buy it from third-party resellers and marketplaces for around $649. The M2 MacBook Air replaced the M1 MacBook Air in the lineup. As of now, Apple sells a 13-inch MacBook Air with M2 and M3 MacBook Air in 13-inch and 15-inch options.

Apple recently launched the newer and redesigned M4 Mac Mini which is smaller and more capable than the previous model. As soon as Apple launched the M4 model, it discontinued the previous M2 Mac mini. The latest M4 Mac Mini marks the first-ever major redesign of Apple's most portable desktop computer. Mac Mini now features an ultra-portable design, boosted 64GB RAM, Thunderbolt 5 support, frontal I/O ports, and comes in M4 & M4 Pro configurations. With such upgraded specifications, the M4 Mac Mini could become Apple's gaming console we've been waiting for years.

In October 2024, Apple replaced the M3 iMac with a new M4 iMac that boasts Apple Intelligence support and upgraded 16GB of RAM. With the jump from M3 to M4, the iMac also got additional Thunderbolt ports and the same Center Stage capability as MacBooks. Despite the boosted RAM of 16GB, the Me iMac has a starting price of $1,299. Now, Apple's all-in-one desktop computer comes in an array of playful colors, including orange, green, yellow, purple, pink, blue, and silver.

Following the release of the new MacBook Pros with M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max processors, Apple has discontinued the M3 MacBook Pro models. The new models come with 16GB base RAM, which is double the 8GB RAM found on the M3 models. Also, MacBook Pro models with M4 Pro and M4 Max come with Thunderbolt 3 connectivity so you can enjoy the blazingly fast transfer speeds up to 120 Gb/s. Furthermore, you can now configure your Mac with a nano-texture display.

Since the release of the iPhone XS in 2018, Apple has developed a habit of discontinuing the previous generation of flagship iPhones once the latest models are out. Continuing this tradition, Apple discontinued the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max after the release of the iPhone 16 series. While Apple doesn't sell the iPhone 15 Pro models, there are some solid reasons to grab one from a third-party reseller. First, the iPhone 15 Pro & iPhone 15 Pro Max are one of the few iPhone models with Apple Intelligence support. Second, the iPhone 15 Pro models are as good as the latest iPhone 16 Pro models, but you can own them at a discounted price.

Apple launched the iPhone 13 in 2021 with several upgrades like a smaller notch, an A15 Bionic chip, battery life improvements, and a new camera system. Also, the iPhone 13 got brand-new photography features like a Cinematic mode that blurs the background or foreground while keeping the objects in focus. Despite being a three-year-old device, the iPhone 13 was a popular option among users who wanted a sleek and affordable iPhone. However, Apple officially discontinued the iPhone 13 after the launch of the iPhone 16 lineup. The iPhone 13 started with a $799 price tag and reached an all-time low price of $599 before it disappeared from the Apple store shelves.

On the same day when Apple launched the new M4 iPad Pro and M2 iPad Air in May, it discontinued the ninth-generation, entry-level iPad. The iPad 9 looks a little outdated with a 10.2-inch Retina display and thick black bezels. The current entry-level iPad 10 features an updated design that matches the aesthetics of the iPad Air and iPad Pro models. Initially launched at $449, Apple slashed its price by $100 after it discontinued the iPad 9.

In October 2024, Apple replaced the iPad Mini 6 with a new model that can handle Apple Intelligence features. The iPad Mini 7 features an upgraded A17 Pro chipset, 8GB RAM, and Apple Pencil Pro compatibility. The new model might look similar to its predecessor in terms of design, but it's significantly powerful considering the performance upgrades and AI compatibility. Also, Apple fixed the infamous jelly-scrolling issue found on the previous iPad Mini 6 model.

Following the release of the thinner Apple Watch Series 10, Apple discontinued the older Apple Watch Series 9 which was launched last year. The tech titan probably did it because the new Apple Watch Series 10 has the same starting price as the Series 9. The Apple Watch Series 10 boasts a bigger display, a new S10 chip, improved battery life, and advanced health tracking features like Sleep Apnea detection. Although Series 9 has been discontinued, you can easily buy one from third-party retailers.

When Apple launched the new AirPods 4 and AirPods Max with USB-C, it replaced all the AirPods models with a Lightning port. This includes AirPods 2, AirPods 3, and AirPods Max (Lightning version). The giant launched two models of AirPods 4, an entry-level option for $129, and a higher-end model with active noise cancellation (ANC) at $179. The standard AirPods 4 are now the cheapest AirPods that Apple currently sells. On the flip side, AirPods Max with USB-C are the most premium, flagship over-the-ear headphones made by Apple.

Just like AirPods, Apple also replaced the Lightning Magic accessories with the new USB-C versions of Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Keyboard. However, the upgraded USB-C Magic Mouse still features a frustrating design with the charging port on the bottom. You can find the Lightning versions of Magic accessories, but it won't be a practical option as you would want to invest in future-proof accessories that you can keep for a long time.

Back in August, the Superdrive went out of stock on Apple's US website, and after that, it was sold out or unavailable in all the countries. It seems Apple has silently discontinued its 16-year-old accessory. Superdrive was first introduced in 2008 as an external CD/DVD drive alongside the original MacBook Air that lacked a built-in CD drive. Despite an outdated USB-A cable attached to it, Superdrive was one of the longest-sold Apple products.

Last year, Apple discontinued its leather iPhone cases and introduced the FineWoven cases as a more environmentally friendly option. It was meant to deliver a premium in-hand feel. However, it completely missed the mark. The FineWoven cases for iPhone 15 got a backlash over quality and durability concerns. It seems Apple has acknowledged this and discontinued the FineWoven iPhone cases. It didn't launch any FibneWoven cases for the iPhone 16 lineup.

After selling the Powerbeats Pro for over five years, Apple discontinued these wireless earbuds in October 2024. Powerbeats Pro was sold as a fitness-focused alternative to AirPods Pro with built-in ear hooks which can be adjusted for a secure fit. These wireless earbuds offered IPX4-rated sweat and water resistance, nine hours of battery life, and silicon ear tips in four size options. You can easily find Powerbeats Pro on Amazon and other marketplaces.

Back in 2016, Apple ditched the headphone jack with the iPhone 7 and included a lightning adapter right in the box. Ever since then, users have relied on the Lightning to 3.5mm adapter to connect their wired headphones. Until the iPhone X, Apple provided the adapter in the box, and after that users had to buy it separately. However, just like the Superdrive, Apple silently discontinued the Lightning to Headphone jack adapter. Initially the little adapter disappeared from the US stores, and now it is unavailable globally. Well, the reason is pretty straightforward. Apple has ditched the lightning port in favor of the USB-C port on iPhone 15 and later models, and it offers a USB-C version of the adapter. Since none of the new iPhones feature lightning ports, it makes sense for Apple to discontinue the Lightning to 3.5mm adapter.

Those were the 20 Apple products discontinued in 2o24. You can eaily find the latest versions of these products. In case your favorite Apple product is on the list or don't mind going for a refurbished model, you can find some deals on the discontinued Apple stuff.",Beebom,https://beebom.com/products-apple-discontinued-2024/,2025-01-02,

Could a redesigned iPhone SE be coming in 2025?

Apple fans⁤ hoping for a ⁢more affordable iPhone with a modern design might be in luck. Rumors ⁣are swirling about a new iPhone SE model launching in spring 2025, potentially bringing a much-needed refresh to Apple's budget-friendly line.

(Image credit: ⁤AppleTrack / @conceptcentral)

Its been three⁢ years as the last iPhone SE update, ⁣and whispers suggest apple is ready to shake things up. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, known for his reliable Apple scoops, predicts a spring⁤ 2025 launch,⁤ aligning with the release ⁣pattern of ⁣previous SE⁤ models.A⁤ Fresh Look for the Budget iPhone

The current iPhone SE, while powerful, sports an outdated design ⁤with thick bezels and a small 4.7-inch screen. The iPhone SE 4 is rumored to ditch this look for a more modern aesthetic, featuring a larger 6.1-inch edge-to-edge display and a notch to house Face ⁣ID⁤ sensors and the front camera.

This design overhaul would bring the ⁤SE in line with Apple's current iPhone lineup, offering ⁢a more immersive viewing experience and a sleeker look.

OLED Upgrade and More

Beyond the design changes, the iPhone SE 4 is also expected to receive a significant display upgrade. Rumors suggest apple will swap the current LCD panel for a vibrant OLED screen, delivering richer colors and deeper blacks.

while details⁢ are still scarce, the iPhone SE 4 promises to be⁤ a compelling option for budget-conscious consumers seeking ⁤a modern iPhone experience without breaking the bank.

Apple fans have long clamored for a larger, more affordable iPhone ⁤option, and rumors⁣ suggest their wish may soon be granted.⁤ Whispers from the tech world point to ⁤Apple potentially releasing not one, but two iPhone SE models in the near future:⁢ a standard iPhone SE and a larger ""Plus"" variant.The iPhone SE Plus is generating significant buzz,promising a bigger display without the premium price tag of Apple's flagship iPhones.This move could be a game-changer for Apple,⁤ allowing them to capture a wider audience seeking a balance between affordability and screen real estate.

A Powerful Punch in a Larger Package

While details ⁢remain scarce, speculation suggests the iPhone SE Plus will boast a significant upgrade under ⁤the hood. It's rumored to be powered by ⁣apple's ⁣latest A18 chip, the same powerhouse ⁣found ⁢in the upcoming iPhone 16. This would⁢ translate to⁢ a substantial⁤ performance boost, ⁤enabling smoother multitasking, faster app loading, and enhanced gaming experiences.

Furthermore, the iPhone⁢ SE Plus is tipped to be the first iPhone to feature Apple's own 5G modem,⁣ potentially leading to improved network speeds and connectivity.

The Price ⁤is Right?

The larger display, powerful ⁤processor, and potential switch to OLED technology suggest the iPhone SE Plus won't come cheap. However, Apple is⁢ likely to position it strategically to ⁤remain competitive in the mid-range market.

With the discounted iPhone 14 currently retailing for $599, it's reasonable to expect the iPhone SE Plus to land somewhere in the $499⁣ range.This would make it a compelling option for ⁣budget-conscious consumers who desire a larger screen and flagship-level performance.A Winning Formula?

The iPhone SE Plus has the potential to be⁢ a major success for Apple. By offering a larger display, powerful performance, and⁤ a competitive price point, it could attract a new wave of iPhone users.

Only time will tell if these rumors materialize, but the prospect of a big-screen iPhone SE Plus is certainly exciting news⁤ for Apple enthusiasts.

Google's Pixel A series⁣ has become a popular choice for budget-conscious consumers seeking a taste of flagship features without the premium price tag. Now, rumors are swirling about the upcoming⁣ Pixel 9a, promising another compelling option in the mid-range market.When Can We Expect It?

Breaking from ⁤tradition, Google surprised everyone by releasing the Pixel 8a before its annual developer conference, Google I/O, in 2024. While it's unclear if history⁣ will repeat itself, most predictions point to a ⁢Pixel⁢ 9a launch no later than May, with some whispers suggesting a mid-March announcement. This accelerated timeline could be linked to Google's decision⁣ to⁢ release the android 16 update earlier than ⁢usual.

What's ⁢Under the Hood?

Don't expect groundbreaking⁤ innovations with the Pixel 9a. Google ⁣typically uses this series to⁤ bring existing AI capabilities to a wider audience. the ⁢Pixel 9a is likely to adopt the Tensor G4 chipset, the same⁤ powerhouse found in the Pixel 9 flagships, enabling access to the latest AI-driven⁢ features.

However, rumors suggest a design refresh, with the signature camera bar shrinking ⁤into a more compact oval camera array on the left side of the phone. A leaked spec sheet indicates a potential downgrade in the main camera, swapping the pixel 8a's 64MP sensor for a 48MP ⁢one.while this might seem like a⁤ step back on paper,the new sensor could⁤ offer ⁢other ⁢advancements beyond megapixel⁣ count.

to keep ⁤costs down, the ⁤Pixel 9a might also forgo the ⁢newer modem found in the Pixel 9, potentially eliminating the Satellite SOS feature for emergency messaging.

The Price Tag

The good news is that Google's cost-cutting measures could translate into a continued starting⁢ price of $499, matching the Pixel 8a. This would pit the pixel 9a directly against ⁤the iPhone ⁢SE 4, setting the stage for an epic battle to determine the best budget-friendly smartphone.

The Pixel⁤ 9a promises to deliver a compelling blend⁣ of AI-powered features and affordability, making it a strong contender in the competitive mid-range⁢ market.

Could a more affordable foldable phone be on the horizon? ⁤ Rumors are swirling that Samsung is developing a ""Fan Edition"" ⁤of its popular Galaxy Z Flip, potentially bringing the foldable experience to a wider audience.

While Samsung ⁣hasn't officially confirmed the Galaxy Z Flip FE, industry insiders suggest it could arrive⁤ sometime in ⁤2025. This follows a pattern⁣ established by Samsung, which has⁣ previously released ""Fan Edition"" versions⁢ of its flagship⁢ galaxy S series phones, offering a more budget-friendly ⁣option.

The Galaxy Z Flip FE is expected to retain the signature ⁣clamshell design ⁤of the Z flip series, but with potentially less premium materials and specifications to keep the price down. This could make foldable ⁣technology more accessible to a wider range of consumers.

Samsung's upcoming Galaxy Unpacked ⁢event,⁣ scheduled for later this year, ⁣could⁤ offer a glimpse of the Galaxy Z Flip FE. However, a full⁣ release might be delayed untill later in 2025, possibly alongside the ⁤next generation Galaxy Z Flip⁤ 7.

the potential arrival of a more affordable foldable phone could be a game-changer for the market, potentially driving wider adoption of this innovative technology.

Could a budget-friendly foldable phone be⁤ on the horizon? Samsung is reportedly shifting its focus to a more affordable version of ⁢its popular ⁤Galaxy Z Flip, potentially dubbed the Galaxy Z Flip FE. This move comes as the company aims to make⁣ foldable technology accessible to a wider audience.

While rumors of a cheaper Galaxy Z Fold have⁣ circulated, ⁤Samsung ⁣seems to⁢ be prioritizing the Z ⁤Flip line for its affordability push. The strategy mirrors the company's approach with the Galaxy S24 FE, a more budget-conscious version of its flagship S24 smartphone.

Cutting Costs without Compromising Quality

Samsung⁤ is ⁣likely to employ similar cost-saving measures for the Galaxy Z Flip FE. this could involve using a less⁢ powerful Exynos processor instead of the latest Snapdragon chip,scaling back on camera specifications,or opting for ⁤more cost-effective materials.

However, Samsung will likely⁤ aim to maintain the core features that make the Z Flip series so appealing, such as its compact design and foldable functionality.

Targeting the Sub-$1,000 Market

The primary goal of the Galaxy Z flip FE is to undercut the price ⁢of the standard Z Flip, which saw a price increase to $1,099 with the release of the Galaxy Z Flip ⁣6. Samsung is likely aiming for a price point ⁤below $1,000, potentially targeting the $699 Motorola razr (2024), currently⁢ considered the best foldable phone on the market in terms of value.

A Foldable Future for Everyone?

The potential arrival of a more affordable Galaxy Z Flip FE could be ⁢a⁢ game-changer⁤ for the⁢ foldable phone market. By making this innovative technology more accessible, Samsung could accelerate the adoption of foldables and pave the way⁢ for a future where ⁢these devices become mainstream.

Could Samsung be about to unveil its slimmest smartphone yet? Rumors are swirling about the potential arrival of the Galaxy S25 Slim,a device that promises to redefine what's possible in terms of phone thinness.

While Samsung hasn't officially ⁢confirmed the existence of the S25 Slim, whispers ⁢suggest⁤ it could make a surprise ⁤appearance at ⁣the⁣ company's unpacked event in January. However, don't expect to get your hands on it right away.Some rumors point to an April release,while others suggest a June launch.

thin is In: A ⁤Focus on Design

The ""Slim"" in the name hints at the phone's biggest selling point: its incredibly thin profile.Speculation suggests Samsung is aiming⁢ for ⁣a thickness of just 5.6mm, rivaling the⁢ unfolded thinness of the galaxy Z Fold 6.

Achieving such a slim design might come with trade-offs. The powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite⁢ chipset, found in many⁣ flagship phones, ⁢may generate to much heat for such a compact⁢ device. As ⁣a result, rumors suggest the S25 Slim could ⁣feature an older Exynos 2400 chip instead.

Camera Prowess Despite the Slim⁣ Profile

Despite the potential limitations of its size, Samsung is reportedly not skimping on camera ⁤technology. Rumors indicate the S25 Slim could boast a 200MP main lens, matching the impressive camera found on the current Galaxy⁢ S23 Ultra.A⁢ Slim Chance for a Big Impact?

The Galaxy S25 Slim has the potential to be a ⁤game-changer in the smartphone market. If Samsung can deliver on the promise of a truly thin device without sacrificing performance or camera ⁤quality, it could set a new standard for phone⁢ design.

Only time will tell if the S25⁣ Slim lives up to the hype. But one thing is for sure: Samsung ⁢is pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the world of smartphones.## Samsung's Slimmed-Down Galaxy S25: A Phone for⁣ Minimalists?

Rumors are swirling about a potential new addition to Samsung's Galaxy S25 lineup: the Galaxy S25 Slim. This⁢ rumored phone is generating buzz for ⁤its focus on ⁤a sleek,compact design,potentially sacrificing some features for a more pocket-friendly experience.

While details are scarce, whispers suggest the Galaxy ⁢S25 Slim could⁤ boast a single, high-resolution camera lens, a departure from the multi-lens setups common in flagship phones. This streamlined approach could appeal to ⁤users who prioritize a minimalist aesthetic and ease of use.

Adding fuel to the fire, some rumors ⁤suggest the Galaxy S25 Slim might⁣ not ⁣be a widely available device. It's possible Samsung could release it in limited markets as a test run before a potential wider release in 2026.

Pricing details remain a mystery, but speculation points to the Galaxy⁣ S25 Slim potentially being positioned as a more affordable option compared to the standard S25⁢ lineup.

the emergence⁢ of the Galaxy S25 Slim, if true, could signal a shift in consumer preferences towards smaller, more manageable phones. It also highlights ⁢Samsung's willingness to experiment with different form⁢ factors and price points to cater to a wider range of users.

OnePlus ⁤is gearing up to release its second-generation foldable phone, the OnePlus Open 2, and anticipation ⁣is building among⁣ tech enthusiasts. While ⁢the official launch date remains under wraps, rumors and leaks suggest a late 2023 or early 2024 release.The OnePlus Open 2 is expected to be a significant upgrade over its predecessor,the OnePlus open,which ⁣launched in August 2022.

One of the⁢ most anticipated improvements is the processor. The OnePlus Open 2 is rumored to be powered by the Snapdragon ⁤8 Gen⁢ 2 Elite, a⁢ significant leap from the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 ⁤found in the original OnePlus Open. This upgrade promises a noticeable boost in performance and efficiency.

OnePlus is also reportedly focusing on making the Open 2 thinner and more ⁣portable. This could address⁢ one⁢ of the main criticisms of foldable phones, which often feel bulky compared to customary smartphones.

Battery⁣ life is another area where OnePlus is expected to make improvements.Leaks suggest a larger ⁣battery capacity to address the power demands of the larger foldable screen.

Adding to the appeal, the OnePlus Open 2 might also feature an IP68 rating for water resistance. This would be a welcome addition, reassuring users about the phone's durability and ability to withstand everyday wear and tear.

While camera rumors ⁣are less prevalent, there are whispers of a slight bump in the main camera resolution from 48MP to 50MP. The 3x⁤ zoom lens is expected to make a return,⁣ offering users versatility in capturing⁢ different perspectives.

Foldable phones remain a premium segment, and the OnePlus Open 2 is unlikely to buck that trend. Though, OnePlus has a history of offering competitive⁢ pricing, ⁣so ⁣we can expect the Open 2 to be priced lower than rivals ⁢like the google Pixel Fold and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6.

The OnePlus Open 2 is poised to be a strong contender in the growing foldable phone market. With⁣ its rumored performance upgrades, design refinements, and competitive pricing, it could be ⁢a ⁣compelling option for consumers looking for a unique and innovative smartphone experience.

Samsung is gearing up for another round of foldable phone releases ⁤in 2025, and early rumors⁢ suggest some exciting upgrades are on the horizon.

While the exact launch date remains a mystery, Samsung typically unveils its new foldables in july or August. ⁤With no Summer Olympics to influence the timing this year, we might see a return to a more ⁢traditional release schedule.

Bigger is Better: Expect⁣ Expanded displays

One of the most anticipated changes is the rumored increase in screen ⁢size. Taking⁢ inspiration from⁣ a special edition Galaxy Z Fold 6 released exclusively in korea, Samsung is reportedly planning to equip the Galaxy Z Fold 7 with an expansive⁣ 8-inch ⁤main display and a 6.5-inch cover screen.

The Galaxy Z Flip 7 ⁣is also expected to get a display upgrade,⁢ with a foldable 6.85-inch panel replacing the current 6.7-inch screen. This would provide users with even more screen real estate for multitasking, gaming, and media consumption.

Slimmed ⁣Down Design: A Thinner⁤ Fold

Beyond larger displays, Samsung is reportedly aiming to make the Galaxy Z Fold 7 as thin as the 8.6mm Galaxy S24 Ultra when folded.⁣ This would mean shaving a significant 3.5mm off the thickness of the Galaxy Z Fold 6,making it more pocket-friendly ⁣and ⁢pleasant to hold.

Chip Change: Exynos Takes the Stage?

Rumors also suggest that Samsung might ⁣ditch Qualcomm's Snapdragon⁢ 8 Elite system-on-chip for⁤ the Galaxy Z Flip 7, opting instead for its own latest Exynos silicon. This could potentially⁤ lead to⁤ improved performance and battery life, but it remains to be seen how this change will impact real-world usage.

The Price Question: Will Foldables Become More Affordable?

Last year, Samsung raised ⁤the prices of both the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6 ⁤by $100. hopefully, this was a one-time ⁤adjustment, and we might see more competitive pricing for the 2025 models. Though, there are ⁤no concrete pricing rumors yet.

with these exciting upgrades on the⁢ horizon, samsung's 2025 foldable phones are shaping up to be some of⁤ the most innovative and⁤ desirable devices on the market. Whether you're a foldable enthusiast or⁤ simply curious about the future of smartphones, these releases are definately worth keeping an eye on.

Could a radical⁤ redesign be in store for Google's next flagship phone?

While the leaked⁢ case doesn't reveal the full design of the Pixel 10, ⁢the enlarged camera bar is a striking change. It hints at Google's continued focus⁢ on photography, a hallmark ⁢of the Pixel⁣ series.

The Pixel ⁤9, released in August 2024, already boasted impressive camera capabilities, earning praise for its image quality and AI-powered ⁤features. A larger⁢ camera bar could indicate even more advanced sensors and lenses, potentially pushing ⁢the boundaries of smartphone photography even further.

When can we expect the Pixel 10?

Google's release schedule for its Pixel phones has been somewhat unpredictable in ⁢recent years. After sticking to an ⁢october launch for several generations, the Pixel 9 arrived in August 2024, a move likely aimed at ⁣getting ahead of Apple's iPhone releases.

Whether Google will maintain⁤ this earlier launch window for the ⁢Pixel 10 remains to be seen. Rumors are still scarce, but tech enthusiasts are eagerly awaiting more details about Google's next flagship device.

The leaked case images have certainly piqued interest, suggesting that the Pixel 10⁢ could be⁣ a significant upgrade over its predecessor. With Google's track record of⁣ innovation, the Pixel 10 has the potential to be one of the most exciting⁤ smartphones of 2025.

This could translate to significant performance improvements and enhanced power efficiency.

Rumors suggest the Pixel 10 ⁢will sport⁤ a design similar to its predecessor, the Pixel 9, featuring a⁢ horizontal camera bar with rounded edges. ⁢This⁢ design language appears ⁢to be distinct from the rumored look of the ⁣more affordable Pixel 9a, which⁤ is said to have a more compact camera bar.

Pricing for the Pixel 10 series remains a ⁤mystery, ⁣but given the recent price increases⁤ for the pixel 9⁣ and Pixel 9 Pro, it's possible Google will maintain a premium pricing strategy.

Apple's iPhone remains a dominant force in ⁤the smartphone market,and the iPhone 17 series is expected to be another major release. While details are scarce,rumors suggest Apple may introduce a new ⁣""Air""⁤ model alongside the standard iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro.

Familiar Faces, New Features:

The iPhone 17 lineup is expected to include the standard iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max, mirroring the current generation. Rumors suggest all three models⁤ will retain their current screen sizes, but the entry-level iPhone 17 ⁣could finally get a ProMotion display with a buttery-smooth 120Hz refresh rate.

Under the hood,all iPhones are likely to be powered by the A19 chip,with the Pro models boasting more RAM for enhanced performance. The iPhone 17 Pro Max might⁣ see all three rear cameras upgraded to 48MP sensors, while the iPhone 17 Pro's camera upgrades remain uncertain.

A New contender: The iPhone 17 Air

iPhone 16 Plus Review: Smart gets Smarter,"iPhones have always been trendsetters in the smartphone industry. Be it ditching the charger, for which Samsung had mocked the company at the time, or introducing the Dynamic Island notch or the Face ID, Apple's smartphones have introduced features that have been copied by Android smartphones across price points. But this year was different. Apple, instead of setting a new trend, followed Android phones in introducing a feature that has upgraded the terminology used by the mobile phone industry -- artificial intelligence or AI.

For those who have been away from the news world, Apple brought AI, or as the company likes to call it Apple Intelligence, to its iPhone models for the first time this year. However, in classic Apple fashion, the company didn't restrict itself to throwing features such as AI Eraser, AI Summary and AI Deblur or bringing 'native support' for ChatGPT app to its iPhones. Instead, it went a step ahead by integrating ChatGPT in its operating system. Result was an app such as Image Playground that let users create images from scratch and smarter features such as contextual and on-screen awareness for Siri and ChatGPT integration within Apple's apps and services -- besides bringing AI eraser and AI summary to the mix.

While these features do bring Apple's iPhones up to date with the existing trends in the smartphone industry, they also make you wonder if 'AI phones' have a utility over the existing smartphones, barring some features, of course. We will try to answer that question and many more in our detailed review of the iPhone 16 Plus below, so keep reading!

Display: 6.7-inch Super Retina XDR OLED display with a resolution of 2796 x 1290 pixels and 2,000 nits of peak brightness

Processor and Storage: Apple's A18 chip with up to 512GB of storage space

Camera: 48MP Fusion + 12MP Ultra-Wide cameras at the back, 12MP TrueDepth camera in the front

The iPhone 16 Plus looks and feels almost like last year's iPhone 15 Plus, which means you get the same classic flat-screen piece of glass that is encased in an aluminum chassis. Despite the similarity in the overall design, there are some subtle and some not-so-subtle changes that Apple has made this year.

For instance, Apple has made the rear camera module a tad bit slimmer this year. The iPhone 15 Plus came with a square-shaped camera module. On the other hand, the iPhone 16 Plus comes with a pill-shaped camera module. While it doesn't make a world of difference, at least not in terms of any practical aspect, it does look a bit cleaner in terms of the overall aesthetics. Nothing major.

An area where the company has made a major change is in terms of the side buttons. The iPhone 16 Plus has a new camera button on the right side, something that is exclusive to the iPhone 16 series, and an Action Button, which replaces the Ring/Silent slider and was available only in the iPhone 15 Pro models. Both these buttons make a noticeable change in the way this smartphone is used.

For starters, the Action Button can be anything you want it to be -- Silent button, Camera, Flashlight, Voice Memo, Translator or a Magnifier to name a few. You can also set it to access a control of your choice with a single click -- making it one of the most important features that Apple has introduced in its iPhones this year.

The camera button, on the other hand, is a tricky one. Sure, it is designed to make it easier for users to click images in landscape mode, but it also gives them access to a host of other controls such as Tone, Style, Camera, Zoom, Exposure and Depth, which is where it can get a bit confusing. What Apple is trying to do with the camera button is change its users' habits, which takes time and patience. So, what might seem unnecessary today might become a necessity tomorrow. Simply put, it does take time for you to get used to using the Camera button, especially beyond the Click and Capture functionality.

Next up, is the display.

Apple has followed the 'don't fix what's not broken' strategy when it comes to the display of its iPhone 16 Plus model. This means with the iPhone 16 Plus, you get the same display technology as last year's iPhone 15 Plus. Well, almost.

But what does that mean? It means that the screen is bright and the colours are vibrant no matter what the daylight conditions are. Whether you are scrolling through your social media feed when the lights are out or you are reading an important email under the harsh Delhi sun, the display is comfortable to read at all times. The bigger screen (compared to the iPhone 16) makes watching TV shows and movies a pleasure. This iPhone model, like its predecessor, supports HDR technology, which is ideal for watching TV shows and movies on Netflix.

Now the part that is different. Unlike the iPhone 15 Plus, Apple's iPhone 16 Plus model supports a minimum brightness of 1 nit. This brings true black colours to your screen. But more than that, it ensures that you can use your iPhone in the dark without disturbing people around you.

Let's talk about the iPhone 16 Plus experience now.

Apple has been shipping its 'Plus' iPhone model with the chip available in its year-old Pro models since it launched the iPhone 14 series back in 2022. However, this year, the company strayed away from this trend by launching the iPhone 16 Plus with the updated A18 chipset while keeping the A18 Pro chip to its iPhone 16 Pro models. This marks one of the biggest upgrades that the company has brought to its base level iPhone models, which includes the iPhone 16 Plus.

Apple says that the CPU of its A18 chip is 30 percent faster and power-efficient than the A16 Bionic. In effect, the iPhone 16 Plus is quick to respond to anything that you throw at it and it handles everything with grace and poise - nothing you don't expect an iPhone to do. But the real game-changer here is the iOS 18, which brings tons of customisation options to the iPhone 16 Plus - a factor that has been a point of constant comparison with the Android OS.

With iOS 18, iPhone 16 Plus users can customise their Home Screen in a way that accentuates their wallpaper, choose the colour and size of the app icons, access apps and tools more easily through Control Centre and even choose exactly what they want to do with the Action Button. Apple's new mobile OS also helps iPhone 16 Plus users sort through their photos by grouping them into meaningful collections based on dates, people and places among other things.

In addition to this, iOS 18 has also upgraded the Phone app with features such as transcription for live calls and native call recorder support -- another factor that has remained a pain point for iPhone users for a long time. Simply put, the iPhone 16 Plus with iOS 18 is a power performer and a game changer.

iOS 18 also brings Apple Intelligence to the iPhone 16 Plus - a feature that marks Apple's foray in the era of AI (artificial intelligence) phones.

Apple has always been good at weaving in utilitarian tools (Password Sharing, Share Play, and Name Drop to name a few) in its mobile OS that are thoughtful, especially from the day-to-day usage perspective of the end user. These tools make using iPhones an intuitive experience. They also make the end users come back to iPhones and Apple's ecosystem generation after generation. With Apple Intelligence, Apple has tried to replicate the same trend.

For instance, you get Genmojis that let users create emojis of their choice using AI, Image Playground app that lets users create images based on text-based prompts, Image Editing tools in the Photos app that bring features like AI eraser to the users, and the Writing Tools that let users proofread, rewrite and even write text from scratch all thanks to Apple's ChatGPT integration.

While these tools bring the intelligence that iOS is known for, they are not as refined as they should be, especially given the recent advancements in AI and ML. To give you some context, Apple's Image Playground app isn't exactly user friendly and images that it reproduces aren't as refined as the one produced by other AI tools, such as Meta AI and Copilot in Microsoft's Edge browser, that are also available for free. A lot of times, the app also fails to create relevant images. Then there are the writing tools. While the proofreads are fine, the tool isn't exactly articulate when it comes to original work. On the other hand, features such as Genmoji, AI Eraser and natural language support, work just fine.

The story doesn't end there. Apple is yet to roll out a host of Apple Intelligence powered tools, such as on-screen understanding and contextual awareness for Siri among others, that will make using AI or Apple Intelligence more natural.

The point here is that Apple needs to refine its AI tools a lot in order to catch up to the existing technology.

Apple doesn't disclose the battery capacity of its iPhone models. What it does share is the stats under various usage conditions, which gives you a rough idea as to whether or not the company has increased the battery capacity of its iPhone model. For instance, the iPhone 16 Plus offers up to 27 hours of video playback time when the video is stored on-device and up to 24 hours of time when the video is streamed, which is slightly more than what the company offers in case of the iPhone 15 Plus.

In usage, the iPhone 16 Plus offers a long battery life that will easily last for a day-and-a-half on day-to-day usage, which includes 1-2 hours of OTT time and 3-4 hours of social media time. And over the weekend, when the usage decreases significantly, the battery can also last up to almost two days. But of course, this time varies based on individual usage.

Apple hasn't made any major changes to the camera of the iPhone 16 Plus. This means you get the same 48MP primary camera at the back with an aperture of f/1.6 and a 12MP ultra-wide-angle camera, which gets a slightly faster aperture of f2.2 -- the only change Apple has made to the rear camera module this year. On the front, the iPhone 16 Plus still gets a 12MP camera with a f/1.9 aperture. While the company hasn't made many changes on the hardware front, it has thrown a bunch of features such as spatial photos, spatial videos and wind noise reduction to the mix, to make it a bit lucrative for the buyers. Nothing ground-breaking though.

In usage, the iPhone does a fairly good job at capturing images under various lighting conditions. Both the primary and the ultra-wide-angle cameras maintain colours, clarity and details while capturing images in low-light conditions. There is minimum noise when capturing the night sky and Apple's camera algorithm does a decent job at enhancing the subject or the light source.

When there is ample light, the camera manages to capture small details with great precision while offering a decent dynamic range. Same is the case with colour reproduction. The front-facing camera is equally adept at capturing images under various lighting conditions. It manages to preserve colours and details while capably distinguishing between each disheveled strand of hair efficiently.

The ground-breaking or at least the upgraded part this year is the Camera app that offers easy access to in-app camera filter menu. Menu, because the iPhone 16 Plus users can now customise the effect that they want to use using a touchpad-looking menu. An even bigger update is the Camera button on the right side that takes some time getting used to. This camera button gives users access to granular camera controls such as exposure, depth, zoom, cameras, styles and tones. While the controls offered by the Camera button give users enough room to play around while capturing images and videos, don't expect to use it with a single hand, at least not right away, as Apple shows in its ads.

To answer the question in one word: Yes.

The non-Pro iPhone models usually fall short in offering potential buyers a meaningful upgrade to their old smartphones or in many cases iPhones. A slightly dated processor along with Apple's strategy of reserving its new features for the Pro iPhone models make the non-Pro iPhone models a less lucrative buy. However, Apple changed that with the iPhone 16 Plus.

The iPhone 16 Plus not only comes with the Camera and Action buttons but also one of Apple's most hyped features this year, that is, Apple Intelligence. Sure, the company hasn't made any major changes to the camera system but the quirky features that the company has included this time more than make up for it. Also, Apple Intelligence does need a lot of refining but that is not restricted to iPhone 16 Plus.",Republic World,https://www.republicworld.com/tech/gadgets/iphone-16-plus-review-smart-gets-smarter,2024-12-31,
Apple Cancels iPhone 14 And iPhone SE For Millions Of Customers - News Directory 3,"Apple has removed iPhone models with Lightning connectors from sale in all 27 EU member states, plus Switzerland, following a new EU directive mandating USB-C charging ports for electronic devices. The move, effective December 28, 2024, impacts the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, and iPhone SE 3rd generation.

the EU directive, aimed at reducing electronic waste, requires manufacturers too standardize charging ports across a range of devices, including smartphones, tablets, and cameras. Apple, which initially resisted the change, has since transitioned its iPhone 15 lineup and other products, such as iPads and AirPods, to USB-C charging.

A Newsdirectory3.com examination confirmed the removal of the Lightning iPhone models from Apple's online stores across all 27 EU countries,as well as Switzerland.

In the UK, the situation is slightly different. While the iPhone 14 and iPhone SE 3rd generation are still listed on Apple's UK website, attempting to purchase them redirects users to a ""page not found"" message. This suggests a phased rollout of the new regulations in the UK.

The EU-wide removal of Lightning iPhones has sparked speculation about Apple's future product designs. Rumors suggest the upcoming iPhone 17 Pro coudl ditch physical buttons altogether, opting for solid-state buttons similar to those found on the iPhone 7's home button.

The EU-wide Removal

The EU's move to standardize charging ports is a significant step towards reducing electronic waste and consumer inconvenience. By mandating USB-C,the EU aims to create a more enduring and user-amiable tech landscape.

A Phased impact on the UK

while the UK is not yet fully subject to the EU directive, the phased removal of Lightning iPhones from Apple's UK website suggests the country is moving towards alignment with the EU regulations.

Apple's Stance and The Future of Charging

Apple has publicly stated its commitment to complying with the EU directive. The company's transition to USB-C across its product line demonstrates its willingness to adapt to evolving industry standards.

The Price of Progress: Budget-Conscious Consumers Impacted

The removal of budget-friendly Lightning iPhone models from the EU market raises concerns for consumers seeking affordable options. With the iPhone SE 3rd generation no longer available, budget-conscious buyers may have to consider pricier alternatives.

New EU Charging Rules Force Tech Giant to Pull Popular Models

Apple has removed its most affordable iPhone models, the iPhone SE and iPhone 14, from sale in the European Union, leaving budget-conscious consumers with fewer options. The move comes as a direct result of new EU regulations requiring all smartphones to use USB-C charging ports by the end of 2024.

The iPhone SE and iPhone 14, which feature Apple's proprietary Lightning connector, are no longer available for purchase on Apple's websites across all 27 EU member states.

This decision has significant implications for consumers seeking a more affordable entry point into the iPhone ecosystem. the iPhone SE, priced at $429, was a popular choice for its value proposition. With its removal, the cheapest iPhone available is now the iPhone 15, starting at $699.

""it's frustrating,"" said one consumer in Berlin. ""The SE was a great option for peopel like me who wanted an iPhone without breaking the bank. Now, it feels like Apple is pushing everyone towards their more expensive models.""

While Apple has pulled the affected models from its own stores, third-party retailers may still have stock available. Websites like Amazon are currently selling the iPhone 14 in some European countries.However, these supplies are likely to be limited.

The EU's charging regulations are being closely watched by other countries considering similar legislation. While the immediate impact outside of Europe is expected to be minimal, the long-term implications for Apple's product lineup remain to be seen.

Rumors suggest that Apple is working on a fourth-generation iPhone SE, potentially launching in early 2025. However, reports indicate that this new model may not be as budget-friendly as its predecessor.

For now, European consumers looking for an affordable iPhone face a limited selection. The removal of the SE and iPhone 14 highlights the growing tension between consumer choice, technological standardization, and corporate strategy.

rumors Swirl About a Radical Design Change for Apple's Next Flagship Phone

Apple fans are buzzing with anticipation for the iPhone 17 Pro, expected to launch in late 2024. But this year,the excitement is tinged with a healthy dose of curiosity,as whispers of a dramatic design overhaul gain momentum.

The latest reports suggest Apple might be ditching the physical buttons on the iPhone 17 Pro, replacing them with solid-state buttons that provide haptic feedback. This move would mark a significant departure from the iPhone's iconic design, which has remained largely unchanged for over a decade.

While Apple has yet to confirm these rumors, industry insiders believe the switch to solid-state buttons could offer several advantages.""Solid-state buttons are more durable and water-resistant than customary physical buttons,"" said one source familiar with Apple's plans. ""Thay also allow for more precise control and customization of haptic feedback.""

Apple has removed all iPhone models with Lightning connectors from sale in the European Union, marking a significant shift in the consumer electronics landscape. This move comes in response to a new EU directive mandating USB-C charging ports for a wide range of electronic devices. The directive aims to reduce electronic waste and streamline consumer experiences.

As of December 28th, 2024, the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, and iPhone SE 3rd generation are no longer available for purchase on Apple's online stores across all 27 EU member states, plus Switzerland. This confirms a complete removal of these lightning-equipped models from the EU market.

the impact is also being felt in the UK, although in a more phased manner. While the iPhone 14 and iPhone SE 3rd generation remain listed on Apple's UK website, attempting to purchase them results in a ""page not found"" error. This suggests a complete removal of Lightning iPhones in the UK is imminent.

Apple initially expressed reservations about the EU directive, arguing that it could stifle innovation. Though, the company has as embraced USB-C charging in its latest iPad models and is expected to transition its entire iPhone lineup to the new standard in the coming years.

This move by apple signals a broader shift in the tech industry towards standardized charging solutions. Consumers can expect to see more devices adopting USB-C in the future, leading to greater convenience and reduced electronic waste.

Apple has finally bowed to EU pressure, ditching its proprietary Lightning port for the global USB-C standard on its latest iPhone 15 lineup and other devices like iPads and AirPods. This move, while lauded for its potential to simplify charging and reduce electronic waste, has left some consumers feeling squeezed.

The most notable casualty of this transition is the absence of Apple's most affordable iPhone models, the iPhone SE and iPhone 14, from the European market. These Lightning-equipped devices served as crucial entry points into Apple's ecosystem for budget-conscious consumers, offering essential features at a more accessible price point.

""It's frustrating,"" said Sarah Miller, a college student who was saving up for an iPhone SE. ""Now I either have to spend more on a newer model or look at other brands, which I wasn't really planning on doing.""

The EU's push for a universal charging standard aims to reduce electronic waste and consumer frustration by eliminating the need for multiple chargers. While this move is undoubtedly beneficial for the environment and user convenience, it has created a dilemma for budget-minded consumers who relied on Apple's more affordable Lightning-equipped options.

It remains to be seen how Apple will address this gap in its european lineup. Will they introduce USB-C versions of their budget models, or will consumers be forced to choose between pricier alternatives or switching brands entirely? Only time will tell.

What to Expect From Apple in 2025,"This guide outlines everything that we know about the new products coming from Apple in 2025, based on current rumors.

It'll come as no surprise, but this September, Apple will unveil the iPhone 17 lineup. Apple is making some major changes to its flagship models this year, eliminating the iPhone 17 Plus and introducing a new ultra thin model.

In 2024, Apple introduced a super thin iPad Pro that's just 5.1mm thick, and it's part of a new trend toward making products thinner and lighter. Instead of an iPhone 17 Plus, this year we're getting a super thin iPhone 17 that'll be something of a hybrid between the standard iPhone 17 and the iPhone 17 Pro in terms of price.

We don't yet know what Apple will call the new iPhone, but rumors have been referencing it as the ""iPhone 17 Air,"" and the ""Air"" name fits in with the ""Pro"" naming that Apple already uses for the iPhone lineup.

The iPhone 17 Air will mark the biggest update to the iPhone's design we've had since the iPhone X launched in 2017. The iPhone 17 Air isn't a directly replacement for the iPhone 17 Plus, so it's not just an iPhone 17 that's thin. It's going to have a single-lens 48-megapixel camera rather than a dual-lens or even triple-lens setup, and there's a new display size.

It's supposed to have a 6.6-inch display, so larger than the iPhone 17 and 17 Pro, but smaller than the 17 Pro Max. It will be slim, but just how slim is unclear. Rumors suggest that it could be around 2mm thinner than the iPhone 16 Pro, which measures in at 8.25mm thick, so between 6 and 6.25mm is likely. That would make the iPhone 17 Air the thinnest iPhone to date, slimmer even than the 6.9mm iPhone 6 that holds the title right now.

Because the new iPhone is so thin, it can only house a single-lens rear camera, and there's only going to be one speaker at the top rather than one at the top and one at the bottom. It's possible there will be a narrower pill-shaped cutout for the front-facing camera, resulting in a narrower Dynamic Island, but whether that'll actually happen remains to be seen.

This year, all iPhone 17 models are expected to get ProMotion display technology with up to 120Hz refresh rates, so that will no longer be a feature limited to the Pro models.

The iPhone 17 Air could get a titanium-aluminum frame, which would keep it lightweight, and it will have the same next-generation chip Apple plans to use in the iPhone 17 rather than the higher-end chip Apple will use for the Pro models.

Apple plans to use its Apple-designed modem in the iPhone 17 Air to test it out. The new 5G chip will be launched in the iPhone SE, low-cost iPad, and iPhone 17 Air this year, and Apple is already working on improvements that will make it feasible to use across the iPhone lineup.

The 5G chip won't support mmWave 5G, but it does have sub-6GHz 5G, which is more commonly used in suburban and rural areas in the U.S. and in other countries.

With the iPhone 17 Air, Apple is focusing on design and form factor as the device's selling points rather than its internals, and we are expecting a price tag somewhere between the iPhone 17 and 17 Pro. It's likely to be more expensive than the iPhone 16, which is priced starting at $799, but less expensive than the 16 Pro, which starts at $999.

Apple still plans to offer a plain old iPhone 17, and it could have a larger 6.3-inch display, up from 6.1 inches. It's expected to be Apple's lowest-cost flagship device, but rumors suggest we can count on a dual-lens camera setup with a 48-megapixel Main camera, a 24-megapixel front-facing camera, and support for ProMotion.

The iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will be Apple's high-end devices per usual, but this year there could be some notable design changes. Rumors suggest Apple is planning to do away with the titanium frame in favor of an aluminum frame, and there could be a half-glass half-aluminum rear casing.

There have also been rumors about a new camera bump that's made from aluminum rather than glass. Some rumors say it will have an ""elongated oval shape"" and a horizontal layout, but it's not quite clear just what the camera setup is going to look like at this point.

The iPhone 17 Pro models could get 12GB RAM, with other models set to have 8GB RAM.

Apple is expected to upgrade the camera in the Pro models, introducing a 48-megapixel Telephoto lens. With that upgrade, the iPhone 17 Pro models will have a 48-megapixel Wide lens, a 48-megapixel Ultra Wide lens, and a 48-megapixel Telephoto lens.

At least one iPhone 17 model is expected to have a mechanical aperture that will let users adjust the size of the aperture, which changes the amount of light that reaches the lens. A variable aperture will let images be captured with a shallower depth-of-field, and it's likely that this would be an iPhone 17 Pro feature.

It seems like we've been hearing about a new iPhone SE for years now, and the next-generation version of Apple's low-cost iPhone will finally launch in 2025.

Rumors suggest that the iPhone SE 4 will be modeled after the iPhone 14, with a 6.06-inch display, Face ID, and a notch. At that size, the iPhone SE 4 will be significantly larger than the current iPhone SE. It will use OLED display technology, which also means Apple will finally finish phasing out LCD displays from the iPhone lineup.

The device will have a single-lens 48-megapixel rear camera and a USB-C port. There is a possibility it will have the same multi-function Action Button that's available with the iPhone 16 models.

The iPhone SE will get a faster A-series chip, likely the A18, which will support Apple Intelligence. Adding Apple Intelligence support also means that it will need a minimum of 8GB RAM.

With the launch of the iPhone SE, Apple will introduce the custom modem chip that it has been designing in-house for the last several years. The Apple 5G chip won't support mmWave 5G, but it will support sub-6GHz. Apple is debuting the modem chip in the iPhone SE to make sure that it works well before it is expanded to additional devices such as the flagship iPhones.

Apple is developing a home accessory that's meant to serve as a central hub or ""Command Center"" for smart home management. While the Apple TV and HomePod are already home hubs and there are multiple options for controlling a HomeKit setup, Apple is creating a more accessible all-in-one home management product that will make control easier.

The hub's display will support touch input for opening apps and controlling connected devices, and while it's not getting a dedicated App Store, it will have Apple apps like Notes, Calendar, Home, Apple Music, Apple News, Photos, Safari, Reminders, and more installed.

Apple is designing a dock that can house the hub, but it will also be able to be mounted on the wall. Speakers will be built in, and there will be a camera for FaceTime calls. Built-in sensors will be able to determine how close a person is to the hub, and information displayed on the screen can shift based on that proximity. It may also support person detection that would allow it to be used in smart home automations for doing things like turning on the lights when someone enters a room.

With an A18 chip, the device will support Apple Intelligence, and speaking to Siri will be a main part of communication with the hub. Apple envisions multiple devices being in different rooms of the house, and the device will serve as a room-to-room intercom and it will be able to play music.

Competing products from companies like Amazon have hub accessories priced at around $90, so Apple may be aiming to meet that price point with its own hub. The smart home hub could be released as soon as early 2025, though there has been some disagreement on its launch timeline so it could also come later in the year.

In 2024, Apple only updated the Series 10, but this year, there are updates for the standard Apple Watch, the Apple Watch SE, and the Apple Watch Ultra planned.

The Apple Watch gets a yearly refresh, and 2025 will be no exception. If Apple can finish the feature on time, the Apple Watch Series 11 could support blood pressure monitoring. The feature won't measure exact systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels, but will instead measure trends and alert the wearer if high blood pressure has been detected.

Apple did not refresh the Apple Watch Ultra in 2024, but a new model is expected in 2025. The Apple Watch Ultra 3 will get satellite connectivity, allowing for off-grid texting and communication when Wi-Fi and cellular connections are unavailable. Satellite connectivity would be an Apple Watch Ultra exclusive, distinguishing it from Apple's lower-cost models.

Apple will refresh the Apple Watch SE in 2025, adding a new, faster processor. As a lower-cost Apple Watch option, the Apple Watch SE does not offer the same health features as the standard Apple Watch like ECG functionality, the ability to read temperature, and more, but it does have all of the standard sleep tracking and heart rate tracking features.

Apple has been focusing on Apple Watch for kids marketing, and the Apple Watch SE offers a way for parents to give their children managed devices for location tracking and communication.

New Apple Watch models often come out in September, so we are expecting to see the next Apple Watch SE debut alongside new iPhones in the fall.

The AirPods were refreshed in 2024, and in 2025, it's the AirPods Pro's turn. New AirPods Pro 3 are expected at some point in 2025, though the timing is not yet clear.

Better audio quality is expected, along with improvements to Active Noise Cancellation and better integration with the Vision Pro headset.

Apple is working on a new H3 connectivity chip that powers everything from Active Noise Cancellation to Siri, and a faster H3 chip could bring multiple improvements for ANC, music quality, spatial audio, and more.

There are rumors that Apple has been testing some AirPods health features like body temperature monitoring and heart rate monitoring, and there is a possibility that we could get those features. Temperature reading specifically has the potential to be useful because temperatures taken from the ear are more accurate than the wrist temperature measurement the Apple Watch uses, and heart rate monitoring would bring the feature to iPhone users who do not have an Apple Watch.

With the AirPods 4, Apple removed the physical pairing button and replaced it with a hidden capacitive button and a hidden LED light, so we could see those same updates made to the AirPods Pro 4.

Apple will update the HomePod mini in 2025, adding a faster S-series chip and a new Apple-designed Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip that will replace components from supplier Broadcom. Along with these internal changes, we will likely see new color options. Timing on the HomePod mini refresh is unknown.

Apple is expected to refresh the Apple TV 4K in 2025, adding a faster A-series chip and a new Apple-designed Bluetooth and Wi-Fi combo chip. The new chip will allow Apple's smart home devices to work better together and synchronize data quicker.

In early 2025, Apple plans to update the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models with M4 chip technology, which will replace the model with the current M3 chip. The M4 chip will offer speed and efficiency improvements over the M3 chip, but it will be an incremental update that won't tempt those who already own an M3 MacBook Air.

The device will have 16GB RAM minimum, and we are not expecting any design changes. The MacBook Air will be refreshed early in the year, likely in the March timeframe.

Apple plans to refresh the Mac Pro in 2025, adding a higher-end M4 chip. So far, Apple has introduced M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max chips, but the Mac Pro will likely launch with an M4 Ultra option, which offers double the performance of the M4 Max.

We're expecting the Mac Pro to be refreshed late in the year, perhaps around the October or November timeframe.

As with the Mac Pro, Apple will skip the M3 chip generation for the Mac Studio, and no design changes are expected. The Mac Studio could see an update in mid to late 2025.

An updated MacBook Pro with an M5 chip could launch in 2025, bringing a small performance boost. No new display technologies such as OLED are expected until 2026 or 2027. The machine could have a new camera that's more compact, potentially allowing Apple to cut down on the size of the notch.

Rumors about what's next for the Vision Pro have been all over the place, but Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes Apple will come out with a next-generation version of the Vision Pro in 2025. Kuo is not expecting major design changes, but the headset will get an M5 chip, up from the current M2 chip.

It is possible that Apple won't bring Apple Intelligence to its most affordable iPad, and if that's the case, a less powerful chip could be included.

Along with an updated chip, the low-cost iPad will be one of the first devices to feature the 5G modem chip that Apple designed in-house. The low-cost iPad is expected to see a refresh early in the year.

Apple will update the iPad Air with a new M-series chip. The current model has the M2, so Apple is expected to upgrade it to the M3. That's a generation behind the M4 chip in the iPad Pro, which will give the iPad Pro an edge over the lower-cost iPad Air.

Alongside the iPad Air, Apple could introduce an updated Magic Keyboard with a function row of keys.

Apple is working on a new version of the AirTag that has a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip for improved range. With the new chip, users will be able to locate their AirTags from further away.

June will see the introduction of iOS 19, iPadOS 19, macOS 16, tvOS 19, watchOS 12, and visionOS 3, and we're counting on new Apple Intelligence features.

iOS 18.4 is likely coming out in April, and then with iOS 19 in June, Apple will announce even more Siri and Apple Intelligence features.

With so many changes planned for the iPhone lineup, 2025 isn't going to be a boring year for Apple, especially with new Apple Intelligence features slated to be announced in iOS 19.

"How Wesley gets work done at AppleInsider: iPad Pro, Vision Pro, & a Mac on a bookshelf","Wesley is back to being a full-time iPad Pro user, but there's a splash of Apple Vision Pro and a mountain of other tech involved in the day-to-day. Here's how he gets work done at AppleInsider.

If there's one thing I like writing about, it's my setup and workflows. There's a lot going on here, and unless you're new here, you might already know I'm all in on iPad and a little obsessed with Apple Vision Pro.

My setup and workflows don't reflect the rest of my colleagues, and that's fine. I'm happy that I get to figure out new and interesting ways to tackle problems that might otherwise be solved by simply using a Mac.

It's been a bit of a rollercoaster of tech these past few years, but regardless of my experiments, I always landed back at the iPad. Even as Apple Vision Pro attempts to prove its place in the lineup, the iPad has solidified as the future of computing, at least for me.

If you're keeping score, that's two years of iPad followed by a year of Mac, and now another two years of iPad. Apple Vision Pro swung in but couldn't make a significant mark on my workflows, especially after the introduction of Apple Intelligence.

Today, I've got several pieces of technology in my lineup, and each serves a specific purpose in my work and life. So, let's discuss each.

M4 iPad Pro with Nano Texture and an iPad mini 7

The king of my setup is the M4 iPad Pro (check best prices), Apple's best take on the naked robotic core to date. Meaning, it can take on any form it needs based on what it is paired with.

The iPad Pro is an excellent tablet with its thin and lightweight design, large 13-inch display, and Apple Pencil Pro. I don't often use the iPad Pro as just a tablet, but being able to pull it close and manipulate work with a finger or stylus is excellent.

Attach the Magic Keyboard (on sale at Amazon), and the iPad Pro becomes a laptop. That's when I get to take the iPad with me to the living room, my favorite brewery, a hotel room, or a picnic table and get work done with a trackpad and keyboard.

Slap the iPad into one of many magnetic stands, and the iPad can become a floating display. I can pair it with a gamepad and use it as a little TV, or have it by my bedside for reading or watching media.

Set iPad Pro into a magnetic stand and connect a Thunderbolt cable, and it becomes a desktop computer with a second 27-inch 5K monitor. I use a StarTech Thunderbolt 4 dock to connect the iPad Pro to a Studio Display, Magic Trackpad, ASUS TUF capture card, Keychron Q3 Pro SE mechanical keyboard, and a Samsung 1TB SSD.

The capture card was purchased as part of a greater experiment that didn't quite make it all the way to fruition. I wanted to see how streaming would work with iPad Pro as the managing computer, and it worked for the most part, but capturing audio, video, and microphone proved challenging, but possible with some workarounds. Perhaps I'll write about it one day.

For now, it still works as an excellent way to get a game console like Nintendo Switch or PlayStation 5 onto the Studio Display through the attached iPad. I can use the setup to capture incoming video and audio too, which would be great if I ever wanted to get into making videos of gameplay.

The great thing about having a single cable connect to my entire desk setup was being able to easily swap the iPad Pro for the 14-inch MacBook Pro and record the AppleInsider Podcast. I traded that MacBook in for an M4 Mac mini, which I'll get into later.

I love working from the iPad Pro despite Apple's continued insistence on kneecapping the operating system and software with arbitrary limits. Every year, Apple manages to address one or two pro user complaints, but it's not guaranteed.

Since the 13-inch iPad Pro represents my workplace, I have taken to using a second iPad that's smaller, but still can do most of what I need. That tablet is the iPad mini 7, Apple's best iPad-as-a-tablet in its lineup thanks to its power and form factor.

The iPad mini is my personal computer that goes with me everywhere. Its display is bigger and more square than the iPhone, so it's perfect for viewing media, reading text, or playing games.

When I'm working, the iPad mini is with me at the desk, but it is often turned off. When I need a second display for whatever reason, that's when the iPad mini is pulled in.

My iPhone acts as a data viewer, like showing battery levels, rain, or now playing music on the office HomePods thanks to StandBy, so no, the iPad mini isn't doing that either.

I'll admit, the iPad mini is a bit redundant at the desk, but I'm happy it's there when I need it. Plus, if I want to take a video I'm watching with me or something similar, I can grab it from its stand and walk away.

That's four active displays at my desk in front of my eyes at any time. Honestly, that style of setup is a remnant of the pre-Apple Vision Pro that could change in the future.

Having two iPads becomes much more useful when I'm away from the desk. Since I don't have the Studio Display with me, I like having my primary work on the 13-inch iPad Pro and have the iPad mini as a secondary display.

A desk-filled office

The desk setup is meant to be somewhat modular. I work from an L-shaped desk by Uplift that has proven to be a favorite. I turn to the right side of the desk to podcast, that way I'm facing a wall of foam.

Behind me is a standing desk by Flexispot. I also use the C7 chair.

That second desk is my photography station. I place different mats and backdrops to provide different styles for my product photography that you've undoubtedly seen across AppleInsider. You'll usually notice it's mine because of my tendency to use darker color palettes and moody lighting.

A third table, that I think is technically also a desk, is used to hold extra equipment, upcoming review products, and my printer. Below the desk is a bunch of storage containers filled with cables, HomeKit items, keyboard parts, and more. The rolling cart covered with stickers is more of the same.

A bookshelf in the opposite corner of my office contains various Apple and video game memorabilia. But most importantly, it's where my Mac mini lives.

M4 Mac mini

Funny enough, there's not much to say about the M4 Mac mini (on sale now). It exists solely to record podcasts without hassle.

The job was previously held by my 14-inch MacBook Pro, but I figured that display was being wasted in clamshell mode on a bookshelf.

When I need to access the Mac mini, I wake it using a Magic Mouse that's on the far right side of my desk. My Apple Watch wakes it, provided it hasn't been too long since its last wake.

Then, if I need to do anything with the Mac mini, I put on the Apple Vision Pro and interface from there. It's basically just for podcasts and testing functions for articles.

A portable monitor sits at the base of the bookshelf behind closed doors so the Mac mini has some kind of display if needed. Although, even if it is awake, I almost never look at it.

I'm happy to have the M4 Mac mini. It'll serve as a good access point to macOS, and at least it can run a Gamecube emulator if I want it to.

One thing I am experimenting with and will revisit in 2025 is the Mac mini and making it portable. It makes for a neat way to access the Mac through a Virtual Display without a need for an outlet.

Apple Vision Pro

I've been dancing around Apple Vision Pro so far because it sits at an interesting spot in my workflow. It constantly competes for my favorite piece of technology versus the iPad Pro, but falls just short.

When Apple Vision Pro was released in February, it quickly became my primary computer because it could do everything my M1 iPad Pro could. However, the M4 iPad Pro stole the spotlight after that through review needs, then Apple Intelligence sealed the deal.

See, Apple Intelligence still isn't available on Apple Vision Pro, and I need it for my workflow. I dumped Grammarly after Apple's Proofread function in Writing Tools got good enough and haven't looked back.

If I really want to, I could open Drafts in the Mac mini Virtual Display and run Proofread, but it's just not the same. The bit of friction there has brought me back to my favorite setup with iPad Pro.

When I need to get something done as rapidly as possible, I still rely on the iPad for that. However, Apple Vision Pro is still my go-to device for long-form content. This story was written mostly in Apple Vision Pro.

I'm one of the few that can claim zero discomfort from using Apple Vision Pro and the Solo Knit Band. If more of my workflow could be accomplished via native apps in visionOS, I'd be there more often.

Until then, Apple Vision Pro has taken a back seat to iPad Pro. I use it a few times a week, sometimes for hours at a time, but it certainly isn't the primary machine.

One use you can count on is me wearing it while recording the AppleInsider Podcast. It lets me view my Mac display, Safari, and show notes without having a large piece of glass in front of my face, thus causing echoes.

I think Apple has something special with Apple Vision Pro, and I can't wait to see more apps and experiences on the platform. We'll see what 2025 has to offer -- perhaps I'll be writing about it overtaking the iPad before year's end.

An office in flux

I'm never happy with my spaces. I'll continuously seek ways to tweak and optimize workflows as new products emerge and technologies improve.

I believed and hoped Apple Vision Pro would have a larger impact on my office. In fact, I thought I might even clear off the desk to have a kind of empty platform for virtual objects and windows.

Don't get me wrong, I'm still tempted to do that if and when the time comes, but Apple Vision Pro still needs to do everything without compromise, and that includes Apple Intelligence. I'm in a constant battle between my love of the iPad Pro and Apple Vision Pro, so for now, my office is a place that supports both.

This home is a rental, and if you haven't heard before, I'll tell you here -- I'm getting married in October 2025. We plan to buy a home in 2026 if everything lines up, so that prospect sits constantly on the edge of my thoughts.

I know my time in this space is limited, so I'm likely not to change too much over 2025. My setup has come a long way since my little corner desk in a Virginia Beach apartment.

Perhaps my new home and new office will be built around the increased prominence of spatial computing. Only time will tell.

Travel

Part of what I love about my job is its portability. So, I wanted to talk a little about how I get work done outside of the office.

I've got a bit of a weekly ritual, provided the weather holds. I like to hop on my e-bike and ride into town on Fridays so I can get work done somewhere other than my office.

My go-to bag for these outings is the Nomatic Navigator 10L. It carries my iPad Pro in the Magic Keyboard, a bike lock, iPad mini, game controller, and a battery pack with a kickstand.

When I'm set up at a local place, it's usually just the iPad Pro, but I do like using the battery pack to hold the iPhone up so I can view StandBy. The iPad mini is more for playing games on the go than anything.

More serious outings require bigger bags. If I'm going to carry what's basically my entire office, I go for the AirPorter Backpack by Waterfield, which is a perfect companion for the Shield Case.

This big bag holds my iPads, Apple Vision Pro, Mac mini, batteries, controllers, chargers, and still leaves space after. It's an excellent option for my annual out-of-state trip.

It still scares me a bit carrying my Apple Vision Pro out of my home, not to mention using it in public. But I do have a cool solution for that when the Shield Case and Air Porter Backpack are overkill.

The Backpack for Apple Vision Pro by Waterfield is a great in-between. So far, I find it's best when I'm visiting a local friend and want to show them the headset.

The coolest part of the Backpack are these two zipper bags included with it. They've become my travel companions regardless of what bag I'm carrying since they hold my cables and folding 3-in-1 iPhone charger.

iPhone 16 Pro Max and the rest

I've mentioned my iPhone 16 Pro Max throughout this write-up, but I wanted to carve out a little spot for it here. It's the core of Apple's business, but funny enough, not really a big work tool for me.

Beyond acting as a StandBy machine at my desk and abroad, my iPhone serves two specific purposes in my work. It's an amazing camera for product photography and a good video camera for recording the HomeKit Insider Podcast.

If you see a photo taken in my office, in a light booth, or otherwise in my home, chances are those photos were taken with my trusty Sony a7II. Everything outside the house, like photos for my bike reviews or the outdoor shots of Apple Vision Pro in Virginia Beach, are taken with the iPhone.

I've always loved iPhone photography, but it is incredible how powerful the camera has become. I mentioned in the iPhone 16 Pro Max review how important I believed Camera Control and reversible Photographic Styles were for a reason.

While iPad mini 7 (check sale prices) is my go-to personal computer for entertainment or reading while I'm at home, the iPhone is my computer everywhere else. And of course, if I want to write in Apple Journal, I still have to do so from the iPhone only.

The iPhone goes well beyond just entertainment too. It's how I log my calories, view health data, manage my home with Reminders, communicate with my friends and family, and so much more.

Apple Watch Series 10 is an extension of the iPhone, acting as a window into my activity and life. AirPods Pro 2 are always on my person, in my pocket or looped through my belt, and let me hide from the noise or enhance what I hear.

The iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch I keep with me all day every day ended up at the end of this list because it's honestly difficult to remember they are there. I didn't even get into Apple Home, HomePods, Apple TV, and the other tech that surrounds me and is part of my work.

For better or worse, technology surrounds us. It's why I'm in this profession, so I can explain it, criticize it, and be a part of the discussion about these life-changing products.",AppleInsider,https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/12/30/how-we-work-wes-hilliards-apple-vision-pro-ipad-pro-centric-workflows,2024-12-30,
iPhone 17 'Slim' Rumors: The Thinnest iPhone Yet Could Arrive Next Year,"Expertise Apple | Samsung | Google | Smartphones | Smartwatches | Wearables | Fitness trackers

With the iPhone 17, Apple may once again shake up its smartphone lineup by introducing an entirely new style of iPhone.

Apple may release a significantly thinner model called the iPhone 17 Slim, according to analysts and reports from tech business news outlets The Information and Bloomberg. If true, the shift would be the latest design change Apple has made to its smartphone family in the last four years, coming after it introduced the now-extinct ""Mini"" and ""Plus""-sized iPhones in previous years. Apple also may not be alone; Samsung is rumored to be developing a thinner version of the Galaxy S25 next year, too, according to ETNews.

With the rumored iPhone 17 Slim, Apple appears to be focusing on aesthetics above all else, reports and rumors indicate. As the name implies, the iPhone 17's thinness is expected to be its main draw, unlike the Pro models that rely more heavily on camera quality and processing power to distinguish themselves from Apple's standard iPhones. Apple took a similar approach with the 2024 iPad Pro, which the company flaunts as being its thinnest product ever.

The iPhone Plus variants, which Apple launched with the iPhone 14 lineup as a larger-sized base model option, may be phased out in favor of this new iPhone 17 Slim in 2025, says TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. This suggests Apple is looking for new ways to get generate hype around its non-Pro iPhones, coming after its premium Pro options have been outshining sales of the regular iPhone 15 and 15 Plus, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners.

""The once flagship, now base iPhone 15, is no longer the leading-edge choice, as the Pro and Pro Max models take that role,"" wrote CIRP's Michael Levin and Josh Lowitz in a report shared with CNET in May, before the iPhone 16 launch.

Apple did not respond to a request for comment regarding reports about the iPhone 17 Slim when this story was originally published.

With the absence of a foldable phone, the iPhone 17 Slim could be a clever way for Apple to get customers excited about the iPhone's design again. Here's what we know about it so far.

If Apple does release a slimmer new iPhone, it will likely do so in 2025 as part of the iPhone 17 lineup, say reports from Haitong International Securities analyst Jeff Pu and co-founder and CEO of Display Supply Chain Consultants Ross Young (as reported by 9to5Mac). Kuo, Bloomberg and The Information have reported similar findings. Bloomberg predicts this model could essentially be the iPhone version of the original MacBook Air.

Even though Apple may cut the iPhone Plus from its lineup, don't expect the iPhone 17 Slim to be a direct replacement, says Kuo. Instead, it's meant to be a new variant entirely rather than another flavor of the base iPhone. The Information reports that it could even be more expensive than the $1,200 iPhone Pro Max, while The Wall Street Journal indicates it may be cheaper than the Pro models.

The iPhone 17 Slim may have a 6.6-inch screen, which would make it slightly smaller than the iPhone Plus and iPhone Pro Max, according to the analysts Pu and Kuo. But it will reportedly have Apple's ProMotion technology for boosting the refresh rate up to 120Hz, which makes scrolling smoother, MacRumors reports, citing Pu. Korean tech news site The Elec also reported that the display technology used for the entire iPhone 17 series, which would presumably include the base model and the rumored Slim, will be capable of supporting higher refresh rates like the current Pro devices.

Both analysts also foresee changes to the iPhone 17 Slim's materials too, with Pu saying the iPhone 17 Slim (along with the base and Pro model) will be made of a ""more complex"" aluminum material and Kuo reporting the iPhone 17 Slim will have a ""titanium-aluminum alloy metal frame."" Apple introduced a new polished aluminum finish for the Apple Watch Series 10, so it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to see a fresh type of aluminum for a new style of iPhone.

The cutout for the Dynamic Island is expected to remain the same size, say both analysts.

Apple might make a bold choice with the iPhone 17 Slim's camera. The company's superslim iPhone may only have one main wide camera, reports Kuo, meaning it would lack the ultrawide and telephoto lenses that have been staples within Apple's premium iPhone lineup for years.

The only device in Apple's current crop of iPhones to come with one rear camera is the $429 iPhone SE. If true, the move would further underscore that Apple is truly focusing on design above all else with the iPhone 17 Slim, hoping to attract users that want an iPhone that feels new and different rather than one with a souped-up camera.

The choice to include just one rear camera would also likely help Apple maintain a trim build without raising the price too high. After all, camera modules, with their sensors and lens elements, can take up quite a bit of space.

All iPhone 17 models, including the Slim, will get an upgraded 24-megapixel selfie camera, Pu reports.

The iPhone 17 Slim will likely get other upgrades you'd expect with a new phone, such as a new version of Apple's mobile processor. Pu's report suggests Apple could put an A18 or A19-branded chip in the iPhone 17 Slim, which would reportedly match the chip inside the regular iPhone 17.

Other internal components for the iPhone 17 Slim could include 8GB of RAM and an Apple-developed 5G modem, which has been the subject of speculation ever since Apple acquired the majority of Intel's smartphone modem business in 2019.

What I'm most curious about, however, is the iPhone 17 Slim's battery. Sleeker designs mean less space for internal components, so I'm hoping that battery life isn't the consequence of a significantly thinner design.

However, Apple may not have room for a physical SIM slot, according to The Information. That likely won't impact US buyers since Apple removed the SIM tray starting with the iPhone 14 lineup, but it could be critical for other markets like China.

Either way, it's all speculation until Apple announces the iPhone 17 Slim -- if it does at all.

But if the reports turn out to be true, the iPhone 17 Slim could signal a turning point for the iPhone, indicating that camera upgrades may no longer be the most exciting or significant annual change.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/iphone-17-slim-rumors-the-thinnest-iphone-yet-could-arrive-next-year/,2024-12-30,
How we Work: Wes Hilliard's Apple Vision Pro & iPad Pro-centric workflows,"Wesley is back to being a full-time iPad Pro user, but there's a splash of Apple Vision Pro and a mountain of other tech involved in the day-to-day. Here's how he gets work done at AppleInsider.

The coolest part of the Backpack are these two zipper bags included with it. They've become my travel companions regardless of what bag I'm carrying since they hold my cables and folding 3-in-1 iPhone charger.

iPhone 16 Pro Max and the rest

I've mentioned my iPhone 16 Pro Max throughout this write-up, but I wanted to carve out a little spot for it here. It's the core of Apple's business, but funny enough, not really a big work tool for me.

Beyond acting as a StandBy machine at my desk and abroad, my iPhone serves two specific purposes in my work. It's an amazing camera for product photography and a good video camera for recording the HomeKit Insider Podcast.

If you see a photo taken in my office, in a light booth, or otherwise in my home, chances are those photos were taken with my trusty Sony a7II. Everything outside the house, like photos for my bike reviews or the outdoor shots of Apple Vision Pro in Virginia Beach, are taken with the iPhone.

I've always loved iPhone photography, but it is incredible how powerful the camera has become. I mentioned in the iPhone 16 Pro Max review how important I believed Camera Control and reversible Photographic Styles were for a reason.

While iPad mini 7 (check sale prices) is my go-to personal computer for entertainment or reading while I'm at home, the iPhone is my computer everywhere else. And of course, if I want to write in Apple Journal, I still have to do so from the iPhone only.

The iPhone goes well beyond just entertainment too. It's how I log my calories, view health data, manage my home with Reminders, communicate with my friends and family, and so much more.

Apple Watch Series 10 is an extension of the iPhone, acting as a window into my activity and life. AirPods Pro 2 are always on my person, in my pocket or looped through my belt, and let me hide from the noise or enhance what I hear.

The iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch I keep with me all day every day ended up at the end of this list because it's honestly difficult to remember they are there. I didn't even get into Apple Home, HomePods, Apple TV, and the other tech that surrounds me and is part of my work.

For better or worse, technology surrounds us. It's why I'm in this profession, so I can explain it, criticize it, and be a part of the discussion about these life-changing products.

iPhone SE 4 für Anfang 2025 erwartet - mit dieser Ausstattung,"Bitte beachte: Die hier aufgeführten Informationen zum iPhone SE der vierten Generation beruhen ausschließlich auf Gerüchten und Leaks. Darüber hinaus spekulieren wir zu möglichen Neuerungen bei den Specs, ausgehend von den aktuellen Modellen. Entsprechend solltest Du die Informationen mit Vorsicht behandeln.

* Das Design könnte sich an den iPhone-Flaggschiffen orientieren - samt Notch mit Face ID, USB-C-Anschluss und Aktionstaste.

* Die Gerüchteküche spricht auch von einem OLED-Display mit 6,1 Zoll und einer 48-Megapixel-Hauptkamera.

* Das neue SE-Modell soll zudem Apples KI-Plattform Apple Intelligence unterstützen.

Vermutlich dauert es nicht mehr lange, ehe wir eine neue Special Edition zu sehen bekommen. Mit der Massenproduktion des iPhone SE 4 soll im Dezember 2024 begonnen werden, berichtet MacRumors. Das macht einen Release Anfang 2025 wahrscheinlich.

"" iPhone SE (2022) im Vodafone-Shop bestellen ""

Inzwischen verdichten sich die Gerüchte, dass Apple das neue Gerät im März veröffentlichen könnte. Dazu passt, dass das Unternehmen den Vorgänger ebenfalls in diesem Monat gelauncht hat: Das iPhone SE der dritten Generation wurde am 8. März 2022 vorgestellt. Der Markstart erfolgte dann am 18. März.

Zur Erinnerung: Für das iPhone SE (2022) verlangte Apple zum Release knapp 520 Euro in der kleinsten Speicherausführung (64 Gigabyte). Für die Version mit 128 Gigabyte lag der Preis bei etwa 570 Euro.

Sollte Apple mit dem iPhone SE 4 ein neues Design für die Reihe einführen, dürfte sich das auch im Preis widerspiegeln. Unsere Vermutung daher: Bleibt Apple beim bisherigen Design, dürfte der Preis kaum steigen. Setzt Apple hingegen auf das Design des iPhone 14, dürfte es eine größere Preiserhöhung geben.

Der Einstiegspreis soll aktuellen Mutmaßungen zufolge auf 499 Dollar steigen, berichtet MacRumors. Damit wäre es das einzige iPhone auf dem Markt, das mit Face ID für unter 500 Dollar zu haben ist. Die nächstgrößere Speichervariante soll demnach 549 Dollar kosten.

Sollte diese Preispolitik auch für Europa gelten, bedeutet eine Steigerung des Einführungspreises um 10 Prozent, dass Du für die Ausführung mit 64 Gigabyte Speicherplatz knapp 570 Euro bezahlen müsstest. Der Preis für 128 Gigabyte läge wahrscheinlich bei knapp 630 Euro. Es ist gut möglich, dass Apple diese Version als kleinste Speicherausführung anbietet.

Wenn Dir der mutmaßliche Einstiegspreis zu hoch ist, könnte sich ein wenig Wartezeit lohnen. Einem Report zufolge könnte der Wert des neuen SE-iPhones schnell sinken - und damit auch der Preis, berichtet MacRumors. Vermutlich wird der Wertverlust nicht so stark sein wie beim iPhone SE (2022), dessen Wiederverkaufswert nach nur einem Monat um 42 Prozent sank.

Dennoch rechnen Expert:innen auch bei der vierten Auflage damit, dass der Wert schneller verfällt als bei High-End-Modellen wie dem iPhone 16 Pro Max.

"" Das iPhone 16 Pro Max im Vodafone-Shop ""

Das iPhone SE (2022) erinnert immer noch an das iPhone 6, das bereits 2014 erschienen ist. Gerüchten zufolge wird sich Apple für das iPhone SE 4 nun am Design des iPhone 14 orientieren. Demnach soll das neue günstige iPhone ein größeres Display mit OLED-Technologie erhalten. Die Ränder um den Bildschirm fallen zudem auch deutlich schmaler aus als beim aktuellen iPhone SE.

iPhone 14 in 2024 noch lohnenswert? Auf jeden Fall!

Das iPhone SE 4 könnte außerdem sechs Gramm leichter sein als das iPhone 14 und 165 Gramm auf die Waage bringen, so MacRumors. Im Gegensatz zum iPhone 14 soll die Special Edition allerdings nur eine rückseitige Kameralinse erhalten. So erklärt sich auch das geringere Gewicht.

Dazu müsste Apple eine neue Rückseite gestalten, wobei ebenfalls Aluminium und Glas zum Einsatz kommen könnten. Gerüchten zufolge soll das günstige iPhone sogar die gleiche Rückseite erhalten wie das iPhone 16, berichtet MacRumors.

Das würde unter anderem einen Abschied von den breiten Displayrändern bedeuten - einem wichtigen Merkmal des iPhone SE (2022). Vor allem die ""Stirn"" und das ""Kinn"" des Smartphones wirken nicht mehr zeitgemäß, ebenso wie das kleine 4,7-Zoll-Display.

Darüber hinaus soll der vom Vorgänger bekannte Homebutton wegfallen. Aktuellen CAD-Renderings zufolge misst das iPhone SE 4 insgesamt 147,7 x 71,5 x 7,7 Millimeter - und fällt damit deutlich größer aus als der Vorgänger (138,4 x 67,3 x 7,3 Millimeter).

Aber: Apple plant für das iPhone SE 4 wohl nicht, auf die vom iPhone 14 Pro bekannte Dynamic Island zu setzen. Das interaktive Feature zeigt zum Beispiel Benachrichtigungen an. Stattdessen soll das neue günstige iPhone eine klassische Notch bieten, in der auch Face-ID-Sensoren für die biometrische Entsperrung untergebracht sind.

Das iPhone 14 hat einen Bildschirm mit 6,1 Zoll Diagonale - in diesem Rahmen soll sich auch die neue Special Edition bewegen, wie PhoneArena berichtet. Das Display soll zudem mit OLED- statt LC-Technologie aufwarten, wie AppleInsider an anderer Stelle berichtet.

iPhone 14 Pro im Test: Das Kleine der Großen

Wahrscheinlich wird auch das neue iPhone SE wieder ein True-Tone-Display bieten. Dieses Apple-Feature ermöglicht eine Anpassung der Displaybeleuchtung an das Umgebungslicht. Dass das Gerät eine Bildwiederholfrequenz höher als 60 Hertz unterstützt, scheint hingegen eher unwahrscheinlich.

Zum Vergleich: Aktuelle Top-Smartphones wie das Galaxy S24 bieten eine Bildwiederholfrequenz von 120 Hertz. Beim iPhone 16 setzt Apple weiterhin auf 60 Hertz. Nur die Pro-Modelle aus dem Line-up des iPhone 16 unterstützen 120 Hertz.

Zulieferer BOE soll die Panels für das neue günstige iPhone liefern. Ein Vorteil des ""alten"" Designs ist dabei, dass die Displayhersteller auf Vorlagen älterer iPhone-Modelle zurückgreifen können. Somit fallen einige Schritte im Produktionsprozess weg, die bei neuen Bildschirmen erforderlich sind.

Apple habe sich für die Displayproduktion zudem an LG gewandt (via The Elec). Allerdings komme das Unternehmen wohl nur als Back-up zum Einsatz. Aufgrund von Produktionsausfällen im Hause BOE will Apple wohl auf Nummer sicher gehen, um eine durchgehende Verfügbarkeit des iPhone SE 4 sicherstellen zu können.

Obwohl das iPhone SE (2022) nur eine einfache Kamera hat, macht es erstaunlich gute Fotos. Google ist hingegen mit dem Pixel 6a auf eine Dualkamera umgestiegen. Ähnliches wünschen sich sicherlich viele Apple-Fans von einem Mittelklasse-iPhone.

"" Das Google Pixel 8a gibt's hier im Vodafone-Shop ""

Die Chancen auf eine Mehrfachkamera im neuen iPhone SE stehen allerdings schlecht: Angeblich soll das iPhone SE der vierten Generation nur über eine einzelne Kamera auf der Rückseite verfügen - genauso wie das Vorgängermodell.

Die Auflösung könnte aber wie beim iPhone 16 bei 48 Megapixeln liegen, was eine Verbesserung bedeuten würde. Auch die Frontkamera soll ein Upgrade bekommen - von 7 auf 12 Megapixel.

Die Kameras des kommenden SE-Modells sollen Gerüchten zufolge auch KI-Funktionen mitbringen. Die Frage ist allerdings, welche KI-Features Apple seinem Budget-Gerät spendieren könnte.

Apple soll für das iPhone SE 4 nicht nur Designelemente des iPhone 16 übernehmen; angeblich steckt im günstigen iPhone auch der gleiche Chip, berichtet MacRumors. Sollte dieses Gerücht stimmen, dürfen wir uns auf den Apple A18 freuen - und auf einen 8 Gigabyte großen Arbeitsspeicher.

Im iPhone SE 4 steckt mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit also ein deutlich schnellerer Chip als im Vorgänger. Wie groß das Leistungsupgrade wirklich ausfällt, werden allerdings Tests nach dem Release zeigen müssen.

Mitte 2024 hat Apple seine eigene Plattform für künstliche Intelligenz vorgestellt - genannt Apple Intelligence. Die KI umfasst mehrere Funktionen und kann zum Beispiel Bilder erzeugen und das Lesen sowie Schreiben von Nachrichten erleichtern. Die ersten Features wurden mit iOS 18.1 und iOS 18.2 ausgerollt - aber nur außerhalb der EU. Hierzulande sollen sie im April 2025 launchen.

iOS 18.1 und iOS 18.1.1: Release und Neuerungen im Überblick

Bislang wird Apple Intelligence nur vom iPhone 15 Pro (Max) und den iPhone-16-Modellen unterstützt, da Apple mindestens den A17-Prozessor voraussetzt.

Bloomberg-Reporter Mark Gurman prognostiziert in seinem ""Power On""-Newsletter aber, dass das kommende SE-Modell ebenfalls Apple Intelligence bietet. Das iPhone SE 4 könnte daher leistungsstärker sein als das iPhone 15 und das iPhone 15 Plus, die die KI-Plattform nicht unterstützen.

Offenbar ist das Design nicht der einzige Bereich, in dem Apple das iPhone SE 4 nach dem Vorbild iPhone 14 gestaltet. Diese Taktik soll auch den Akku mit einschließen.

Genau genommen könnte Apple sogar exakt den gleichen Akku verbauen wie im iPhone 14, berichtet MacRumors. Demnach seien Prototypen des neuen günstigen iPhones gesichtet worden, deren Akku die Modellnummer ""A2863"" trage. Diese Nummer habe Apple bereits in der Vergangenheit benutzt.

iPhone 16: So fallen Akkukapazität und -laufzeit aus

Zur Erinnerung: Der Akku im iPhone SE von 2022 hat verschiedenen Tests zufolge eine Kapazität von etwas über 2.000 Milliamperestunden. Die Kapazität des Akkus ""A2863"" liege MacRumors zufolge bei rund 3.280 Milliamperestunden. Entsprechend dürfte Dir das iPhone SE 4 eine längere Akkulaufzeit bieten als sein Vorgänger.

Im September 2024 präsentierte Apple das iPhone 16 Pro und das iPhone 16 Pro Max. Die Modelle haben seitlich einen Button, den Du mit verschiedenen Funktionen belegen kannst: die Actiontaste. Angeblich soll auch das iPhone SE 4 diesen Button bekommen, wie MacRumors berichtet.

iPhone 15 Pro: Action Button einstellen

Das iPhone SE der vierten Generation wird außerdem mit einem USB-C-Anschluss aufwarten. Denn einem EU-Beschluss zufolge müssen Smartphones ab 2024 in Europa einen USB-C-Port bieten. Deshalb sind auch die iPhone-15- und iPhone-16-Modelle mit diesem Anschluss ausgestattet. Wir haben an anderer Stelle alles zum iPhone 15 und dem USB-C-Anschluss zusammengefasst.

Im Folgenden fassen wir die möglichen Specs und Features der neuen Special Edition übersichtlich zusammen.

iPhone SE 4 Rumors: Apple's Next Cheap Phone May Pack Big Upgrades,"Expertise Apple | Samsung | Google | Smartphones | Smartwatches | Wearables | Fitness trackers

Apple's more affordable phone could make another big comeback in 2025. The $429 iPhone SE, Apple's entry-level model, is expected to get a major refresh next year, bringing it more in line with Apple's recent iPhones, according to reports from Bloomberg and other analysts.

Unlike Apple's flagship iPhone family, the iPhone SE's launch timing is somewhat irregular. The first generation SE launched in 2016, followed by the second version in 2020 and the third in 2022. Apple also hasn't mentioned whether it plans to release new iPhone SE models moving forward, as it rarely speaks about future products. With rumors suggesting the iPhone SE will inherit the iPhone 14's design, the next model could signal the end of the home button and a shift away from smaller screens.

There's plenty of room for Apple to further improve its cheaper iPhone. While my colleague Patrick Holland praised the 2022 iPhone SE for its accessible price and familiar home button, he criticized it for its lack of night mode photos and dated design. Android competitors like Samsung and Google have also improved their similarly priced budget phones in recent years. The Google Pixel 8A and Samsung Galaxy A55 5G both offer features once reserved for premium devices, like high refresh rates and multiple cameras.

It's impossible to know exactly what to expect from Apple until the company makes an announcement. Based on predictions and reports from Bloomberg, MacRumors and the plugged-in TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, along with other leaks and Apple's product launch history, here's what we'd expect from Apple's next budget iPhone.

Apple didn't respond to a request for comment regarding a future iPhone SE when this story was originally published.

There has been a lot of back-and-forth about the iPhone SE 4's launch timing in recent years. But an August report from the often-accurate Mark Gurman of Bloomberg suggests that a new iPhone SE could debut in the beginning of 2025. That suggests it may arrive in the first quarter, which would line up with Apple's previous iPhone SE release dates. The first and third generation models, for example, both launched in March.

The analyst Kuo also reported in October that mass production of the new iPhone SE would begin in December 2024, further indication that an early 2025 release may be in store for Apple's next tiny phone.

The reports come after rumors and speculation about the iPhone SE's existence have been uncertain over the last several years. In 2019, Kuo said Apple was working on an iPhone SE with a full-screen design similar to the iPhone XR, as MacRumors reported at the time. Apple has released two versions of the iPhone SE since then that retain the old iPhone 8-inspired design, which raised questions about whether the model Kuo was referring to has been canceled or postponed.

Kuo's 2023 predictions regarding the iPhone SE 4 have also been mixed. He reported last January that an iPhone SE originally planned for 2024 was canceled but followed up to say the project had been revived. He changed his prediction again in April 2023 to say that the model he previously referred to might just be an engineering prototype for an Apple in-house 5G baseband chip. His previous comments also suggested the iPhone SE 4 would include this 5G chip.

But newer reports, including one from MacRumors, indicate Apple is indeed developing a new iPhone SE that reportedly includes some dramatic upgrades.

The iPhone SE typically has the same processor as Apple's most recent flagship iPhone. For example, the 2022 iPhone SE has the same chip as the iPhone 13, which launched in September 2021. Since Apple's newest mobile chip is usually the iPhone SE's standout feature, it's hard to imagine Apple straying from that pattern.

But that's more important than ever now that Apple Intelligence, the company's suite of new AI features, is dependent on the company's latest chips. The iPhone 16 family and last year's Pro models are the only iPhones capable of running these features for now. But based on Apple's history and Bloomberg's report, which says the iPhone SE 4 will support Apple Intelligence, it looks like that could change in the coming months.

Apple Intelligence includes new AI-powered features such as the ability to rewrite, summarize and proofread text, a new version of Siri that's better at understanding words even when you fumble, the ability to erase objects in photos, and notification and message summaries, among other features. The first wave of Apple Intelligence arrived in Apple's iOS 18.1 update, while more features -- such as the ability to generate custom emoji -- will come later in iOS 18.2.

Otherwise, the next iPhone SE could have an Apple-made 5G chip, according to Kuo. Still, it's hard to know if that prediction still applies since he later revised his estimate to say this device was likely an engineering prototype to test that 5G chip. MacRumors also reports that the iPhone SE 4 will have an Apple-made 5G modem.

If the company is working on another iPhone SE, it will likely have a 6.1-inch screen similar to Apple's modern flagship phones. The current iPhone SE, by comparison, has a 4.7-inch screen with thick borders at the top and chin, much like the iPhone 8.

In particular, the iPhone SE 4 is expected to look a lot like the iPhone 14, which Apple launched in 2022. A MacRumors article reported in September 2023 that the iPhone SE 4 will have a modified version of the iPhone 14's chassis and reiterated that point again in November. Bloomberg's report also suggests the iPhone SE 4 will resemble Apple's two-year-old flagship.

It's not just the design that's expected to get an upgrade; the display will see improvements too. Multiple reports, including those from Kuo, MacRumors, Bloomberg, The Elec and Nikkei Asia, suggest the next iPhone SE will have an OLED screen instead of LCD. That's a big deal because OLED typically displays richer contrast and deeper blacks, and these types of screens are consistent across the rest of Apple's iPhone lineup.

The next iPhone SE could inherit the iPhone 14's battery as well, according to MacRumors. If the blog's previous reports about the iPhone SE 4 following in the iPhone 14's footsteps prove to be accurate, a larger battery would be necessary to power its larger screen. Apple doesn't disclose the battery capacities for its phones, but it says the iPhone 14 should get five extra hours of video playback compared to the third-generation iPhone SE. Between the new chip and bigger battery that we're expecting to find in the next iPhone SE, it sounds like Apple's next affordable iPhone could see some pretty significant gains in battery life.

Fans of Apple's Touch ID fingerprint sensor may be out of luck. MacRumors reports that the next iPhone SE will have Face ID, like other modern iPhones, instead of Apple's fingerprint sensor. That conflicts with Kuo's report from 2019, which indicated that the next iPhone SE would have a smaller notch area without Face ID and Touch ID embedded in the power button. But since Kuo's report is about five years old, that information may be outdated.

Apple's next wallet-friendly iPhone may have a few things in common with Apple's newer iPhones. Since Apple switched to USB-C starting with the iPhone 15 lineup to comply with new European rules, it seems likely that the iPhone SE 4 could ditch the Lightning connector as well. MacRumors also claims the iPhone SE 4 will have USB-C.

The more surprising note in MacRumors' story is that the iPhone SE 4 could gain the Action button, which is a new key for programming shortcuts that's currently exclusive to the iPhone 16 family, the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. If true, it would be another sign that Apple wants to make the Action button standard across the iPhone lineup, coming after it brought the Action button to the standard models this year.

MacRumors also reports that a 48-megapixel single camera could be in store for the next iPhone SE. That would signal another similarity it could share with the iPhone 15 and 16, which also have 48-megapixel main cameras. If the report is accurate, the iPhone SE will only have one rear camera, unlike Apple's more expensive phones. The regular iPhone 15 has wide and ultra-wide cameras, while the Pro versions have wide, ultra-wide and telephoto cameras.

But Apple introduced the ""Fusion"" camera on this year's regular iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, which it says enables a 2x optical quality zoom despite lacking a dedicated telephoto lens. While reports don't specify whether the iPhone SE 4 will have this camera, it wouldn't be surprising if Apple implemented it to compensate for the iPhone SE's single camera setup.

If the rumors are true, the fourth-generation iPhone SE could bring Apple's tiny, budget iPhone up to date with the rest of Apple's lineup. Depending on the price, it could end up being a solid choice for people in need of a more modern iPhone that don't care about the iPhone 16's extra flourishes, like the Camera Control button.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/iphone-se-4-rumors-apples-next-cheap-phone-may-pack-big-upgrades/,2024-12-29,
"iPhone in 2025: More AI, iPhone SE 4 and maybe the thinnest iPhone ever","For the iPhone, 2024 was all about the software, as Apple made its long-awaited -- some would say much overdue -- push into AI features on board its smartphones. And that's likely to continue into 2025, as the Apple Intelligence launch is far from over. Apple still has features it promised last summer to deliver, and then there are the new additions to Apple Intelligence currently in the works that will doubtlessly arrive next fall.

However, while software figures to be a key driver of the iPhone's fortunes in the coming year, 2025 could also bring with it some hardware surprises. We can count on the usual fall iPhone release, of course, and it seems likely an iPhone SE update will get here sooner rather than later. But there also rumblings of an entirely new iPhone that could usher in a new design in what figures to be the most substantial overhaul since 2017's iPhone X release.

In other words, it looks like another big year is ahead for the iPhone, as Apple works to keep its phone lineup vibrant some 18 years after the original iPhone's debut. Here's what the next 12 months could bring, based on rumors surrounding Apple's software and hardware efforts.

After introducing Apple Intelligence features to the iPhone in October with the iOS 18.1 update and augmenting that suite of AI tools with more capabilities through iOS 18.2, we're in a bit of a lull period for new AI-powered features. The iOS 18.3 update won't arrive until early 2025, and based on the currently available public beta, most of the changes appear to be tweaks, bug fixes and aesthetic changes. There's no indication of significant Apple Intelligence additions coming via iOS 18.3 as of this writing.

But that doesn't mean the Apple Intelligence rollout is complete. Back when it previewed its AI tools at WWDC 2024, Apple outlined a vision for a revamped Siri, where the digital assistant would be aware of your personal context and be able to take action on whatever happened to be on your iPhone screen at the time of you summoning the assistant. Though Siri has seen some updates courtesy of Apple Intelligence -- there's a new full-screen animation when the assistant is active, you can use a more conversational tone when interacting with Siri and there's now ChatGPT integration -- but that final piece of the puzzle has yet to arrive.

Mark Gurman of Bloomberg has pointed to the iOS 18.4 update -- arriving at some point between the start of 2025 and Apple's annual developer conference at the start of sumer -- as the one that will bring more features to Siri. In addition to greater contextual awareness, the Siri revamp promises a more natural-sounding assistant that will boast more in-app controls, including third-party apps.

In addition to delivering the features promised this past summer, Apple will likely bring more Apple Intelligence features to its devices in 2025, though details on what this future round of updates will deliver have yet to emerge. Apple Intelligence figures to be a big focus at the 2025 edition of Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference, which typically takes place in June. We'd expect a preview of forthcoming Apple Intelligence additions at that time alongside sneak peeks at the rest of Apple's 2025 software updates, including iOS 19. (More on that iPhone software update in a moment.)

Besides the iOS 18.4 update, the other big iPhone-related event likely to happen in the opening months of 2025 is an iPhone SE launch. After releasing the iPhone SE 2022 two years after the previous SE model, Apple skipped an update in 2024, but most Apple observers think an iPhone SE 4 will be arriving this coming spring.

When it does show up, the iPhone SE figures to look very different from the current model, which still sports the Touch ID button and chunky bezels found on 2017's iPhone 8 release. The new iPhone SE is tipped to adapt a more modern design -- think the iPhone 14 with an edge-to-edge display interrupted only by a notch at the top of the screen to house the front camera and Face ID sensors. That would mean a bigger screen for the iPhone SE with most rumors pointing to a 6.1-inch OLED panel, potentially replacing the LCD screen found on the current iPhone SE.

In fact, you could have a choice of screen sizes with the iPhone SE 4. Some rumors suggest Apple will offer a second model -- an iPhone SE Plus -- with an even larger 6.7-inch screen. If true, it would recognize that people prefer larger screens on their handsets than the current iPhone SE's 4.7-inch panel.

Apple could have another big change in store with the iPhone SE 4, assuming it sticks with its usual chipset plans for the rumored phone. Previous iPhone SE models have used the same silicon found in the flagship iPhone models released the previous fall. If that pattern holds this time around, the iPhone SE 4 would turn to the A18 system-on-chip powering the iPhone 16. And that would mean the lower-end iPhone SE would support Apple Intelligence features, broadening the audience for Apple's AI tools.

The iPhone SE 4 could be in line to usher in a first for Apple, with rumors suggesting this model will introduce the world to Apple-built modems. Qualcomm has supplied modems for Apple's past phones, but Apple is looking to handle more of its own parts internally.

The bigger screen, more powerful processor and AI capabilities could translate to a bigger price than the $429 cost of the current iPhone SE. So long as Apple keeps the price under $500 -- and with the iPhone 14 still available at a discounted price of $599, you'd imagine Apple would want to -- the iPhone SE 4 could shape up to be one of the best cheap phones we see in 20225.

The annual WWDC event at the start of summer features previews of Apple's software plans, so we're expecting the 2025 developer conference to give us our first look at iOS 19. Early rumors suggest this won't be a major overhaul for Apple's iPhone software, as a lot of Apple's development resources are currently focused on Apple Intelligence.

As a result, Bloomberg's Gurman has reported that a number of features planned for the iPhone software update may not actually arrive until spring 2026, even if they're included in the iOS 19 preview at WWDC 2025. Details as to what those features might be haven't become available at this point.

The current iOS version, iOS 18, supports the same iPhones that were capable of running iOS 17 (though Apple Intelligence is limited to iPhones powered by an A17 Pro chip or later). That's apparently going to continue with iOS 19, according to a report out of France, which claims that the iPhone XS and iPhone XR models will be included among supported devices even if they first launched back in 2018. Not all features may work on older devices, the report cautions.

About the safest prediction anyone can make is that Apple will have new iPhones in the fall. The iPhone 17 lineup is expected to keep three of the current models around -- the standard iPhone as well as the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max. (More on the iPhone Plus replacement in a moment.)

Even though we're at least nine months out from a potential iPhone 17 release, some early details have already started to surface about 2025's big iPhone release. We could finally see the standard iPhone adopt a faster refresh rate after spending years locked at 60Hz. Other flagships in the iPhone's price range have long since adopted fast-refreshing displays of their own, so this would be a significant step by Apple to close the gap with its rivals.

Analysts think the front camera on all iPhone 17 models will get an upgrade with sharper resolution, though the biggest camera improvements could be set for the Pro lineup. Specifically, the iPhone 17 Pro Max will reportedly use a trio of 48MP sensors for its main, ultrawide and telephoto lenses.

We expect all three iPhone 17 models to feature an A19 system-on-chip of some sort, with the Pro phones likely getting a Pro variant. Initial rumors hinted at the A19 being built on a more efficient 2nm process, but now the expectation is that Apple will use a 3nm process once more. The bigger performance story could be an increase of RAM to 12GB across the iPhone 17 lineup, as Apple looks to make its new phones better able to handle on-device AI features.

After holding pricing steady on its iPhone 16 lineup, the iPhone 17 could see a price increase, though it's way too early to say anything definitive about that possibility. If true, though, it would be the first price hike since the iPhone 15 Pro Max jumped by $100 over its predecessor in 2023.

So if there's no iPhone 17 Plus, what does Apple do instead? Most signs indicate Apple is working on a thinner version of its phone, with rumors originally calling this project the iPhone 17 Slim. It's now expected to ship as the iPhone 17 Air, though.

As the original name would suggest, the standout feature of the iPhone 17 Air will be how thin it is. Right now, the iPhone 16 is roughly 7.8mm thin, but the rumored phone is expected to shrink down even more, with some floating the possibility that it could be as thin as the current iPad Air (6.1mm) or iPad Pro (5.3mm).

That kind of slimness won't leave a lot of room for internal components. It's expected that Apple would include just one camera on the back of the iPhone 17 Air -- a 48MP main camera that can do double duty on zooms by cropping in on shots to create 2x zooms at optical quality.

Though it may be knocking the iPhone 16 Plus out of Apple's lineup, don't expect a Plus-like price. Early pricing rumors tip the iPhone 17 Air to be Apple's most expensive iPhone, costing more than even the Pro Max.

Like the rest of the iPhone 17 lineup, the iPhone 17 Air would likely debut in the fall.

There's one other potential Apple phone in the works, though it's probably unlikely to be part of Apple's 2025 plans. Still, it's worth keeping tabs on the rumored iPhone Flip to see if Apple makes any progress toward releasing a foldable phone.

If we're going to see any foldable products coming out of Cupertino, analysts seem to agree that it will be a tablet first. Specifically, analysts point to a 20.3-inch foldable device joining the iPad lineup at some point. When exactly that will be is the subject of some debate, with one analyst predicting a late 2025 launch followed by a foldable iPhone in 2026. But the consensus seems to be that a foldable Apple tablet may not surface until the middle of 2027 at the earliest, pushing back an iPhone Flip release even further.

Regardless, Apple is apparently working on design prototypes for a foldable phone, with a flip-style device being the likely contender. Still, given all the other iPhone activities on its agenda for the next year or so, we'd imagine that iPhone Flip work will be confined to the background.",Tom's Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/iphones/iphone-in-2025-more-ai-new-models-and-maybe-the-slimmest-iphone-ever,2024-12-29,
How Much Does It Cost to Switch to Apple in 2025?,"How to Wirelessly Transfer Files Between Windows, macOS, Linux, and Mobile Quick LinksThe First Step Toward an Apple Ecosystem Is an iPhone An M2-Powered Mac Is Enough for Most AirPods 4 (With ANC) or AirPods Pro 2? Get an Apple Watch to Track Your Fitness Levels Should You Get an iPad? What About Other Apple Devices and Services? And the Grand Total Is... Summary If you plan to switch to Apple in 2025, you'll want an iPhone, a Mac, and some AirPods to create a portable yet functional ecosystem with exceptional connectivity features. You can also get an Apple Watch to track your activities and manage iPhone alerts on the go. At the same time, you might consider an iPad for taking notes or consuming content on the go. Setting up a basic Apple ecosystem could cost you around $1,700 on a budget while getting all five devices could add another $700 to the bill. More modern, higher-end devices will push the price up considerably.

Apple is known for seamless connectivity, enviable privacy, and steep price tags. If you want to create a personal Apple ecosystem in 2025, you'll probably want three of the five primary devices: an iPhone, a Mac, and some AirPods.

✕ Remove Ads The First Step Toward an Apple Ecosystem Is an iPhone

If you're not a fan of the fancy Apple Intelligence features or have heard many friends complain about it, there's no need to go all out on the latest iPhone 16 models or even the iPhone 15 Pro. Instead, you can save hundreds by getting the vanilla iPhone 15.

On its website, Apple sells the regular iPhone 15 (128GB) for $699, placing it between the latest $799 iPhone 16 and the two-year-old $599 iPhone 14. Why not the iPhone 14, you may ask? 2023's iPhone 15 strikes the right balance between affordability and features without being a burden on your pocket.

The iPhone 15 features a brighter screen than the iPhone 14 (2,000 nits vs. 1,200 nits), a more powerful chipset (A16 Bionic vs. A15 Bionic), and a dramatically better primary camera (48MP vs. 12MP). In addition, the Dynamic Island gives the handset a fresh look and you get USB-C charging instead of the outdated Lightning port.

If you're concerned about the storage running out too frequently on a 128GB phone, consider the iPhone 14's 256GB variant, which also costs $699 at Apple. Connecting the phone to a carrier at the time of purchase could help you get another $100 off on the iPhone 14 at Best Buy, reducing the upfront price to $629.99.

Out of the available options, I would pick the iPhone 15 (128GB) and get the basic iCloud+ subscription, adding another 50GB of online storage to my arsenal for $0.99 per month. Further, any new iPhone buyer is eligible to get three months of Apple Arcade for free.

An M2-Powered Mac Is Enough for Most

The M4 MacBook Pro models are among the best in the game, but not everyone needs the latest and greatest. All that processing power demands a serious price, which is why I'd recommend the M2 MacBook Air to students and professionals alike. The baseline M2 chip offers enough power to handle plenty of apps (and Chrome tabs) at once while lasting an entire day of usage without plugging it in.

✕ Remove Ads

Unless you're a full-time video editor, graphic designer, or an architect whose livelihood depends on how fast the machine renders some clips or designs, the M2 MacBook Air is an excellent option for you. Although Apple sells the 13-inch M2 MacBook Air (16GB of unified memory and eight-core CPU) at $999, you can often get the same model at Amazon for $799.

If you don't need a laptop, the M2 Mac Mini makes the most sense. As mentioned by How-To Geek's Tim Brookes in an article about the older Mac mini, ""if all you want is a Mac on which to browse the web, answer emails, and do a bit of office work, M4 is overkill,"" and I couldn't agree more.

While the latest M4 Mac Mini (16GB of unified memory and 256GB of storage) starts at $599, you can get a new M2 Mac Mini (8GB of unified memory and 256GB of storage) on Amazon for $499. If you wish to explore the refurbished or second-hand market, you might be able to shave off another $50 to $100 from the machine's price.

✕ Remove Ads

With the Mac Mini, you'd also need to purchase some peripherals, like a monitor, keyboard, and mouse; they could also cost you a few hundred dollars, depending on the brand and the device you choose. If you're coming from Windows and already have all that stuff, you'll be pleased to hear that there's a solid chance it will all just work with your new Mac.

AirPods 4 (With ANC) or AirPods Pro 2?

While I've already covered the differences between the latest AirPods 4 and the AirPods Pro 2 in a detailed comparison, let's quickly scan through the prices to see which one you should get.

While Apple retails the AirPods 4 (with ANC) for $179, you can buy them for $168.99 on Amazon. However, it makes more sense to purchase the $249 AirPods Pro 2 at a discounted price of $189.99 via Amazon or Walmart.

✕ Remove Ads

By spending $20 more on the AirPods Pro 2, you get better sound quality along with the best noise cancelation in the segment, better battery life, and a couple of exclusive features like Loud Sound Reduction and a clinical-grade Hearing Aid.

I have been using the AirPods Pro 2 for over two years, as I prefer the in-ear design. However, if you like the open-ear design better, you can't go wrong with the AirPods 4 (with ANC).

While these are the three primary devices you need to set up a functional and portable Apple ecosystem in 2025, you can also get the Apple Watch for precisely tracking your activities or workouts and the iPad for taking notes or consuming content on the go.

Get an Apple Watch to Track Your Fitness Levels

The Apple Watch is not just a great smartwatch but also an excellent fitness tracker. Further, it works really well with an iPhone; everything from pairing the watch to tracking physical activities to managing notifications or incoming calls works seamlessly.

✕ Remove Ads

If you're looking for the most affordable Apple Watch model, get the Apple Watch SE 2 (44mm, GPS) at Walmart or Amazon for $219. However, if features like ECG, Car Crash Detection, and Fall Detection are important to you, get the Apple Watch Series 9 or 10 at a discounted price.

The Apple Watch Series 10 (46mm, GPS) can often be found on Amazon for $379, down from the launch price of $429. On the other hand, if you're fine with getting a slightly smaller, thicker, but equally functional model, get the Apple Watch Series 9 (45mm, GPS) for $329 at Walmart.

Should You Get an iPad?

I've had an iPad for over three years now. In the first year, when I didn't have a MacBook, I used the iPad for almost everything from checking my emails, working, surfing the web, watching YouTube, and accessing streaming services. However, ever since I got a MacBook, I haven't used the iPad as much.

✕ Remove Ads

For the last year or so, my younger sister has been using my iPad to take notes, work on college assignments, use social media, and do other similar stuff. I use it, but only when I'm traveling, when my MacBook is out of battery.

Conversely, I have a designer friend who can't let go of her iPad Pro and Apple Pencil Pro. Everywhere she goes, from her college to client meetings and casual outings with her friends, she's always scribbling something or editing a commissioned design on her iPad.

Hence, take a moment to ask yourself whether you really need an iPad, especially if you opt for a MacBook. If you still need one for basic stuff, get the base iPad 10 for $279.00 at Best Buy (down from $349.00).

In my opinion, you should only spend on the iPad Pro if you're a professional. The M4 iPad Pro is available on Amazon for $899 ($100 less than the launch price). Whether you get a regular or a Pro iPad, you get a couple of free subscriptions, including Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, Apple Arcade, and Apple Music (all for three months, except Arcade for up to four months).

✕ Remove Ads What About Other Apple Devices and Services?

We aren't including the newly-launched Vision Pro mixed reality headset in this list, as it isn't a mass-market product (yet).

For $99, you can get the HomePod mini, which delivers surprisingly good sound for its size. However, larger rooms are better off with the regular HomePod 2, which costs $299.

While you might have other audio preferences for portable speakers, the HomePods are the best speakers to pair with the Apple TV 4K, which costs $123.49 at Best Buy. With the streaming device, you also get Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, and Apple Music for three months.

Since you already get complimentary subscriptions to Apple's services with the devices, you can decide which ones you want to continue after the free trial ends.

✕ Remove Ads And the Grand Total Is...

If you get the iPhone 15, M2 MacBook Air, and AirPods Pro 2, it would cost you around $1,700 as per the prices mentioned here (or more if the prices increase).

If you decide to get the Apple Watch Series 9 (45mm, GPS) and the iPad 10, it would cost another $608. Adding an Apple TV 4K streaming device and a HomePod to the ecosystem will add another $230 to the bill.

The more you want, the more you spend. If you go all-out, you're looking at closer to $2,600 for a decent set of ""base"" spec devices.",The How-To Geek,https://www.howtogeek.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-switch-to-apple/,2024-12-28,

While the iPhone 16 boasts cutting-edge features like an upgraded camera system and a faster processor, older models still pack a punch. The iPhone 15,for example,offers a stunning display and remarkable battery life,making it a compelling option for those who don't need the absolute latest technology.

this sentiment is echoed by users on online forums like Quora, where many are debating the merits of upgrading versus sticking with a slightly older model.

The iPhone 11 Pro Max, once a flagship device, is now a budget-friendly option for those seeking a powerful smartphone without breaking the bank. As 2024 draws to a close, many are wondering if this older model still holds up against newer releases.

While newer iPhones boast upgraded cameras and processors, the iPhone 11 Pro Max remains a compelling choice. Its triple-lens camera system continues to impress, capturing stunning photos and videos. The A13 Bionic chip delivers smooth performance for everyday tasks and even demanding games.

The large 6.5-inch Super Retina XDR display offers vibrant colors and sharp details, making it ideal for watching movies and browsing the web. and with a long-lasting battery, you can power through your day without constantly searching for an outlet.

""Historically, Apple has reduced the price of previous generation iPhones by $100-$200 when a new model is announced,"" says tech analyst Sarah Jones.""This year is no exception, with retailers already reporting significant discounts on the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus.""

Retailers are reporting a surge in interest for these discounted models. as Jones points out,this trend highlights a growing awareness among consumers that last year's technology can still deliver a premium experience at a fraction of the cost.

""for many people, the difference between the iPhone 14 and the iPhone 15 isn't significant enough to justify the extra expense,"" Jones explains. ""The iPhone 14 still boasts a powerful processor,an excellent camera,and a sleek design. It's a fantastic option for anyone looking for a high-quality smartphone without breaking the bank.""

"iPhone 15: Price, colors, features, AI, A17 Pro, and more","The iPhone 15 series was announced on September 12, 2023, at Apple's Wonderlust event. Available in four options, Cupertino revamped the standard models while taking the Pro iPhones to the next level. While the iPhone 16 is Apple's newest phone, the company still sells the regular models. Below, you can find all the details on the iPhone 15.

After ditching the classic iPhone X notch in 2022 for the iPhone 14 Pro models, Apple has expanded the new Dynamic Island cutout to all iPhone 15 versions. All four new iPhones offer this new design in 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch displays.

For the regular models, Apple has increased its brightness to 2,000 nits outdoors - twice as much as the previous generation. The back glass is strengthened with an optimized dual-ion exchange process before being polished with nanocrystalline particles and etched to create a textured matte finish. A new contoured edge on the aerospace-grade aluminum enclosure wants to make this iPhone feel nicer in users' hands.

Apple added an ultra-thin bezel for the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max while maintaining the same 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch displays. By adding a titanium design, which is the same used in spacecraft, Apple says it offers one of the highest strength-to-weight ratios of any metal, making this the company's lightest Pro lineup ever.

Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there.

Both models feature a new brush texture and contoured edges. The Pro lineup combines the strength of titanium with the toughest back glass in a smartphone and the industry-leading Ceramic Shield on the front. Using an industry-first thermo-mechanical process, the titanium bands encase a new substructure made from 100 percent recycled aluminum, bonding these two metals with strength through solid-state diffusion. According to Apple, the aluminum frame helps with thermal dissipation and allows the back glass to be easily replaced. This new design highlights the Super Retina XDR display with Always-On and ProMotion technologies for an exceptional viewing experience.

Another change with the iPhone 15 Pro models is the all-new Action button, which replaces the single-function mute switch. Users can now activate several new functions with it, such as:

Apple says that color is infused throughout the back glass for the first time in a smartphone, creating five colors for the iPhone 15 models. These are the options available:

For the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max models, Apple has ditched gold for the first time in favor of these colors:

Interestingly, Apple hasn't released a spring color for the iPhone 15. This is the first time since the iPhone 12 that Cupertino has skipped a new variation of its latest iPhones. Currently, the company only offers the regular iPhone 15 models.

For these new iPhones, Apple is following the same strategy as the iPhone 14 lineup: adding a new chip to the Pro iPhones and using last year's processor to the base-model options.

That said, the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus offer the iPhone 14 Pro's A16 Bionic chip. With two high-performance cores that use 20 percent less power and four high-efficiency cores, the 6-core CPU is faster than the previous generation and handles intensive tasks while saving battery life. The 5-core GPU has 50 percent more memory bandwidth for smooth graphics when streaming videos and playing games.

A new 16-core Neural Engine is capable of nearly 17 trillion operations per second, enabling even faster machine learning computations for features like Live Voicemail transcriptions in iOS 17 and third-party app experiences -- all while protecting critical privacy and security features using the Secure Enclave.

The iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max's A17 Pro chip is the industry's first 3-nanometer chip. With microarchitectural and design improvements, the new CPU is up to 10 percent faster, and the Neural Engine is now up to 2x faster, powering features like autocorrect and Personal Voice in iOS 17. The pro-class GPU is up to 20 percent faster and unlocks entirely new experiences, featuring a new 6-core design that increases peak performance and energy efficiency.

Now, hardware-accelerated ray tracing is 4x faster than software-based ray tracing. Apple even promotes new console titles for this iPhone, such as Resident Evil Village, Resident Evil 4, Death Stranding, and Assassin's Creed Mirage. These games should be played with a gaming controller, such as GameSir Galileo G8's, which BGR recently reviewed.

A few weeks after the iPhone 15 Pro models were released, several users started complaining about their iPhones overheating. While in some cases, it seemed out of nowhere, people thought it could be due to the titanium frame and the A17 Pro chip.

Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said it was not due to the chip, and Apple confirmed that it was software-related. Here's what the company stated:

""The device may feel warmer during the first few days after setting up or restoring the device because of increased background activity. We have also found a bug in iOS 17 that is impacting some users and will be addressed in a software update. Another issue involves some recent updates to third-party apps that are causing them to overload the system. We're working with these app developers on fixes that are in the process of rolling out.""

Apple said Uber, Asphalt 9, and Instagram were among the apps responsible for overheating the iPhone, although it seems they are already working on a fix. Fortunately, it's not affecting all users. Apple said it addressed these issues with iOS 17.0.3 and iOS 17.1, but some users are still experiencing overheating.

These are the storage capacities for all four new models:

For the first time, Apple added a 48MP main lens to the standard iPhones, which helps the device absorb more light in photos. With the quad-pixel tech, the image output will still be 12 Megapixels, but they'll be clearer and crispier. Apple uses Photonic Engine to deliver richer details. This 48MP provides 2x optical zoom. That said, even though Apple didn't add a telephoto camera, you can zoom without losing quality on the standard iPhone model.

For the iPhone 15 Pro, Apple has upgraded the 48MP main camera by giving users the flexibility of using the new 24MP super-high-resolution default. The main camera allows users to switch between three popular focal lengths -- 24 mm, 28 mm, and 35 mm -- and even choose one as a new default. In addition to 48MP ProRAW, the main camera supports 48MP HEIF images with 4x more resolution. iPhone 15 Pro features an expansive 3x Telephoto camera, and the iPhone 15 Pro Max provides the longest optical zoom ever on an iPhone: 5x at 120 mm.

The new Telephoto camera on iPhone 15 Pro Max has an innovative tetraprism design with a combined optical image stabilization and autofocus 3D sensor-shift module, Apple's most advanced stabilization system yet.

All four iPhone 15 models offer some similar camera capabilities. Here they are:

Smart HDR 5: New Smart HDR captures subjects and the background with more true-to-life renderings of skin tones while ensuring photos have brighter highlights, richer midtones, and deeper shadows when viewed in the Photos app. This advanced HDR rendering is also available to third-party apps, so images can look even better when shared online.

Night Mode: It gets better with sharper details and more vivid colors, now powered by the Photonic Engine. iPhone 15 Pro models get improved Night mode portraits thanks to the LiDAR scanner.

Next-generation Portrait mode: For the first time, users can take portraits without switching to Portrait mode. When a person, dog, or cat is in the frame, or when a user taps to focus, iPhone automatically captures depth information so that users can turn photos into stunning portraits later in the Photos app on iPhone, iPad, or Mac. For greater creative control, users can also adjust the focus point after taking the photo.

After Apple announced its Vision Pro spatial computer, BGR wrote that it would be possible for a new iPhone to feature Spatial Video. This function lets you record 3D videos, which will be perfect to watch on the Vision Pro headset.

During its Wonderlust event, Apple announced that the iPhone 15 Pro is the first device to record Spatial Video for Apple Vision Pro. Users can capture precious moments in three dimensions and relive those memories with incredible depth on the company's spatial computer.

All four iPhone 15 models ditched the Lightning port in favor of USB-C. While the regular models get USB-C 2.0, the Pro versions get USB-C 3.0 standards, which gives transfer speeds up to 10 gigabits per second, up to 20x faster than before. That said, users must buy a new cable, which is not the braided one available in the box of this iPhone, to get these transfer speeds.

Unlike the Lightning port on previous iPhones, Apple has been pretty generous with the new USB-C port, meaning you can connect basically any peripheral to this device. With it, you can:

You can also connect your iPhone 15 with:

In addition, these phones also have a new ultrawide-band chip, which I wished Apple would have called U2 instead of ""second generation ultrawide-band chip."" It connects to a device three times farther, unlocking the ability to use Precision Find to find friends in a crowd, for example. I tried the Find My Friend feature at a Taylor Swift concert, and it worked perfectly.

Finally, Apple is adding a new ""peace of mind"" feature called Roadside Assistance via satellite, and it joins the current Emergency SOS via satellite and Crash Detection. With this new function, when users have car trouble and cellular and Wi-Fi coverage are unavailable, they can now connect to AAA, the country's largest roadside assistance provider.

An intuitive interface, including a short questionnaire to capture important details, will transmit the information via satellite so AAA can message the user directly and dispatch help to their exact location. Access to Roadside Assistance via satellite will be included for free for two years. Service is covered according to AAA membership but is also available separately for nonmembers.

Previewed during the WWDC 2023 keynote, the new iPhone 15 models feature iOS 17, released on September 18. This operating system is bringing updates to the Contacts app, FaceTime, while introducing new experiences with a Journal app, mental health awareness focuses, and privacy features, such as removing URL trackers on Safari, adding profiles for Safari usage, and more.

Apple is currently testing iOS 18.3.

There are even several changes for European users, as Apple now allows iPhone sideloading.

Apple is also offering an exclusive feature for EU users. With iOS 17.5, they're able to download apps directly from a developer's website.

This update doesn't offer new features, only bug fixes and security patches.

With iOS 18.1, Apple brings the first batch of Apple Intelligence features to iPhone 15 Pro. These are the main features:

These are all the new Apple Intelligence features available for the iPhone 15 Pro:

All four iPhone 15 models were released on September 22, 2023. As of September 20, 2024, only the regular iPhone 15 versions are available to purchase at the Apple Store.

After the release of the iPhone 16, Apple cut the prices of the regular iPhone 15 models. The Pro versions are no longer available. However, you can see how much Apple sold them from September 2023 to September 2024.

BGR reviewed both the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro Max. These are our thoughts on the standard model:

The iPhone 15 may not represent a massive shift in iPhone development, but it does improve on many aspects of using the phone. The camera is better, the screen is brighter, the phone is more comfortable to hold, and it can finally charge through USB-C. Even when summed, it's probably not worth upgrading from an iPhone 14 -- but if you have an older device, you'll get some solid improvements in the iPhone 15.

2024年对苹果来说是艰难的一年。年初新iPad性能拉胯；年中M4 MacBook未解决笔记本刘海和Face ID问题；Apple Watch多年换汤不换药，Ultra 2更是只更新了新配色；iPhone 16系列的相机按键和AI画饼同样恶评如潮；更不用说""半身入土""、热量全无的Vision Pro了。

毫不夸张地说，除了AirPods 4和M4 Mac mini，苹果今年没有任何值得记录的成功产品。话又说回来，尽管唱衰这家科技大厂的声音从未停息过，但苹果在行业里仍发挥着举足轻重的作用。至少从今年Android品牌对灵动岛和相机按键的致敬上看，苹果在消费电子行业的影响力依旧存在。不管怎么说，苹果还是苹果，作为雷科技2024年度专题的一部分，本文将对苹果的2024进行盘点。

iPad：躺平即可躺赢的平板霸主

2024年5月，苹果发布了新一代iPad Pro，以及配套的新Apple Pencil Pro。其实从硬件跨度的角度看，今年苹果确实给iPad Pro""下了猛药""。配置上，苹果在iPad Pro首发了新一代M4处理器，让iPad Pro的硬件性能有了跨越式的提升。

但这个所谓的跨越式提升，也不完全是M4芯片的功劳。毕竟在2023年，苹果断更了iPad Pro产品线，这导致M4 iPad Pro必须和两年前发布的 M2 iPad Pro对比性能。而从M4 MacBook Pro与M3 MacBook Pro的性能差距来看，M4与M3的性能跨越其实并没有那么大。

当然，除了芯片性能的提升，iPad Pro在屏幕材质、机身厚度方面也做出了些许改进。但作为iPad Pro真正的短板，iPadOS专业应用的缺失，才是近几年拖累iPad Pro销量的核心原因。从M1 iPad Pro起，iPad Pro产品线就进入了硬件超钱、软件跟不上的阶段。在深度体验M4 iPad Pro后，雷科技也认为这款产品""空有一身好武功""。时至今日，微博上仍有大量用户表示""M1 iPad Pro还能再战""。

尽管面向高端市场的iPad Pro未能吸引老用户换新，但于2024年10月发布，主打中端市场的iPad Air、iPad mini却有着不错的市场表现。硬件配置上，新iPad Air终于等来了M2芯片，同时13英寸屏幕的加入也进一步拉近了iPad Air和上一代iPad Pro的距离。可以说除了高刷新率和Face ID外，新一代的iPad Air在性能上已经超越了保有量最大的2018/2020/2021款iPad Pro，成为了""iPad Pro平替""。

说完大屏幕的iPad Air，我们来俩聊小屏幕的第七代iPad mini，尽管它既没有高刷新率屏幕，也没有8GB""AI内存""，更没有M系列芯片，但就像之前我们在讨论小屏平板时说的那样，如今的iPad mini已经以""游戏平板""的身份找到了全新的差异化赛道。

用电竞手机的标准来看，iPad mini没有高刷新率屏幕，但强大的A17 Pro芯片和平板级别的散热能力让iPad mini能以极稳定的帧率运行手机游戏。再加上游戏厂商都会对iOS设备提供专属优化，iPad mini的成功在我看来也属必然。

至于iPad数字系列，其实在iPad Air的围攻下，单纯的数字系列已经没有太大的市场竞争力。再加上苹果一贯的""上一代在二级市场降价当入门""的市场策略，纯数字iPad系列的市场空间早已所剩无几。小雷认为，苹果维系数字iPad系列，其瞄准的目标市场主要有两个：智能收银等半嵌入式商用场景，和面向学校的教育场景。

半嵌入式商用场景非常好理解，毕竟iPad上有大量成熟的企业定制软件，同时苹果的MDM商用设备管理也更为成熟。而针对教育场景，今年苹果也为iPad数字系列设计了专门的键盘，相信能稍微拉近与Chromebook的差距。

这点在苹果2024Q4业绩报告和出货量中也有所体现。根据近三年Q4业绩报告，iPad在22、23、24年Q4的收入分别为71.7亿美元、64亿美元和69亿美元，年收入占比分别为7.95%、7.15%、7.32%。出货量方面，22、23年全年出货量分别为6300万、5000万台，不难看出iPad在2023年""性能停摆""对其销量的影响之大。

iPhone：摆烂与画饼又何妨？果粉自适应

2024年9月，苹果发布了iPhone 16系列。关于iPhone 16系列在硬件上的改动，雷科技已经产出过大量相关内容。这里我们简单总结下，iPhone 16系列在硬件方面的大改动有两点：新增的独立相机控制按键、和为AI而准备的8GB内存。

iPhone 16系列也有细微的小改进，比如Pro系列改用了更窄的屏幕边框，让屏幕尺寸从6.1/6.7英寸提升至6.3/6.9英寸，总算是和安卓大一统了。而至于影像、快充等方面，苹果手机一直都不是安卓的对手，iPhone 16系列的升级完全太够看。

即便如此，在苹果2024财年第四季度949.3亿美元的收入中，仍有462亿美元由iPhone贡献，换句话说，iPhone贡献了苹果2024财年第四季度48%的收入，算得上是苹果收入的中流砥柱。但考虑到今年双十一各大国产手机品牌都获得了相当不错的成绩，如果苹果在2025年新年前后仍未解决AI在中国落地的问题，iPhone在中国市场的销量恐怕会迎来更大的挑战。

Apple Watch：升级几乎没有，退步倒是明显

在iPhone发布会上，苹果同步发布了Apple Watch S10系列。可能是多年的""挤牙膏""行为引起了消费者的反感，苹果今年终于""小改""了Apple Watch的外形：新的Apple Watch屏幕尺寸略微增大，同时机身厚度也略微变薄，甚至芯片型号也""喜加一""，从S9升级到S10。

但和这些微不足道的升级相比，今年Apple Watch的退步更值得我们关注，受有关无线标准的限制，Apple Watch S10、Ultra 2等新手表都不再支持无线快充，曾经""45分钟充电80%""的变成了""90分钟充电100%""，可以说升级不大、退步不少。也正因Apple Watch S10近乎""摆烂""的表现，社交媒体上不少消费者都表示""买旧不买新""，宁愿买上一代的S9也不愿意买最新的S10。

联系到2024前三季度Apple Watch的全球出货量已被华为智能穿戴产品超越，已经十岁Apple Watch，急需像当年iPhone X一样横空出世的Apple Watch X来挽救销量。

AirPods：TWS品类王者，果粉的首选

和Apple Watch S10相比，同时时间推出的AirPods 4反倒更有诚意。得益于全新的AI芯片，苹果给主动降噪能力带到了半入耳式的AirPods 4（ANC）中。除了降噪效果，AirPods 4（ANC）的音质升级也是一大亮点：

和AirPods 3相比，AirPods 4不管是声场表现还是低频质感都有了显著的提升，虽然与真正的HiFi耳机相比还有不少差距，也比不上一些专业音频大厂的旗舰无线耳机，但AirPods产品序列中，AirPods 4的音质仅次于AirPods Pro 2。

不过联系到耳机市场的大环境，苹果对AirPods产品形态与通透模式的坚持，也让其错过了开放式耳机这个全新的品类。当然，考虑到苹果对新产品的谨慎态度，以及用最少产品覆盖最大市场的一贯作风，我认为苹果短期内都不会推出和开放式耳机有关的产品。毕竟在Canalys 2024Q3全球TWS市场出货量的调研中，苹果仍旧以21%的出货占比遥遥领先 -- -- ""既然产品还能卖，为什么要创新呢？""

2024年11月，苹果接连发布了多款采用M4芯片的Mac，除了定位入门的MacBook Air和面向专业用户的Mac Studio、Mac Pro外，其余产品均用上了M4芯片。

从性能水平来看，M4芯片的提升固然明显。但和iPad Pro一样，M4 Mac也面临着软件拖累硬件的问题。简单来说，macOS独特的应用生态让Mac用户分为了两类：对性能要求特别低的轻度用户，和对性能要求特别高的专业用户，两者之间并不存在中间地带。

轻度用户对Mac的性能需求极低，光是从英特尔转到M1芯片带来的提升就已经足够他们的日常使用，后续的M2/M3/M4的性能升级无法构成吸引这些用户升级电脑的竞争力。这一观点在部分海外科技媒体对M4 Mac mini的评测中也有所提及。

而专业用户对设备性能和稳定性有较高的要求，除非工作流发生改变，否则不会轻易更改工作设备。这其实也是主打高端市场的Mac Studio至今还停留在M2 Ultra芯片的原因。

既有用户难以撬动，那Mac的破局点自然来到新用户身上。但Mac产品入门产品的超低性价比又难以吸引未曾尝试过macOS的Windows用户。对此，苹果决定用Mac mini""试水""。2024年的M4 Mac mini改用了全新的模具，大幅缩小的产品尺寸将M4芯片低功耗、高性能的特点体现的淋漓尽致。联系到苹果Mac年中出货量大跌的情况，苹果选择以Mac mini试水""高性价比""，其实也情有可原。

另外，因苹果AI对电脑的内存有16GB的门槛要求，今年Mac mini的起步款也""免费升级""到了16GB内存，省去了过去1500元升级内存的必要花费，让Mac mini的性价比飙升。再加上教育优惠和国家补贴，今年的Mac mini一跃成为全产品线中性价比最高的产品，同时也成为了苹果今年的""年度黑马""。

AI：未来可期还是遥遥无期？

由于苹果AI暂时无法在国内落地，小雷无从评价苹果AI的实际表现。但从近期海外用户的反馈来看，苹果AI的体验还有很大的进步空间。

有海外网友直言，苹果智能中""几乎找不到任何可以让Apple Intelligence在端侧大模型或云端大模型计算的东西，""自己的一切要求，都被跳转到了GPT聊天。另一位网友表示，Siri改了个名字叫Apple Intelligence后，功能等同于媒介。用户询问它问题，它再去问ChatGPT。但Siri不够聪明，ChatGPT也不是特别稳定，双重debuff叠加之下，用苹果智能的体验还不如直接去问ChatGPT。

另外在发布会上，苹果承诺会在25年初上线中文AI，但中国用户什么时候能用上苹果智能，暂时还没人能说得清。在有关规定的要求下，苹果智能想要进入国内，与本土AI大模型供应商合作是苹果最理想、最快捷的道路。只不过从近期苹果与多家本土AI供应商接触的传闻来看，我们也不难看出苹果AI落地中国，似乎还停留在初期阶段。

而在万物AI时代，这种落于人的AI进程，也意味着苹果从AI行业的领导者转变为跟随者。诚然，苹果仍然能够靠着iPhone和品牌守住国内市场。但智能手机未来必将围绕""自动化系统""展开竞争，苹果还能否跟上国产大部队，我们只要看明年苹果AI什么时候才能落地就知道了。

苹果""光鲜""盛景下，危机四伏

如果说硬件销售的家底让苹果保持住了光鲜亮丽的一面，那已经实质性宣告失败的造车计划，和暂时看不到前途的Vision Pro，则构成了今年苹果的另一面。

早在2014年，苹果就曝出造车大业 -- -- 泰坦计划。外界期待它能凭将苹果强大的硬件整合能力与软件生态优势带到汽车行业，在智能电动车领域""杀出""一条新路线。然而多年过去，苹果仍未能拿出可行的方案，反而是内部团队频频调整、领衔高管接连离职。曾经朝气蓬勃的造车计划，已经成为了一个没有目标、凭空烧钱的开发地狱。

终于，在""泰坦计划""曝光10年后，苹果决定为此画上一个句号。根据彭博社报道，苹果首席运营官杰夫·威廉姆斯（Jeff Williams）和负责该项目的副总裁凯文·林奇（Kevin Lynch）共同决定终止这一项目，参与该项目的2000名员工将人工智能部门，未来将工作重心也会放在生成式AI等项目上。这个持续十余年，耗资巨大的项目，就此""泰坦陨落""。

无独有偶，和造车项目类似，Vision Pro也承载着苹果""下一个爆款""的期盼。早在发布之初，它就被视为苹果探索空间计算的重磅布局，是苹果自iPhone、iPad后的又一款开天辟地的产品。

但事与愿违，极高的算力和豪华的传感器配置让Vision Pro的成本高得惊人，即使是苹果的忠实粉丝也难以轻易掏出上数万元来""尝鲜""。雪上加霜的是，Vision Pro高昂的售价和严苛的真机测试条件，让这款脱胎于iOS的硬件设备居然需要""冷启动""。

尽管用户可以在Vision Pro里运行iPad、iPhone的部分软件。但仅凭""爱优腾""显然无法撑起庞大的市场。到最后，普通用户完全找不到为这台价格过高的设备买单的理由。

从声量来看，Vision Pro国内上市仅一个月后就几乎失去所有热度，曾经一号难求的Vision Pro店内体验，如今也变得冷场 -- -- 在Apple Store的预约页面，所有时段都能直接选择。

和过去相比，苹果2024年的表现在我看来只能说刚刚跨过及格线：绝大部分新品都乏善可陈，主力产品iPhone 16系列更是""硬件摆烂、软件画饼""。全年值得一提的设备只剩下AirPods 4（ANC）和因国家补贴变得极具性价比的M4 Mac mini。

不过，小雷也得承认，苹果的经营策略在商业层面上依旧非常成功 -- -- 即使产品竞争力大不如前，仍能稳住949亿美元的Q4营收，甚至超越了22Q4、23Q4的成绩。

展望未来，苹果在2025年大概率仍会维持其保守的产品策略，延续硬件、软件与服务深度交织的经营路径，用""苹果生态""的将用户锁在苹果阵营中。随着全球智能终端市场逐渐饱和，用户必将放缓换手机的频率。这对竞争力下滑的苹果来说固然是个好消息 -- -- 即使已经失去竞争力，苹果仍然能依靠用户使用习惯和生态捆绑，继续维持稳定的收入。

但问题在于，不少国产手机品牌已经开始研究对苹果生态的兼容性了，小米、OPPO、vivo等品牌也接连推出了围绕苹果生态开发的兼容套件。前有频频受阻的AI落地，后有逼近的国产生态，苹果的2025年注定会迎来一场腥风血雨。",cnBeta.COM,http://m.cnbeta.com.tw/view/1466516.htm,2024-12-27,
Apple (AAPL) Stock Ends the Year Near Record Highs,"Apple (AAPL) Stock Ends the Year Near Record Highs

In 2024, Apple Inc. (AAPL) shares surged by approximately 35%, fueled by the introduction of Apple Intelligence, a groundbreaking AI technology integrated into the company's ecosystem. This feature, designed for iPhones and other Apple products, enhances both productivity and user experience.

Following the June launch of Apple Intelligence, AAPL stock price saw a sharp rise (indicated by the arrow), marking the beginning of a steady upward trend within a channel (highlighted in blue) that remains intact.

In early August, a sell-off in Japan's stock market and fears of a global recession defined the channel's lower boundary.

The stock subsequently rebounded, with prices fluctuating around the channel's central line (bolded) throughout autumn. This balance signified equilibrium between buyers and sellers.

As 2024 comes to a close, AAPL shares exhibit a strong upward momentum, resembling a Santa Claus rally. A new, steeper upward channel (depicted in purple) has emerged on the chart.

Analyst Predictions and Market Sentiment

Analysts are optimistic about AAPL's prospects. Daniel Ives of Wedbush recently raised his price target for AAPL from $300 to $325, citing the underappreciated potential of Apple's AI initiatives. Ives believes the company is entering a multi-year iPhone upgrade cycle, driven by artificial intelligence integration.

Looking ahead to 2025, analysts project record-breaking iPhone sales of approximately 240 million units, marking a historic achievement for Apple. This momentum could drive AAPL shares to new highs. While the long-term outlook is positive, near-term risks remain.

Current technical indicators suggest AAPL may face a short-term correction:

- The price is approaching the upper boundary of the channel.

- The RSI indicates overbought conditions, with signs of a potential bearish divergence.

Traders should consider the possibility of a pullback below the key psychological level of $250, with the price potentially retreating to the lower purple boundary.

TipRanks Insights:

- Analysts' average price target for AAPL by the end of 2025: $245.28.

- Among 29 analysts, 19 recommend buying, while 2 suggest selling.

半嵌入式商用场景非常好理解，毕竟iPad上有大量成熟的企业定制软件，同时苹果的MDM商用设备管理也更为成熟。而针对教育场景，今年苹果也为iPad数字系列设计了专门的键盘，相信能稍微拉近与Chromebook的差距。

但问题在于，不少国产手机品牌已经开始研究对苹果生态的兼容性了，小米、OPPO、vivo等品牌也接连推出了围绕苹果生态开发的兼容套件。前有频频受阻的AI落地，后有逼近的国产生态，苹果的2025年注定会迎来一场腥风血雨。",凤凰网（凤凰新媒体）,https://tech.ifeng.com/c/8ferxRMbmtn,2024-12-27,
Umzug leicht gemacht: So klappt der Wechsel von Android aufs iPhone,"Umzug leicht gemacht: So klappt der Wechsel von Android aufs iPhone

| Von: Joerg Geiger

Bei CHIP gibt es eine detaillierte Schritt-für-Schritt-Anleitung, damit der Wechsel von Android aufs iPhone einfach und unkompliziert gelingt.

Nutzer, die sich entscheiden, von einem Android-Smartphone zum iPhone zu wechseln, stehen vor einer Herausforderung. Die Situation sieht so aus, dass Sie unter Android ein funktionierendes System hatten und auf dem iPhone natürlich nicht komplett neu beginnen wollen. Stattdessen soll so viel es geht von Android zu iOS umgezogen werden. Wir helfen Ihnen Schritt für Schritt dabei.

1. Backup des bestehenden Handys

Jetzt ist nicht die Zeit für Hektik. Wir können gut verstehen, dass Sie Ihr neues iPhone schnell in Betrieb nehmen wollen, aber Hauruck-Aktionen gehen oft nach hinten los. Wenn Sie ohnehin immer fleißig Backups von Ihren Handy-Daten machen, können Sie diesen Schritt überspringen.

Ansonsten raten wir dazu, vor dem Umzug ein Backup der Daten Ihres Android-Handys zu machen. Einfach aus dem Grund, weil auf den meisten Handys wichtige Daten schlummern und die sollte man gesichert haben. Google bietet dafür natürlich seine Cloud an, es gibt aber auch lokale Backup-Möglichkeiten.

2. App-Check machen

Machen Sie einen Plan, was Sie alles umziehen wollen. Am besten gehen Sie alle installierten Apps unter Android durch. Die ein oder andere Karteileiche dürfte auf jedem Handy zu finden sein. So ein Umzug ist auch immer ein guter Anlass um abzuspecken. Braucht man wirklich drei Wetter-Apps oder fünf Messenger? Am Ende ist es natürlich Ihre Entscheidung, was Sie alles mitnehmen wollen. Verschaffen Sie sich aber einen Überblick.

Auch wichtig: Neben den Apps müssen Sie auch wissen, welche Nutzdaten Sie mitnehmen wollen. Das sind in erster Linie Fotos und Videos, aber auch Dokumente gehören in die Bestandsaufnahme.

3. Per App automatisch umziehen

Apple stellt mit der kostenlosen Android-App Auf iOS übertragen einen Umzugshelfer bereit. Den installieren Sie sich auf dem bestehenden Android-Handy und packen das neue iPhone schon mal aus und schalten es ein. Sie können jetzt auf dem iPhone mit der Einrichtung loslegen. Wenn Sie auf dem Bildschirm ""Apps & Daten"" ankommen, tippen Sie auf ""Daten von Android übertragen"".

Das iPhone zeigt jetzt einen Code an, der in der App ""Auf iOS übertragen"" auf dem Android-Smartphone eingetippt werden muss. Das iPhone spannt jetzt ein eigenes WLAN auf und sendet eine Verbindungsanfrage an das Android-Handy. Per Fingertipp auf ""Verbinden"" hängen Sie das Android-Gerät in dieses WLAN. Vorteil dabei: Die Daten werden direkt übertragen.

Vorher müssen Sie aber noch genau festlegen, was übertragen werden soll: Grundsätzlich unterstützt die App Kontakte, Nachrichtenverlauf, Kamerafotos und -videos, Fotoalben, Dateien und Ordner, Einstellungen für Bedienungshilfen, Anzeigeeinstellungen, Web-Lesezeichen, E-Mail-Accounts und Kalender.

Die ganze Sache kann eine Weile dauern, speziell, wenn Sie zum Beispiel viele Fotos oder Videos transferieren. Lassen Sie in der Zeit Ihre Handys in Ruhe arbeiten. Sind diese grundlegenden Daten überragen, wird nachgefragt, ob Sie auch die kostenlosen Drittanbieter-Apps übertragen wollen, wenn sie sowohl bei Google Play als auch im App Store verfügbar sind. Ob das sinnvoll ist, sollten Sie mit den Erkenntnissen aus Schritt 2 entscheiden können.

4. Cloud-Apps installieren und fertig

Mit der Übertragung der Daten von Android zu iOS sollten Sie jetzt zumindest die grundlegenden Dinge auf dem iPhone haben. Vollständig zufrieden dürften Sie an dieser Stelle aber noch nicht sein. Entwarnung kann man bei allen Apps geben, die es für Android und iOS gibt und die Daten in der Cloud speichern.

Im schlimmsten Fall müssen Sie sich die Apps laden und sich einmal neu anmelden. Dann sollte dort alles so aussehen wie vorher unter Android. So kriegen Sie Instagram, TikTok oder Spotify an den Start. Besonders wichtig sind in dem Zusammenhang natürlich Passwort-Manager, weil die sämtliche Login-Dateien auch für andere Dienste speichern. Holen Sie sich also Bitwarden oder was auch immer Sie für einen Passwort-Manager verwenden, auch auf iOS.

Wenn Sie Passwörter bisher über Google speichern lassen, klappt der Zugriff auch unter iOS per Google-Konto. Am einfachsten installieren Sie dafür Chrome und tragen diesen in den Einstellungen bei ""Passwörter"" unter ""Automatisch ausfüllen"" ein.

Generell sind Cloud-Speicher-Apps auch eine gute Idee, um Dateien von Android zu iOS mitzunehmen. Dabei ist es egal, auf welchen Anbieter Sie setzen. Sie können Google Drive genauso verwenden wie Dropbox, OneDrive oder Alternativen.

5. Messenger umziehen

Zu den wichtigsten Apps überhaupt zählen Messenger. Hier ist der Umzug oft gar nicht so einfach, wie man sich das vorstellt. Bei WhatsApp können Sie zum Beispiel Chat-Verlaufe in die Cloud sichern, was beim Umstieg auf ein neues Handy hilft. Leider klappt das nur von Android zu Android und von iPhone zu iPhone.

Mit der Apple-App ""Auf iOS übertragen"" gibt es jetzt einen gangbaren Weg, WhatsApp-Chats umzuziehen, der nicht auf teure Drittanbieter-Apps angewiesen ist. Whatsapp bietet eine FAQ-Website an, der Schritt-für-Schritt zeigt, wie Sie den Android-Chatverlauf auf ein neues iOS-Gerät umziehen.

Es gibt aber nicht nur WhatsApp, vermutlich haben sie noch mindestens einen anderen Messenger am Start: Threema-Nutzer können über die Safe-Funktion von Android auf iOS umsteigen. Telegram speichert ohnehin alles in der Cloud, hier müssen Sie sich nur auf dem iPhone anmelden.

6. Spielstände auf iOS bringen

Ebenso nervig wie Messenger können beim Umstieg von Android auf iOS auch die Spiele sein. Jeder hat wohl das ein oder andere Game, das ab und zu mal gezockt wird. Da wäre es cool, wenn man auf dem iPhone nicht neu anfangen muss. Haben die Spiele eigene Benutzerkonten mit Sync-Funktion, sieht es gar nicht so schlecht aus. Dann reicht es, sich das Spiel unter iOS zu holen und sich anzumelden.

Was nicht klappt, ist die Übertragung von Spielständen aus Google Play Games. Im Zweifelsfall müssen Sie bei Spielen, die Ihnen sehr am Herzen liegen, Kontakt mit dem Anbieter aufnehmen. Es kann aber gut sein, dass es einfach keine Lösung gibt und Sie auf dem iPhone wieder von vorn losspielen müssen.

7. Problemfall kostenpflichtige Apps und Abos

Was passiert eigentlich mit kostenpflichtigen Apps, wenn man die Plattform wechselt? Nichts, denn den Kauf haben Sie im Play Store bei Google getätigt, das interessiert den App Store wenig. Was als Tipp häufig genannt wird: Den Hersteller kontaktieren und die Situation schildern, vielleicht kriegt man dann die iOS-Version gratis. In vielen Fällen dürfte es aber einfach darauf hinauslaufen, dass Sie die iPhone-Version nochmal kaufen müssen.

Checken Sie auf jeden Fall auch Abos im Play Store. Die laufen nämlich fröhlich weiter, egal ob Sie die Dienste noch nutzen oder nicht. Kündigen Sie unbedingt Abos, die Sie nicht mehr brauchen.

8. Letzte Feinarbeiten

Mit den oben beschriebenen Schritten dürften Sie das Meiste jetzt auf dem iPhone haben. Ein paar Dinge gibt es aber noch zu beachten. Bei der ein oder anderen App sind noch Nacharbeiten nötig. Beispiel Homebanking: Hier werden Sie das neue Smartphone neu mit Ihrem Konto verknüpfen müssen. Auch das kontaktlose Bezahlen müssen Sie neu einrichten. Google Pay gibt es auf dem iPhone nicht, dafür steht Apple Pay bereit.

Jetzt ist dann auch auf jeden Fall ein längerer Test angesagt. Sind alle Inhalte da, laufen Ihre Apps und können Sie mit dem iPhone alles machen, was Sie sich vorgestellt haben? Falls ja, können Sie Ihr Android-Smartphone zurücksetzen und damit Ihren Systemwechsel amtlich machen.

Bei Problemen stellt Apple übrigens umfangreiche Hinweise für manuelles Umziehen von Apps und Daten bereit. Auch der Apple-Support ist dann eine Möglichkeit, die Sie als neuer iPhone-Nutzer in Anspruch nehmen können.

Umzug in Ruhe ausführen

Auch wenn es sich nur um ein neues Handy handelt, der Umzug von Android zu iOS kann ganz schön knifflig sein. Verantwortlich dafür sind vor allem kleine Baustellen, die aber vermutlich jeder hat, etwa WhatsApp, Spiele oder Bezahl-Apps.

腾讯航海王新游首周iOS吸金3700万，能否碾压其他5款同IP手游？-钛媒体官方网站,"当前高质量漫改手游依然处于极为稀缺的状态，纵观整个国内市场，普遍受玩家认可、高流水、能长线运营的漫改手游仅腾讯魔方工作室旗下的《火影忍者》一款。

11月初发布的《2024中国游戏产业IP发展报告》显示，今年前三季度跨领域IP（文学、影视、动漫等）改编游戏规模达150.8亿元，占国内整体游戏市场7.7%的份额。

虽然占比不算高，但此类IP改编手游在吸量和变现方面（用户付费能力）拥有显著优势，加之版权授权等方面存在门槛，这使得中腰部厂商参与程度不高，赛道竞争缓和，而就改编难度、目标圈层适配度来看，漫改IP又是跨领域IP中的佼佼者。

事实上，每年国内手游市场都会涌现数量不少的漫改手游，据三文游统计，截至今年5月仅上市公司中仍在运营或研发的漫改手游就超过40款，其中腾讯占比近30%。然而遗憾的是，当前高质量漫改手游依然处于极为稀缺的状态，纵观整个国内市场，普遍受玩家认可、高流水、能长线运营的漫改手游仅腾讯魔方工作室旗下的《火影忍者》一款。

不过就在上周，腾讯推出了与《火影忍者》受众同样广泛的《海贼王》IP改编手游《航海王：壮志雄心》，有趣的是网易12月最新推出的英雄射击竞技游戏《漫威争锋》也是一款漫改产品。

《航海王：壮志雄心》值得被关注首先是因为数据表现整体不错，公测5天iOS端流水达2700万；再者其研发团队也是魔方工作室，玩法整体与《火影忍者》趋同，这让其在后续表现以及能否碾压市场上其他《海贼王》IP改编手游的问题上变的需要被讨论；最后则是今年腾讯在国内市场推出了多款新游，该作是2024年上线的最后一款，其位于新游矩阵的位置也反应了腾讯今年的整体表现。

基于上述引发关注的点，点点出海将结合市场上其他《海贼王》IP改编手游的表现、2024年腾讯国内上线新游表现、《航海王：壮志雄心》的市场数据以及下述表格进行详细的分析与拆解。

先来看看《航海王：壮志雄心》的具体情况。

游戏公测前全平台预约人数已经达到2400万，其提前两天也就是12月17日开启预下载，当天以24万日下载（本文国内市场下载及市场数据仅统计iOS端）的成绩登顶iOS游戏免费榜，公测首日达到24.3万的峰值，之后日下载量一直维持在这个水平，没有出现明显的下滑趋势。

截至目前（12月23日，下同），该作公测5天iOS端累计下载量为168万，预估一周iOS下载量应该在220万左右。与之对应的是，其霸榜iOS游戏免费榜长达一周之久，当前虽有下滑，但依然位于第5的位置。

上线至今iOS游戏免费榜排名趋势

iOS端流水方面，首日斩获超390万元，并登上游戏畅销榜第7的位置，震荡上升的趋势一直持续到公测第4天，彼时日流水冲至710万的峰值，之后数据开始缓速下滑，当前日流水在530万左右，与之对应的畅销榜排名也来到了第10。

上线至今iOS游戏畅销榜排名趋势

截至目前，上线5天该作iOS端流水为2700万元，结合当前的趋势，预估一周流水在3700万左右。此外，游戏上线至今的RPD（单个下载收入）已经达到17.96元。

单看《航海王：壮志雄心》的短期成绩是较为亮眼的，但如果将其放到整个《海贼王》IP漫改手游的赛道中，其是否依然能独占鳌头？

答案似乎是肯定的，因为这条赛道还没有头部产品。

纵观整个国内市场，有一定声量和知名度的《海贼王》改编手游只有5款（不含《航海王：壮志雄心》），其中大部分在玩法类型上选择了回合制卡牌，与《航海王：壮志雄心》一样选择动作格斗方向，从而形成更直接竞争的只有《航海王：热血航线》，而该作恰恰也是该赛道之前表现最好的产品。

上线于2021年4月22日的《航海王：热血航线》已经运营了3年多，它是字节押注游戏业务时首款冒头的明星产品。

上线初期凭借3D格斗吸引了很多苦传统卡牌久已的海贼漫改手游玩家，剧情架构、养成、探索、PVP组成的完整且较为成熟的游戏体验，加上在KOL、UGC等方面的集中发力让其首月iOS流水飙升至1.9亿，畅销榜排名更是没有低于TOP15，一时之间风头无两。

然而高流水持续的时间并没有很久，首月过后该作的iOS月流水开始快速下降，直到在半年后的2021年10月稳定到了2500万左右，在整个2022年其iOS月流水虽偶有增长但也是在2000万至3500万之间浮动，2023年月流水的浮动区间降至2500万至1000万之间，目前其iOS月流水已经彻底回落到1000万以下（11月流水为930万），但依然是所有海贼手游中月收入最高的产品。

值得一提的是，去年末字节游戏宣布退出游戏业务，过程中虽然让不少《航海王：热血航线》玩家产生恐慌，但后来游戏更新和运营表明变动对项目影响有限，目前该项目组已经并入新成立的上海ZERO36工作室，稳定的外部环境对产品的长线运营是利好的。

截至目前，《航海王：热血航线》日常投放收缩明显，iOS月下载在9万左右，但营收能力还算合适，iOS年流水下降率在35%左右，iOS端累计总收入为11.4亿，对比同时段其他海贼手游形成碾压之势力。

处于第二梯队的产品是云畅游戏研发、灵犀互娱发行，早在2018年9月20日开启不删档测试的《航海王：燃烧意志》，2021年至今，其iOS端累计流水预估达2.4亿元。

游戏采用3D建模在当时一众2D漫改中较为亮眼，""MMO+回合制卡牌""的玩法中规中矩，但剧情还原方面获得了一定认可。

据悉，该作发布的第二年，云畅游戏2019年报就显示全年净利润同比增长183.42%。

观察游戏近4年的表现，2021年4月之前iOS端月流水还维持在1000万以上，但5月开始月流水便开始震荡下滑，同年12月仅为350万，2021年iOS总流水为9310万已经不足1亿。

为了转变颓势，游戏于2022年1月初正式上线了《航海王：燃烧意志》2.0，开启了新剧情篇章、新等级上限、航海模拟战、抽卡保底、英雄觉醒等内容。升级过后游戏有一定增益，但提升并不明显，月均iOS流水450万左右打转，而9月的周年庆版本明显对游戏的增益更大，流水冲到了875万。

时间来到2023年，该年结束时其iOS月流水已经来到了250万左右，相当不理想，但今年3月28日推出的怀旧服让其稍微缓过来一口气，月流稳定在400万以上变成常态，11月达到了476万元是所有海贼漫改游戏收入第二高，其2024年至今的流水为4610万，同比去年增长了约20.1%。

第三梯队的游戏有两款，分别是2015年1月上线的国内首款海贼王正版手游《航海王：启航》，以及2016年1月上线的《航海王：强者之路》，它们的运营时间分别是10年与9年，当前月流水均在100万至200万之间，年流水则是在2100万左右。

由DeNA中国自研自发的《航海王：启航》，是一款Q版放置卡牌手游，当时的DeNA中国区副总裁罗云曾对外表示，游戏首月双端流水约为6000万元。

但就流水而言，2021年时，其月iOS流水一路从年初的630万一路下降至年末270万，2022年处于维稳，但2023年却迎来再次下滑，月均流水在120万左右，年末3.0公测虽然有用，但其效应只延续至今年上半年，当前游戏流水回落至170万，今年iOS年流水2320万元同比去年小幅增长了12.1%。

2021年至今该作iOS端累计流水预估为1.25亿元。

《航海王：强者之路》比《航海王：启航》晚上线一年，是中手游研发的一款回合制卡牌游戏，采用竖版操作与卡片战斗，养成系统与游戏节奏不繁重，但战斗表现力一般。

事实上，上述两款游戏如果成为当前海贼改编表现最差的手游并不会令人意外，毕竟漫长的运营时间在那放着，然而这项殊荣却被今年4月1日上线的3D回合制卡牌《航海王：梦想指针》拿下。

该作最早是朝夕光年旗下项目，后来随着字节游戏业务的变动，研发团队变成了千寻社，其中核心成员基本都来自字节原项目，同时发行也转交给雷霆游戏与奥飞游戏。

《航海王：梦想指针》公测首日就冲上了iOS游戏免费榜头名，畅销榜排名最高则是23名，首月iOS流水为1340万，然而之后成绩开始一落千丈，次月流水便跌至240万，11月更是不足10万。

纵观这些年的海贼类漫改手游会发现，其美术表现从2D逐渐发展至3D、类型也从放置、回合制卡牌扩充到MMO以及动作格斗，虽然一直未有头部产品出现，但发展是可以期待的。

就具体产品而言，当前《航海王：壮志雄心》的表现高于国内任何一款海贼IP手游，但如果《航海王：壮志雄心》一直保持首周的表现，其首月流水应该会与《航海王：热血航线》同期齐平，两者初期表现并没有拉开明显差距，未来竞争还将持续。此外《航海王：燃烧意志》是除这两款动作游戏外唯一在数据上还有一战之力的海贼赛道产品。

正如《航海王：热血航线》最初将《火影忍者》作为目标一样，《航海王：壮志雄心》的目标其实也是一致，高流水与长久的生命力才是核心目标。

但就实际数据来看，已经运营8年多（2016年5月19日公测）的《火影忍者》近一年iOS游戏免费榜没有低于TOP40，畅销榜基本稳定在TOP25。iOS收入方面，2021年至今累计流水达到36.4亿元，今年预估在13亿左右（月流水在8000万至1.5亿之间浮动），同比去年增加了53%。

如此看来，公测加持的《航海王：壮志雄心》与目前《火影忍者》的营收能力差不多，但随着常规运营期的到来，前者大概率会出现疲软甚至下滑，因此想要达到后者的成绩和赛道地位是比较难的，如何维持可观的长线运营成绩显然更值得思考。

从更宏观的公司层面来看，在今年腾讯国内上线的11款重点新游中，首周iOS流水能超越《航海王：壮志雄心》的仅有爆款《DNF手游》（首周2.35亿元），后者iOS总流水达47.2亿，是2024年国内新游无可争议的TOP1。

《航海王：壮志雄心》算是腾讯新游第二梯队的产品，该梯队还包括开放世界竞速游戏《极品飞车：集结》、SLG《世界启元》、FPS跨端游戏《三角洲行动》，MOBA《宝可梦大集结》。

它们都是下半年上线，iOS总流水基本都在1亿元左右（不包含《宝可梦大集结》，11月初上线运营时间过短），但就11月流水而言，仅有《三角洲行动》超过3000万达到了4200万，加上PC端数据无法统计，实际数据必然更高。

值得关注的是，虽然《极品飞车：集结》国内表现下滑严重，但其10月底便上线了港澳台市场，目前累计流水为1790万，位于台湾iOS游戏畅销榜第62，但整体不如网易旗下运营一年多的《巅峰极速》，其仅11月港澳台流水为2500万。

即时策略RPG《白荆回廊》、MMORPG《二之国：交错世界》、MMORPG《塔瑞斯世界》、开放世界抓宠《创造吧！我们的星球》以及合成模拟经营《庄园合合》则表现较为糟糕，位于第三梯队。

这5款游戏中，《白荆回廊》与《塔瑞斯世界》短期数据不错，首月iOS流水分别达到3480万和1870万（不包含PC端），但后续下滑严重，其11月iOS流水都不足200万。其余3款新游的糟糕表现则是贯穿整个测试周期，11月iOS流水都没有超过30万。

显然，尽管新游数量不少，但除了800万勇士加持的《DNF手游》，剩下的产品并没有表现出足够的潜力，《航海王：壮志雄心》有机会但要避免《航海王：热血航线》一样的发展路线。",tmtpost.com,https://www.tmtpost.com/7398060.html,2024-12-27,
31 Must-Know iPhone Hacks to Make Your Life Easier,"One of the standout productivity features in iOS 18 is the ability to schedule messages in the iMessage app, allowing you to send messages at a specific date and time. Note that this feature only works if the recipient is also using iMessage; it won't function with non-iPhone devices, even those with RCS enabled.

How to Schedule Messages in iMessage:

If you're using an iPhone or an iPad, you can watch your favorite series on Netflix or Apple TV+ without worrying about killing the device's battery because you fell asleep in the middle of an episode. That's because Apple offers a sleep timer for every media playback.

And the best part is that you can use it for all apps that play media content on your Apple device -- it can also be set for children's watch time on iPads for instance. To do that:

Do we really need multiple timers? Well, I do. Here at nextpit, we constantly review smartphones and tablets, and sometimes the battery tests can be quite laborious. If you lose track of time, you might end up having to redo the entire recharging test.

So, yes, the ability to set multiple timers simultaneously is very helpful in these circumstances. And now, iOS offers this option. Setting up and running multiple timers is simple:

Streaming the content of the iPhone screen on the TV is possible via the AirPlay feature. Similar to Miracast, this function allows you to mirror your iPhone screen on compatible TVs or connected to the Apple TV streaming device. To do so, you will need to access the iPhone control panel and activate the shortcut for AirPlay and follow these steps:

An important note here: the list of TVs compatible with AirPlay 2 is still small, including models released from 2018 by manufacturers LG, Samsung, Sony, TCL and Vizio. The updated list can be checked on Apple's website and also includes some devices with Amazon Fire TV and Roku systems.

It is worth remembering that, in the case of both AirPlay and Miracast, some applications may prevent the transmission of content to the TV, either for technical reasons or due to certification requirements. To learn more about the topic, check out this tutorial on how to connect your iPhone to your TV.

Apple products work well together. You can't use Universal Control on the iPhone, but with Apple's iTunes Remote app, you can manage Apple Music on your PC or Mac from your iPhone or iPad.

This is handy for changing playlists or albums from your couch without getting up. The iTunes Remote app is free in the Apple Store and lets you control Apple Music remotely from your iPhone. Here's how to do it:

If you are keen to learn more about the iTunes Remote app, I recommend reading our special guide on how to control Apple Music on the PC or Mac from your iPhone.

As you might know, when you toggle the Wi-Fi or Bluetooth buttons in the control center shortcut, it doesn't really mean you've turned them off. This action simply indicates that Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on your device are disconnected. However, both settings will continue to be available.

Apple designed this feature so that you can continue using certain accessories and features, such as specific devices or services that allow users to share files and other media across multiple Apple devices.

In iOS 17, however, Apple added a shortcut to immediately deactivate settings like Wi-Fi, and even provide access to Airplane mode. As an iPhone 14 Pro Max user, this is a lifehack that saves you from making unnecessary extra clicks. Here's how you do it:

Just edited a photo or video and found the perfect combo of filters and settings? If you don't want to lose your genius cut and apply the effect to other photos and/or videos without starting over, you can copy an edit.

Since iOS 16, you can drag and drop text, files, and photos between apps on the system. While not very popular, it's definitely a great multitasking feature.

By using the 'lift subject from background' option along with the drag-and-drop feature, you can isolate specific objects in an image, removing the background, for example, or even select passages of text. Apps that enable background removal from images include Photos, Quick Look, and Safari.

This tip is designed for situations where you invite people to your house. Instead of dictating your password to your guests, you can easily share it. Don't worry, the clipboard to copy your Wi-Fi password is Face ID-protected and the copy-and-paste works even with the password hidden on your screen.

This might seem overly simple, but it's a feature that was definitely missing in Apple's camera app. If you're a meticulous casual photographer like me, you'll appreciate knowing that you can add a level directly to the camera app screen. This ensures that any slant in your composition is intentional, not accidental.

To enable the level icon in the camera app on your iPhone, follow these steps:

iOS is not the most bespoke user interface in the wide world of smartphones. However, it is undeniably getting more and more customizable, much to the chagrin of many fans.

If you're the type who likes an original UI, the Shortcuts app allows you to easily transform application icons on the iPhone home screen, making unique color combinations and much more.

Of course, you can choose to use a third-party app for this, but the Shortcut tool offers a range of options in line with Apple's nitpicky design guidelines and, what's more, can be exploited for automation of routines in iOS and other shortcuts.

Find out more on how to create custom icons and other tricks to make your iPhone home screen truly unique.

If you're on a voice or FaceTime call and your hands are full, you can hang up using Siri.

The Safari app lets you open up to 500 tabs at once. I don't know who really uses that many tabs, and it would drive me totally nuts, personally. But let's say you have a dozen open, being able to pin a few of them can be very handy.

Not only can you pin multiple tabs, but you can also pin tabs that are part of tab groups so that they are permanently open. Just repeat the same steps listed above, but after opening the chosen tab group.

Another incredibly handy feature recently added to the operating system is the ability to ping your Apple Watch directly from the control center. This is especially useful for those who frequently misplace their devices.

To enable the ""ping Apple Watch"" feature on your iPhone, follow these steps:

If customization is critical to you, you now can choose which features are more relevant to you in your Messages app, with the option to rearrange them. The process couldn't be simpler.

If you're tired of hanging up on people unintentionally after accidentally pressing your iPhone's lock button, you can turn this option off.

Haptic feedback is nothing new on iOS except for the native keyboard which was previously without it. In iOS 16, you can now enable vibration for typing on your iPhone keyboard.

Apple introduced Cinematic Mode and Photographic Styles with the release of the iPhone 13 series. As these features are hardware-dependent, only owners of the iPhone 13 series and newer models can fully utilize these functions.

In our special article on tips for using Cinematic Mode, we show you how the video feature works and the different ways to edit footage during and after recording. If you have a compatible device, you can learn how to capture video with a blurred background and understand how you can automatically change the foreground object or person in a shot.

When it comes to Photographic Styles, Apple's latest generation smartphone camera lets you apply the same changes in hue, temperature, and saturation as traditional filters, but takes advantage of the iPhone's hardware to provide a different result compared to existing methods. Here's how to optimize the use of Photographic Styles on the iPhone.

Since iOS 15 Apple offers an advanced option to use YouTube in a floating window. The function is known as Picture-in-Picture (PiP), and makes it possible to minimize YouTube videos on the iPhone screen. However, to enable YouTube's Picture-in-Picture mode on the iPhone a Premium subscription to Google's streaming application is required.

If you're anything like me, you are also a YouTube Premium subscriber. First, you need to sign up as a trial user, then the function will be automatically available on your iPhone. On the other hand, if you want to remain YouTube-free, our tip is to download the PiPifier app directly from the App Store.

We show you the complete step-by-step in this tutorial on how to enable Picture-in-Picture mode on YouTube. And here is a short version of it:

Of all the iOS tips, turning your iPhone keyboard into a trackpad is by far the most useful lifehack, and I revel in using it almost every day. It's actually a basic trick, one that most iOS users don't know of and perhaps even less popular than the function to dim the iPhone's flashlight.

To quickly place the Apple standard keyboard cursor in a strategic position, just long press the space bar and wait until the letters disappear. After that, without removing your finger from the display, you can move the cursor as you please, and you can edit text ""like a pro""!

Check out our complete guide on how to turn your phone keyboard into a trackpad.

Ok, this tip is as old as activating Dark Mode on iPhone, but it still goes unnoticed by most people. Beyond simply taking screenshots, the Back Tap feature offers a wealth of features and shortcut options using two or three taps on the back of the iPhone.

The sensational thing about this feature is that it supports models from iPhone 8 onwards, and besides being an important accessibility tool, it also functions as shortcuts to important system software, such as the camera and -- in my case -- Shazam.

To enable the Back Tap feature on your iPhone, follow these steps:

The Photos app received a major overhaul in iOS 18, featuring a redesigned interface with rearranged buttons and shortcuts. Apple also introduced more customization options, including the ability to pin albums and adjust the app's layout.

You probably already know that you can connect a PS4/PS5 or Xbox One S/X and Xbox Series S/X controller via Bluetooth to your iPhone.

But if you have a Nintendo Switch, you can also connect your Joy-Con to your iPhone. What's nice about this trick is that you normally have at least two Joy-Cons and each of them can be used as a separate controller. You can also connect each Joy-Con, be it the right or the left one, independently to the iPhone.

Well, I don't know many mobile games with local multiplayer, but if you do, you should like this trick. To do this:

The photo app has a new utility feature that allows you to detect and merge photos that you have multiple copies of. If you want to free up some storage space:

According to Apple, merging duplicates ensures that the image is kept with the best quality and the metadata is combined consistently.

Since we're on the topic of cameras, here's an extra tip on using zoom to crop photos. Given that your phone's main camera can capture photos with a significant amount of detail, the 'zoom to crop' feature can help you maintain image quality while magnifying the image simultaneously.

Here's how to make the most of the 'zoom to crop' option:

Unlike Android, iOS doesn't like long presses. Whether it's to select or access a contextual menu, Apple always prefers to make you perform multiple actions rather than rely on a single long press. This is the case, for example, when deleting a contact. First, you have to select the contact, edit it, and then press the delete button.

Now, it is much more intuitive as you can delete a contact in iOS 16 using a single long press:

If you own an iPhone or Apple Watch, setting up Apple Pay will help you to deepen your devices' potential. Apple's contactless payment platform works together with Apple Wallet and offers a bunch of options. From payment card integration to ID card storage, Apple Wallet can be extremely convenient.

With your credit or debit card set up, you can easily make purchases using just your iPhone to check out in stores with Apple Pay. So, to set up a new debit or credit card in the Wallet app, you will need to set up Apple Pay from your iPhone. We do have an in-depth tutorial on how to set up Apple Pay, however, here is a short version of it:

Another significant privacy enhancement in iOS 18 is the ability to lock or hide apps from the home screen. This feature requires authentication via Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode, keeping your apps and sensitive data secure.

Apple's native note-taking app now allows you to protect your notes with a password and/or Face ID. This is a very handy trick if you store sensitive content like IDs and passwords or any other sensitive information on your handset.

You can either use your iPhone password (and sync it to your iCloud Keychain) or create a new password just for your notes. Once you've chosen a password, you can opt for the second level of protection with Face ID.

When you open the note, you can then lock it by pressing the padlock icon in the toolbar at the top. Its contents will only be visible after you enter the correct password or scan your face to unlock it.

To lock your notes in iOS:

From iOS 17 and above, Apple offers a resetting passcode window on the iPhone. However, this feature is only available for 72 hours after changing your passcode.

Here's a concise step-by-step tutorial about this brand-new iOS 17 feature for resetting a forgotten iPhone passcode:

Starting with iOS 17, the first time you open Safari, you'll be presented with a Private Browsing locker. I recommend activating it immediately. The reason is straightforward: it adds an extra layer of privacy to your phone.

To activate it, simply click the tabs icon button in the bottom-right corner of Safari, slide to the private tab, and grant the browser permission to use your Face ID. Once set up, swiping from left to right will open your private tabs, ensuring they remain accessible only to you.

Well, these are some of the best iOS functions and usage tips for iPhone users for now. What do you of the features shared here? What's your tip for getting the best out of your iPhone?

The best VPNs to use on iPhones in 2025,"The iPhone is famed for being one of the most secure smartphones on the market. But that doesn't mean it's necessarily immune to all online threats, which are rapidly growing in frequency and sophistication.

In fact, if you're currently reading this article on an iPhone, you may begin seeing random VPN adverts all over the internet. That's because advertisers are tracking your web browsing habits and using this information to bombard you with targeted adverts.

Luckily, you can stop all this internet eavesdropping and add an extra layer of security to your iPhone by installing a virtual private network (VPN). VPNs encrypt your internet traffic, route it through a secure connection between your iPhone and a remote VPN server, and conceal your internet protocol address, the unique number assigned to any internet product.

Along with helping to improve the security and privacy of your iPhone, a VPN will also let you unblock geo-restricted content. They will make it look like your iPhone is being used in a different country. So, if you live in the US but want to watch a hot new TV show that's only shown in the UK, you can easily access it by connecting to a British VPN server via your iPhone.

RELATED: What is a VPN and how does it work? and the best free streaming services

Today, many different VPN services are available to download via the App Store on your iPhone, with the best providers offering large server networks, a range of leading VPN protocols, easy-to-use apps, access to top streaming services, robust online protection, and much more. But to simplify things, we've ranked the top iPhone VPNs of 2024 - starting with our top pick, Norton VPN.

Free version: No, Server count: 28 locations, Protocols offered: IPSec/IKEv2

Any iPhone user who wants robust cybersecurity features as part of a VPN package should check out Norton VPN Ultimate. Designed on top of the cybersecurity giant's leading antivirus software, this app has everything you need to protect your iPhone from the latest online threats.

Norton VPN Ultimate will keep the whole family safe online, too. It has tools for blocking adult content, setting screen time limits, and tracking the locations of kids' iPhones.

On the VPN side of things, it has servers in 28 countries, an auto-connect feature that will secure your iPhone when you use public Wi-Fi networks, a no-logging policy, banking-grade encryption, and support for up to ten devices. You can currently buy this premium VPN service for $59.99 in the first year, which includes a 60-day money-back guarantee and a free trial.

Free version: No, Server count: 6800, Supported protocols: NordLynx, OpenVPN, and IKEv2/IPsec

NordVPN is one of the top iPhone VPNs thanks to its easy-to-use iOS app, a large network of high-speed and reliable servers, an extensive suite of advanced online security features, and Siri shortcuts.

Supporting iPhones running on iOS 15 or newer, the NordVPN app is very straightforward to navigate. You can quickly secure your iPhone's internet connection by pressing the 'quick connect' button. If you want to connect to a NordVPN server in a specific country, you can find it easily using an interactive world map or a comprehensive list of international locations. There's no shortage of NordVPN servers, either - you can choose from 6800 in 113 countries.

With Nord VPN's market-leading NordLynx protocol available for iOS devices, you can enjoy blazing-fast and reliable VPN connections on your iPhone. You also have the option to use a different VPN protocol in the NordVPN app settings, including OpenVPN and IKEv2/IPsec.

Thanks to AES 256 encryption, ad blocking, a malware scanner, a kill switch that disables internet access when your VPN connection unexpectedly disconnects, and a dark web monitor that alerts you if your accounts are breached, NordVPN will protect your Apple device from all manner of online threats.

Compatible with streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, BBC iPlayer, Disney+, and Hulu, NordVPN is also perfect for people who spend a lot of time streaming movies and TV shows on their Apple devices. Another highlight of the NordVPN iOS app is its Siri shortcuts, which allow you to connect to a VPN server using your voice.

Free version: No, Server count: 3200, Supported protocols: Wireguard and IKEv2

If you're looking for a premium iOS VPN that won't dent your wallet, look no further than Surfshark. With subscriptions costing as little as $1.99 a month and great features like unlimited connections for securing all your Apple devices, Surfshark represents excellent value for money.

Surfshark's iOS app is also user-friendly, with a quick-connect button that finds the fastest-available VPN server, and it'll work on any iPhone running on iOS 13 or later.

By connecting to one of Surfshark's 3200 global servers, you'll be able to unblock streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, HBO Max, Hulu, and BBC iPlayer in any part of the globe on your iPhone.

ExpressVPN is another well-known VPN provider that offers a well-rounded and easy-to-use iPhone app that works on iOS 15 or later. By clicking the large power button, you can secure your iPhone with the best available ExpressVPN server within seconds. However, you can also pick one manually.

With servers in 105 countries, ExpressVPN will allow you to unlock geo-restricted web content on your iPhone anywhere in the world. Not to mention, 80% of them offer 10Gbps speeds for buffer-free streaming and online gaming. ExpressVPN supports top streaming sites like Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, HBO Max, and BBC iPlayer.

Another great thing about ExpressVPN's iOS app is that it supports the proprietary Lightway protocol, which is designed to offer fast, secure, and reliable VPN connections. This is alongside standard VPN protocols such as OpenVPN and IKEv2/IPSec.

Using ExpressVPN on your iPhone, you get AES 256 encryption, an internet tracker blocker, an ad blocker, an adult content blocker to protect your children online, a password manager, a kill switch, and more. With prices starting at $4.99 a month, ExpressVPN isn't the cheapest iPhone VPN provider on the market. But you can take it for a spin before committing to a premium plan thanks to a 7-day free trial available through the App Store.

Free version: No, Server count: Around 35,000, Supported protocols: OpenVPN, IKEv2 and WireGuard

Private Internet Access is best known for offering one of the largest server networks of all VPN providers, which is thought to total 35,000 servers. And the great news is that you can access all these servers on iPhones running on iOS 12.1 or higher.

Free version: No, Server count: 2400, Protocols offered: IKEv2, IPSec, and WireGuard

IPVanish has all the bells and whistles of a top iPhone VPN, including an easy-to-use app that lets you connect to a fast VPN server in seconds, servers spread across over 135 locations, a choice of leading VPN protocols, and more.

With IPVanish, you have over 2400 servers at your disposal, which are protected by strong encryption and a strict no-logging policy. They'll let you securely stream on popular platforms like Netflix, HBO Max, Hulu, ESPN+, and BBC iPlayer.

IPVanish starts at $2.19 a month, and you can get a free trial.

Free version: Yes, Server count: 1,800, Supported protocols: Hydra

Hotspot Shield is among the fastest VPN services available on iOS. This largely comes down to its proprietary Hydra VPN protocol, which is specially optimized to deliver fast and reliable connections perfect for streaming, playing games, downloading large files, and torrenting.

If you plan on using Hotspot Shield to conduct such activities, you won't need to worry about running out of data as you get unlimited bandwidth. In particular, Hotspot Shield is an effective VPN for streaming on your iPhone, offering access to top platforms like Netflix, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Twitch, and Hulu.

With 1800+ servers across 80 countries and 35 cities, you shouldn't have any problems accessing the various international libraries offered by these platforms. When it comes to using them, just simply press the 'connect' button in the iOS app to get connected. The Hotspot Shield app works on iOS 14 or later.

Because Hotspot Shield uses military-grade encryption, you can browse the web on your iPhone without the threat of eavesdropping by broadband providers, advertisers, and cybercrooks. Plus, you can protect up to ten devices simuliteanously with a single Hotspot Shield account.

A premium plan will cost you $6.66 a month, making Hotspot Shield more expensive than some of the other iPhone VPNs we've listed. But you can sign up for a seven-day free trial, and there's a lengthy 45-day money-back guarantee. Hotspot Shield also offers a free, unlimited subscription.

When it comes to choosing the best iPhone VPN, there are a few key things to consider. Firstly, you'll want to ensure that the provider in question takes security and privacy seriously. They should provide robust encryption techniques like AES 256 and a strict no-logging policy at the bare minimum.

It's also essential to research how many servers and locations are offered by VPN providers and whether their connections are reliable or not. A top VPN service will usually have thousands of servers in all corners of the globe, making it super easy to unblock geo-restricted content on your iPhone.

Another important consideration is how user-friendly an iPhone VPN app is - for example, a quick-connect button will let you begin using a speedy VPN server in seconds. Plus, you must ensure the app is compatible with your iPhone - you can find this information on the App Store.

If you've never used a VPN service before, you may want to think about signing up for a VPN service that offers a free trial. Or you could download a trustworthy free VPN app. The best VPN companies also offer 24/7 support.

All of the providers we've ranked in this list offer various different features to keep iPhone users safe and secure online.

But NortonVPN is arguably the safest option because it's designed on Norton's leading antivirus software. Plus, it's more than just a VPN service; it offers antivirus, parental controls, and many other cybersecurity tools.

Our other top pick is NordVPN because it offers strong encryption, protection against a range of online threats, a secure protocol in the form of NordLynx, and more.

Using a VPN on your iPhone can, indeed, slow it down. This is mainly due to the time and resources involved in the encryption and data routing processes that underpin VPN services. But if your iPhone is impacted by internet throttling -- which is when internet service providers slow down customers' broadband speeds on purpose -- a VPN could actually make your phone faster by tackling this issue.

If you're rocking an older iPhone that's showing its age, this is a prime opportunity to snag a powerful newer model at a more affordable price. The iPhone 13 and iPhone 14 still pack a punch and offer excellent value for the money.

However, if your current iPhone is still performing well and meets your needs, it might be worth waiting to see what the iPhone 15 brings to the table before making a decision.

Newsdirectory3: What are some key considerations for consumers weighing their options?

Mark Johnson: Think about your budget, of course, but also consider your phone's overall performance. Are you experiencing any issues with your current device? Do you crave specific features found in newer models? Weighing these factors against the attractive deals on offer can help you make an informed choice.",News Directory 3,https://www.newsdirectory3.com/24-daftar-harga-hp-iphone-terbaru-jelang-tahun-baru-2025-sudah-termasuk-iphone-16-tribun-shopping/,2024-12-26,
Should I Buy AppleCare+ for My Christmas Gift?,"Merry Christmas! If you've been fortunate enough to find a shiny new Apple product under the tree this year, then these are special times indeed. You'll want to take good care of it. For many folks, that means slapping a case or screen protector on your new iPhone or iPad and being careful not to swallow your AirPods.

There's an ongoing debate about whether you really need a case for your iPhone. Like some of us, you may choose to ""go commando"" and live with the risks. After all, the iPhone 16 is such a gorgeous piece of technology that it's a shame to hide it, especially if you've ended up with sleek colors like Ultramarine or Desert Titanium.

The consequences of dropping an unencased iPhone may not be as dire as you think, thanks to Apple's Ceramic Shield glass, which has been upgraded for the iPhone 16 to be twice as durable and 50% tougher. However, tests have proven that it doesn't make your iPhone indestructible, and even on the iPhone 16, it's still likely the pavement will win if you drop your iPhone hard enough.

Still, if wrapping your iPhone in a case is abhorrent to you, there's another way to get some peace of mind: purchase an AppleCare+ plan.

If you're really fortunate, Santa may have already added AppleCare+ to your new iPhone, but don't worry if he didn't -- you still have up to 60 days to purchase it, and you can do so right from the Settings app.

While many folks think of AppleCare as merely an extended warranty, it's always been much more than that -- even in the years before Apple added the ""Plus.""

Early versions of AppleCare certainly extended the warranty on the iPhone and other Apple products, adding 1-2 more years to the standard coverage -- ""Apple's Limited Warranty"" -- depending on the product. However, the plans also provided unlimited tech support and a few other perks.

Still, a warranty -- even an extended one -- only covers manufacturers' defects in materials and workmanship. If your iPhone suddenly dies through no fault of your own, Apple's Limited Warranty will cover that for the first year. However, if you drop your iPhone on the pavement or send it through a spin cycle in your coat pocket, that's on you.

That's where AppleCare+ comes in. In addition to all the benefits of the original AppleCare plan, the ""Plus"" version adds insurance coverage for accidental damage. That's now the only version you can buy for most Apple products in most countries, and in the US, there's even an enhanced plan that includes Theft and Loss protection for an extra fee.

Over the years, AppleCare+ has become an even better deal. Initially, you paid for AppleCare+ for a maximum of two years for your iPhone (or three for a Mac), and received coverage for two incidents of accidental damage for the plan's lifetime. Break your iPhone a third time and you were left paying full repair costs.

A few years ago, Apple changed AppleCare+ to cover two incidents of accidental damage per year (within a 12-month period). It's probably no coincidence that this coincided with Apple's decision to let users continue paying for AppleCare+ almost indefinitely through a monthly subscription.

However, Apple sweetened the pot two years ago when it began offering unlimited repairs for accidental damage.

Of course, you have to keep paying for AppleCare+ to benefit from that, but Apple has also made that much easier for folks. Gone are the days when you had to add $200-300 upfront to the cost of your device. Now, you can sign up for monthly payments, similar to the protection plans that most carriers try to sell you.

To be clear, repairs for accidental damage under AppleCare+ aren't free. It's effectively an insurance plan, and like most insurance plans, there's a ""deductible"" involved. Still, that's an order of magnitude lower than the cost of repairs without an AppleCare+ plan.

For example, if you drop your iPhone 16 Pro Max and shatter the screen, the replacement will typically cost you $379. With AppleCare+, you'll pay only $29 instead.

Even when you factor in the cost of AppleCare+, the savings are still substantial. If you crack your screen even once in two years, AppleCare+ will have paid for itself since the two-year plan is $199 (or $240 over 24 monthly payments), and the repair cost is only $29. That's $228 or $269 versus $379.

Further, if you purchase AppleCare+ monthly, you can cancel it anytime, so your savings could be greater. You may decide that AppleCare+ isn't worth it after a year, but if you dropped your iPhone and had it fixed in that first year, you'll have paid less than half of what it would cost for a repair without AppleCare+.

Of course, like any insurance plan, Apple is effectively betting that most people will pay for AppleCare+ and never make a single claim. If you're someone who is extremely careful with your iPhone or you're willing to opt for a rugged case, then you may pay out a ton of money without ever making a single damage claim, in which case you've saved nothing. Still, accidents happen, and insurance plans provide peace of mind. AppleCare+ is no exception here.

On the other hand, if you tend to be clumsy or accident-prone, AppleCare+ could pay for itself in spades. Unlimited means unlimited, so if you crack your screen every week, you'll still be able to get it repaired for $29 each time. The folks at the local Genius Bar might get sick of seeing you and might even want to report you for iPhone abuse, but you'll still be covered.

AppleCare+ isn't just about accidental damage. There's still the extended warranty which will have you covered if your iPhone flakes out after the first year, plus Express Replacement Service that will ensure you won't have to live without your iPhone while it's being repaired. Apple will also replace your iPhone's battery for free if it retains less than 80% of its original capacity.

Apple offers a higher plan tier in several countries that will cover you even if your iPhone is stolen or lost. The standard AppleCare+ plans cover nearly any damage to your iPhone, but they won't help you replace an iPhone no longer in your possession.

AppleCare+ with Theft and Loss fills that gap. It's a bit more limited than accidental damage -- you'll only get two claims every 12 months, but let's hope you're not losing your iPhone or having it stolen even that often.

There are also a few more requirements involved. You obviously can't just call up Apple and claim you ""lost"" your iPhone and get a new one; you'll have to go through the process of filing a claim, which usually requires a police report. Find My also has to be enabled on the device at the time it was lost -- and left enabled through the claims process. Apple will eventually ask you to erase it, disable it, and transfer the ownership before issuing you a new device, but only after the company and its insurers have confirmed that it's indeed lost and not merely hiding somewhere in your house.

AppleCare+ with Theft and Loss costs $269 for two years or $13.49 monthly for an iPhone 16 Pro or iPhone 16 Pro Max or $219 and $11.49 for an iPhone 16. The deductible is a flat $149 regardless of the iPhone model being claimed.

The nature of the iPhone makes it the most likely candidate for an AppleCare+ plan, but you can buy Apple's extended coverage and insurance for nearly anything it sells -- even the Apple TV and HomePod.

Specifically, AppleCare+ is available for the iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, AirPods, Beats headphones, Apple TV, HomePod, Apple Studio Display, the Vision Pro, and more. As with the iPhone, these plans lower the repair costs for accidental damage to these devices. However, it's a tougher call as to how necessary an AppleCare+ plan is for a speaker or display that remains mostly stationary in your home or office.

For the Mac, AppleCare+ costs anywhere between $99 for a Mac mini to $499 for a Mac Pro for three years of coverage. While you can't pay for AppleCare+ monthly for a Mac, annual plans are available that you can sign up for up-front or use to extend coverage beyond the standard three years.

AppleCare+ for Mac will repair screen or enclosure damage for $99 or other out-of-warranty damage for $299. These flat rates apply whether you're toting an entry-level MacBook Air or the latest and greatest 16-inch MacBook Pro powered by an M4 Max chip.

AppleCare+ for the Apple Watch costs $79 upfront or $3.99/month for the standard Apple Watch Series 10 and older models in that series, $49 one-time or $2.49/month for the Apple Watch SE, and $99 or $4.99/month for either of the Apple Watch Ultra models.

Accessories like the Apple Pencil, Magic Keyboard, and Apple's USB SuperDrive are included in your Mac or iPad AppleCare+ plan as long as you purchased them with that Mac or iPad.

AppleCare+ for Headphones is available for $29 for nearly all of Apple's earbuds and headphones, including the entire Beats lineup. The AirPods Max are the outlier here at $59. Even an AppleCare+ plan for the new Beats Studio Pro, which are arguably a better option than the AirPods Max in almost every way, still costs $29. However, it's important to note that AppleCare+ for headphones only covers damage and battery replacement; if you lose one of your AirPods or Beats buds, you'll still have to pay the normal replacement costs.

AppleCare+ is also available for the Apple TV and HomePod. Although it's quite affordable, ranging from $15 for the HomePod mini to $39 for the full-sized HomePod, it might be challenging to justify for devices that you're likely to keep in one place in your home, as you probably won't ever need to utilize the accidental damage coverage. Nevertheless, it might be worth considering if you have a very active toddler running around.

You can also get AppleCare+ for the Vision Pro -- and you really should. After all, if you're already dropping $3,500+ on Apple's spatial computing headset, you'll want to protect your investment. While that's $699 upfront for two years of coverage, Apple also lets you do it via monthly payments for $34.99. The AppleCare+ replacement cost for accidental damage to your Vision Pro is only $399, which is a substantial discount over the $2,399 it might otherwise cost you to get it fixed. The Vision Pro is also a pretty specialized device, so don't expect your local independent repair shop to be able to help you with it.

If you're purchasing a new device for yourself, you can buy AppleCare+ during the checkout process at the Apple Store, and it's also offered in a similar way by big-box third-party retailers like Best Buy.

Of course, you probably won't get AppleCare+ on a device you received as a gift unless your benefactor is both generous and tech-savvy enough to know you need it.

The good news is that it's very easy to add to an iPhone, iPad, or Mac. Just go straight into the Settings app on an iPhone or iPad or System Preferences on a Mac, and you'll see a message telling you that it's available and an indication of how many days you have left to purchase it.

Tapping or clicking on this option will initiate the process of purchasing AppleCare+ using a credit card. Once the payment is processed, coverage will be activated immediately.

You can also buy AppleCare+ for certain other connected devices like an Apple Watch, AirPods, an Apple TV, or a HomePod directly from your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. For instance, an Apple Watch or a pair of AirPods will appear in your iPhone Settings app under General > AppleCare & Warranty. If they're still eligible, you can add coverage directly from there. You can also purchase AppleCare+ for other home devices like an Apple TV or a HomePod in macOS Sequoia by opening System Settings and selecting General > AppleCare & Warranty.

You can also visit Apple's Buy an AppleCare Plan website to purchase a plan for any eligible device associated with your Apple ID or even another device if you know the serial number. That latter option is useful if you want to buy AppleCare+ as a gift for a friend or family member.

Lastly, while you'll obviously need to have AppleCare+ to take advantage of the lower service fees, Apple does offer you a second chance to buy AppleCare+ after you've had your iPhone, iPad, or Mac serviced. It won't help you with those repairs, but at least you'll be covered if there's a next time.",iDrop News,https://www.idropnews.com/faq/should-i-buy-applecare-for-my-christmas-gift/232899/,2024-12-25,
"iOS 19 update: Supported devices, new features, and what's coming for iPhones","iOS 18.2 release brings these 5 powerful features for iPhone users

Apple is still in the process of rolling out the iOS 18 update, but attention is already shifting to the next major iOS release: iOS 19. New reports indicate that iOS 19 will likely be unveiled at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June 2025. Unlike previous updates, Apple plans to continue support for all iPhone models that run iOS 18, making the transition seamless for users of various iPhone generations.

According to the French website iPhoneSoft.fr, iOS 19 will be compatible with all iPhones that currently run iOS 18. This includes the iPhone 16 series, which consists of the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max. Users with iPhones from the iPhone 15 series (iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max) will also receive the update.

How to set up your new iPhone the right way,"The new iPhone setup process gets easier every year. Apple continuously improves the steps needed to set up an iPhone. These days, you only need to do a few things to transfer all your old iPhone data to a new one. Still, certain tips and tricks can smooth the way.

The hot new tip this year is that you can directly transfer data from your old iPhone to your new one using a cable. Plus, other time-honored iPhone setup tricks will help things run smoothly. Here's how to set up your new iPhone the right way.

This new iPhone setup guide attempts to cover all the bases. It starts with backing up your old iPhone, but obviously you can skip that if you're setting up your first iPhone or coming from an Android device.

If you're an Android switcher, you can copy your data using the Move to iOS app. And setting up a new iPhone from scratch isn't much harder -- you just need to go through a few extra steps.

Table of contents: New iPhone setup: How to do it the right way

Assuming you're coming from an existing iPhone, the first thing you want to do when you go to set up your new iPhone is to back up the old one. This will make transferring your data to the new iPhone a lot easier.

Backing up your old iPhone to iCloud before you start to your new iPhone setup will save you headaches down the line.

The easiest way to back up your iPhone is by using iCloud. Make sure your iPhone is connected to Wi-Fi and has more than 50% battery. Then do the following:

For more detail, check out how to back up your iPhone to iCloud, plus how to control what gets backed up to iCloud.

Your new iPhone will probably come with enough battery charge to get started out of the box. Turn it on by holding the power button on the right side. You'll see the option to set text size and accessibility settings for the setup process. Set the text to Default, Medium or Large and tap Continue.

If you're transferring from an Android phone, or if this is your first smartphone, tap Set Up Manually and continue. If you're coming from Android, you should download the Move to iOS app on your old device. Google's app will guide you through the process of moving contacts, photos and more to your iPhone.

The easiest way to set up a new iPhone is to use Apple's Quick Start feature, which quickly transfers settings and apps from your old iPhone to your new one.

If you're transferring from another iPhone, hold both devices next to each other and use Apple's Quick Start feature to get signed in and set up. They should automatically detect each other. (If not, make sure your old device is connected to the same Wi-Fi network with Bluetooth turned on.) It's easy, and fairly fast and painless.

Now your new iPhone will try to activate your cellular plan. If you have a compatible cell carrier, I recommend following on-screen instructions to transfer as an eSIM, so you don't need to fiddle around with paper clips moving the physical SIM card over. (In the United States, you won't have a choice: iPhones sold in the United States use eSIM exclusively and no longer come with SIM card slots. eSIMs are the way of the future. They are easy to manage, and you will never need to worry about thieves taking your SIM card out of a stolen phone.)

If you live in a country, or use a cell carrier, that doesn't support eSIM, you can use the tool included in your iPhone box to pop out the SIM card so you can move it to your new phone. Either way, your new iPhone will try to activate your phone plan. If you have problems with this step, you'll need to contact your carrier.

After this step, you'll need to choose whether you're setting up the new iPhone for yourself or for a child. Tap either Set Up for Myself or Set Up for a Child in My Family.

Like the new iPhone setup process, Face ID -- Apple's facial-recognition security feature -- becomes better every year. Newer iPhones can check your face with a mask on or with the phone sitting horizontally. So you definitely want to set up Face ID on your iPhone. To do so, point the camera at your head and look around in a circle, as if you're watching your best friend ride on a Ferris wheel all the way around.

When setting up Face ID, scan your face twice. It'll work better when you're wearing a mask or sunglasses.

If you put on sunglasses in the summer, or you wear a face mask often, you should have your iPhone scan your face a second time. This time, it'll capture more detail around your eyes. That way, Face ID can match your face using just the top half. Go through the same process again -- it only takes a few moments, and will pay off later on.

You have a few different choices for how to move your data over during the new iPhone setup process. If this is your first smartphone, just tap Don't Transfer Apps & Data and tap here to skip ahead in this tutorial.

If you're coming from an old iPhone, tap Transfer Directly from iPhone. This is hands-down the easiest way to move your data from an old iPhone to a new one. All you have to do is keep your old and new devices close to each other. Your old iPhone will beam all your apps, photos and data to your new phone. It works just like AirDrop.

The fastest way to transfer your data is to plug your new iPhone into your old one using a cable.

If you want the data transfer to go even faster, here's a pro tip: Connect the two iPhones with a cable. This wired connection will give you higher transfer speeds. Look around for a Lightning-to-USB-C or USB-C-to-USB-C cable, depending on which port your old iPhone comes with.

No matter which method you choose, you'll need to wait awhile as your data moves over. But it shouldn't take too long -- I transferred a friend's iPhone X to an iPhone 14 Pro while at dinner in a restaurant, and their new phone was ready to go before we got the bill.

If you're coming from an Android phone, download the Move to iOS app from Google Play. On your iPhone, tap Move Data from Android, tap Continue, and wait for the code to appear. Enter this code on your Android phone (once you open the app).

Your iPhone will create a temporary Wi-Fi network that your Android phone needs to connect to. Once your two phones connect, select the data you want to import and tap Continue.

The free Move to iOS app for Android doesn't copy over everything, but it will transfer contacts, calendars, messages, email accounts, photos and videos and some apps.

According to Apple, your phone will copy over ""contacts, message history, camera photos and videos, photo albums, files and folders, accessibility settings, display settings, web bookmarks, mail accounts, WhatsApp messages and media, and calendars."" Your iPhone also will automatically install any free apps available on both Android and iOS.

If you need help, check the page on Apple Support.

If your old iPhone has been lost, stolen, shattered, exploded or is otherwise no longer of this world, you can tap Restore from iCloud Backup on your new iPhone. This option will set up your new iPhone exactly like your old phone, but you'll need a reliable internet connection to download everything.

Don't try this at the Apple Store, where Wi-Fi connectivity can be spotty (especially around the time of a new iPhone launch).

Pick the latest backup you have and wait. Your phone will download all the essential data to restore it and continue with your new iPhone setup. After you finish, stay connected -- the iPhone will continue to download apps, messages and photos in the background.

The next step to set up your new iPhone is signing in with your Apple Account (formerly known as Apple ID). This will enable all the essential Apple services. Tap Forgot password or don't have an account? if you're not sure if you have one.

Make sure to turn on iMessage and FaceTime. Then enable Location Services, iCloud Keychain and Apple Pay. And don't skip setting up Siri.

Your new iPhone will ask you to turn on iMessage and FaceTime -- make sure you do that. Turn on Location Services so you can get local weather and location-tagged photos. You don't need to enable sending analytics to Apple but you can if you want.

If you plan to use Siri, don't skip setting up Hey Siri. I also recommend setting up Apple Pay if you have your credit and debit cards handy. However, you can always add these later in the Wallet app. Definitely turn on iCloud Keychain, the built-in secure password manager that syncs across all your devices in Apple's new Passwords app.

You can turn on Screen Time if you want to become more mindful of how much time you spend on your phone.

Finally, if you struggle to read small text, I recommend turning on Display Zoom to scale up everything on your iPhone's screen.

If this is your first iPhone, you might want some more guidance on getting comfortable after you're all set up.",Cult of Mac,https://www.cultofmac.com/how-to/new-iphone-setup,2024-12-24,
The iPhone in 2025: What to Expect Beyond the iPhone 17,"Expertise Apple | Samsung | Google | Smartphones | Smartwatches | Wearables | Fitness trackers

If the reports are true, 2025 could mark a few significant firsts for the iPhone.

Apple may release its first ""slim"" iPhone model, put its own 5G modems inside the iPhone for the first time and we may see the first iPhone SE with Face ID. Plus, we'll likely get a much closer look at Apple's AI plans for the iPhone, since the current wave of Apple Intelligence features feels like just the beginning.

There's a lot riding on Apple's plans for the iPhone in 2025. At a time when consumers are holding onto their phones for longer periods of time, it's harder than ever to entice iPhone users to upgrade. According to a CNET survey in partnership with YouGov, 44% of smartphone owners only buy a new phone when their current one needs replacing.

But with rumored new models like the iPhone 17 Slim and a redesigned cheaper iPhone, Apple could have an easier time exciting potential shoppers.

If it gets it right, that is. If Apple does release a significantly thinner iPhone, there's a chance that the extra-svelte design will come at a higher cost. And given the lukewarm reception Apple Intelligence has gotten so far, the pressure will be on Apple to impress consumers with new features next year.

Read more: Apple Watch Settings You Should Change for a Smoother Experience

While Samsung, Google and other Android phone makers offer screens that fold in half, Apple is sticking with the same traditional bar shape the iPhone has had since its inception. But the company is reportedly considering shaking up the iPhone's design in a different way: by making it significantly thinner.

Reports from The Information, Bloomberg and TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo indicate Apple may release a notably slimmer iPhone in 2025 instead of an iPhone 17 Plus.

The phone's sleek looks would be its main attraction; it would likely have similar specifications as the standard iPhone 17 otherwise but with a few compromises. For example, Kuo reports that this phone would have a single rear camera instead of the double camera found on the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus. It would also have the same processor as the base iPhone 17, according to the analyst.

The iPhone 17 Slim, if well received, could be just what Apple needs to get consumers excited about its non-Pro iPhones. That's to say, perhaps a snazzy redesign will coerce consumers to upgrade because they want to, not because they need to. Over the last two years, Apple's strategy has involved trickling features down from the Pro models, such as the Dynamic Island and the Action Button, to its standard iPhones to make them feel fresh and new compared to their predecessors.

But with the iPhone 17 Slim, Apple would be introducing an entirely new style of iPhone for the first time since 2022, back when it launched the first Plus. Still, that phone didn't feel as novel and original as the iPhone 17 Slim likely will. Instead of just changing the size of the screen, it sounds like Apple is rethinking the iPhone's design in a way that would make it feel more portable and premium than a regular iPhone, a value proposition that's not too different from that of a flip phone-style foldable phone. Flip phones, for example, stand out for their unconventional looks and more compact designs. If Apple were to release a sleeker iPhone, it would presumably check both of those boxes, too.

That said, there's a chance the iPhone 17 Slim will come with some tradeoffs, particularly around pricing since it could be more expensive than the Pro Max model, according to The Information. The phone's extreme thinness could also raise durability concerns, although it's impossible to know until Apple releases the product -- if it does at all. The device is said to be 6-millimeters thin, according to analyst Jeff Pu as MacRumors reported, which would make it notably sleeker than the 7.8mm iPhone 16.

Otherwise, the iPhone 17 lineup will likely come with fresh processors from Apple and screens with higher refresh rates across all four models (only the Pros have this feature currently), according to ETNews. All new iPhone models will also reportedly have a higher resolution 24-megapixel selfie camera, says analyst Jeff Pu per MacRumors.

The iPhone SE is expected to get a glow up. The fourth-generation of Apple's entry-level phone, which the company is expected to release in 2025, is said to have an edge-to-edge display like Apple's other iPhones, Face ID, the Action button, a 48-megapixel camera and Apple Intelligence, according to reports from MacRumors, Bloomberg and Kuo. That would represent a huge overhaul from the current model, released back in 2022, which looks like an iPhone 8 with the same chip as the iPhone 13.

Those changes alone could make the iPhone SE a compelling option for those looking to replace their current iPhone but don't need high-end specs like a smoother screen and additional camera. Android phones like the Google Pixel 8A have been leaving the iPhone SE in the dust in terms of design, screen size and camera capabilities, but it sounds like that could change with the next model.

There's another reason why the iPhone SE 4 could be particularly special: It may provide a peek at Apple's first cellular modem. Apple is reportedly developing its own modem, which is the component that enables phones to connect to cellular networks, to reduce its reliance on long term partner and rival Qualcomm, according to Bloomberg. The iPhone SE 4 will be the first Apple product with the modem when it launches next spring, the report says, before making its way to more premium devices.

Apple's first modem is said to be less capable than Qualcomm's; it won't, for example, support millimeter wave 5G, says Bloomberg. But the initiative would give Apple more control over its product development cycle, which could eventually result in new capabilities and better performance the same way its M-series chips have for the Mac.

Apple Intelligence, the company's first major push into consumer-facing AI, officially arrived in October, providing a glimpse into Apple's vision for how AI can make our phones more useful. But the first wave of features doesn't bring radical changes to the iPhone and neither did the second phase, which arrived in December.

Apple Intelligence, in its current form, primarily consists of assistive tools for tasks such as erasing objects from photos, rewriting text and getting tech help from Siri, along with the ability to create emojis and images based on a prompt. Siri also now has ChatGPT integration, and iPhone 16 owners can use the camera button to launch Visual Intelligence, which lets you learn about the world around you using the camera.

But next year, Apple will start laying the groundwork for what could be a larger shift in how we use our phones -- primarily thanks to Siri. Apple's virtual helper will be able to incorporate personal context into responses, take action within apps and understand what's on your phone's screen to assist with answering questions.

Read more: I'm Not Impressed With AI on Phones Yet. What It Will Take to Change My Mind

Those changes could make Siri a far more capable virtual assistant and could perhaps set the stage for a broader shift towards the iPhone's software becoming more intelligent. Apple indeed has larger plans to revamp Siri with more sophisticated large language models (i.e. the same tech that fuels ChatGPT), according to Bloomberg. This new Siri would be capable of answering questions more quickly and in a more natural manner, more similar to Google's Gemini and OpenAI's ChatGPT.

But that overhaul isn't expected to arrive until 2026 even if Apple announces it next year, the report says. If accurate, this would mean Apple's true answer to OpenAI and Google's chatbot would come to the market much later than its competitors, putting more pressure on Apple's technology to be successful. But Apple sees this as a long-term play and would rather wait until it's perfected its own unique approach rather than rushing to catch up, which is its modus operandi.

""We view it sort of like multitouch, which enabled the smartphone revolution and the modern tablet,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook said to Wired's Steven Levy in a recent interview when asked if he had considered charging for Apple Intelligence.

Rumblings of an iPhone that bends in half have circulated for years, but don't expect to see one anytime soon. Bloomberg reports that Apple is developing a foldable iPad and a bendable iPhone but notes that a foldable iPhone wouldn't arrive before 2026 at the earliest.

Android phone makers have looked to foldable designs as a means to reinvigorate the smartphone market amid stalling sales and longer upgrade cycles. But even though the market for foldable phones is expected to grow by 10.5% in 2024 according to the International Data Corporation, growth is slowing as phonemakers -- particularly those in China, where foldables are particularly popular -- are shifting their focus to generative AI.

Foldable phones can be beneficial for the right type of consumer, but their high prices make them hard to justify for most. Traditional phones are so ingrained in our lives that it's going to take a convincing argument to coerce shoppers into trying something new. The fact that Apple hasn't released a foldable phone yet -- and doesn't seem to be in a rush to do so -- suggests it may have the same perspective.

Until Apple publicly announces its new products, nothing is certain. But if the reports turn out to be true, 2025 will have much more in store than your average iPhone launch. Given that Apple has a reputation for showing consumers why new technologies are useful rather than being first, the expectations for new products like Apple Intelligence (and perhaps eventually a foldable iPhone) are particularly high.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/the-iphone-in-2025-what-to-expect-beyond-the-iphone-17/,2024-12-24,
Here Are the iPhones That Will Reportedly Be Able to Run iOS 19,"In an unusually early revelation, it seems that we already have a tip on which iPhones will be able to enjoy iOS 19 when it arrives next year -- and it looks like it's some pretty good news.

According to France's iPhoneSoft, no iPhone will be left behind when iOS 19 ships next year. That means iPhones as old as the 2018 iPhone XS and iPhone XR will still be able to receive updates to iOS 19.

iPhoneSoft has made similar predictions for past iOS releases, and while there has been an occasional misstep, its information has proven to be mostly accurate, thanks to ""a few friends within Apple.""

If this info turns out to be correct, Apple will set a new record next year for the longest-supported iPhone models, with the iPhone XS and iPhone XR bumping the 2015 iPhone 6s, which previously made it from iOS 9 all the way to iOS 15 before being dropped with the release of iOS 16 in 2022. The iPhone XS/XR were released with iOS 12, so they've already tied that record with this year's iOS 18 release; an iOS 19 update next year would put them in the lead.

Unlike its Android rivals, Apple doesn't traditionally say much about how long it will offer software updates. However, it has a proven track record of supporting most iPhones with 4-5 years of updates. That software lifecycle that was the envy of Android users for years; Google and Samsung have both recently raised the bar with a seven-year update promise for their flagship phones, but they're the exception.

In some ways, these longer runs of updates aren't all that surprising on iOS or Android. If anything, it was a testament to Apple's engineering prowess that the early iPhones could get through as many upgrades as they did. However, today's smartphones pack in such ridiculous amounts of processing power that it would be ridiculous if they couldn't receive updates for years.

In Apple's case, it's fair to say that the new generation of A-series chips began with the A12 Bionic in 2018. While the Neural Engine was first introduced in the 2017 A11 Bionic that powered the iPhone X and iPhone 8, that was a significantly weaker two-core version that was capped at a mere 600 billion operations per second. To put that in context, neural processing units (NPUs) like Apple's Neural Engine are typically rated in ""TOPS,"" or trillions of operations per second.

The A12 Bionic moved to an eight-core NPU that allowed it to hit a more respectable 5 TOPS, while the A13 Bionic increased that slightly to 5.5 TOPS in 2019. The Neural Engine cores then doubled in 2020, with the iPhone 12's A14 chip boasting 11 TOPS and the A16 reaching 17 TOPS. The A17 Pro and A18 chips used in the iPhone 15 Pro, iPad mini 7, and iPhone 16 lineup can now achieve 38 trillion operations per second, which is part of the reason why only those devices support Apple Intelligence (the other part is the requirement for at least 8GB of RAM, which is also exclusive to those devices).

The A11-equipped iPhone X and iPhone 8 were cut off at iOS 16, but they'd already been left out of new features even in iOS 15 due to their less powerful Neural Engines. By comparison, the iPhone XS/XR still support a surprising number of features in iOS 18. The few things that are excluded from these models are due to hardware other than the A-series chip.

For example, proximity unlocking with Home Keys requires an ultra-wideband chip that wasn't introduced until the iPhone 11, accessibility features like Eye Tracking require the improved TrueDepth camera introduced on the iPhone 12, and messaging via satellite requires satellite radios that didn't come until the iPhone 14. The one limitation that's likely related to the older A12 chip is audio transcription, which requires an A14 Bionic chip with its 16-core Neural Engine.

We'll likely see some more new features in iOS 19 that won't work with older iPhones, although that's likely to affect more than just the 2018 models. Apple Intelligence has already set a pretty high bar -- the iPhone 15 Pro or later -- so we don't expect any new AI features in iOS 19 to be available on even the 2023 iPhone 15.

Although Apple drew a line in the sand at the A12 Bionic with iOS 17, it's done a better job in supporting older iPad models. iPadOS 18 can still run on the seventh-generation iPad and 2017 iPad Pro models, which use the A10 Fusion and A10X Fusion, respectively.

However, according to iPhoneSoft, next year will mark the end of the line for those two, as Apple plans to cut off everything before the A12 Bionic for the iPad family. Since there were no iPads that used an A11 chip -- Apple went from the A10 chips in 2017 to the A12X for the 2018 iPad Pro and A12 for the 2019 iPad Air and iPad mini -- that only leaves out the 2017 and early 2018 models.

If true, the oldest iPad able to run iPadOS 19 will be the 2018 iPad Pro -- the first to receive the modern flat-edged design that's since come to the entire family. However, the more traditional 2019 and 2020 models will still be on the list.

While iPhoneSoft claims to have reliable sources, it's important to remember that this is all still rumor and speculation, so take it with the appropriate dose of your favorite seasoning. Even if the information accurately reflects Apple's intentions today, we're still in the early development stages for next year's software updates, so Apple's plans could change by the time iOS 19 and iPadOS 19 are ready.

iPhones with iOS 18 can upgrade to iOS 19; Full compatibility list revealed,"iOS 19 will maintain compatibility with all existing iPhone models. This information is attributed to a source within Apple.

Apple is reportedly working on iOS 19. According to the French website iPhoneSoft.fr, iOS 19 will maintain compatibility with all existing iPhone models. This information is attributed to a source within Apple. The report indicates that any iPhone capable of running iOS 18 will also support iOS 19, which includes the following models:

- iPhone 16

- iPhone 16 Plus

- iPhone 16 Pro

- iPhone 16 Pro Max

- iPhone 15

- iPhone 15 Plus

- iPhone 15 Pro

- iPhone 15 Pro Max

- iPhone 14

- iPhone 14 Plus

- iPhone 14 Pro

- iPhone 14 Pro Max

- iPhone 13

- iPhone 13 mini

- iPhone 13 Pro

- iPhone 13 Pro Max

- iPhone 12

- iPhone 12 mini

- iPhone 12 Pro

- iPhone 12 Pro Max

- iPhone 11

- iPhone 11 Pro

- iPhone 11 Pro Max

- iPhone XS

- iPhone XS Max

- iPhone XR

- iPhone SE (2nd generation or later)

The oldest models listed are the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR, all of which debuted in September 2018. However, it should be noted that certain features of iOS 19 may not be available on older iPhone models.

If the information in this report is correct, it would mark the second consecutive year in which Apple has maintained support for all iPhone models during its major annual iOS update. iOS 18 will be compatible with the same iPhone models as its predecessor, iOS 17. Notably, iOS 17 discontinued support for the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X.

In terms of iPadOS 19, there is somewhat less favorable news, as the report indicates that this update will no longer support the iPad 7 from 2019. However, it is reassuring that all other iPad models capable of running iPadOS 18 will remain compatible with iPadOS 19 in the following year.

The initial betas for iOS 19 and iPadOS 19 are anticipated to be unveiled during WWDC 2025 in June, with the official updates expected to roll out in September. While there have not been many rumors regarding features for iOS 19, it is anticipated that Siri will evolve to become more conversational, akin to ChatGPT, in a subsequent iOS 19.4 update, which is projected for release around March 2026.

苹果良心一次：iOS 19对老机型的支持力度友好,"据国外媒体最新报道，苹果公司已经着手准备下一代操作系统iOS 19的研发工作。值得注意的是，从目前的消息来看，iOS 19对老机型的支持力度依然非常友好，这一举措也赢得了不少用户的称赞，甚至有用户直呼苹果""良心""。

从曝光的支持名单中，我们可以看到iOS 19将支持包括iPhone XS、iPhone XS Max和iPhone XR在内的多款老机型，这些设备均于2018年9月发布。这意味着，如果这份报告准确无误，苹果将连续第二年在其主要的年度iOS版本中不放弃对任何iPhone机型的支持，上一次iOS 17放弃了对iPhone 8、iPhone 8 Plus和iPhone X的支持。

此外，对于iPad用户来说，明年所有可以运行iPadOS 18的iPad机型也都将兼容iPadOS 19。这无疑为iPad用户带来了更多的选择和便利。

据悉，首批iOS 19和iPadOS 19的测试版预计将在明年6月的WWDC 2025（苹果全球开发者大会）期间发布，而正式更新则很可能在9月推出。虽然目前关于iOS 19的具体功能传言并不多，但据推测，Siri将在稍后的iOS 19.4更新中迎来重大升级，变得像ChatGPT那样具备更强的对话能力，该更新预计将在2026年3月左右发布。

以下是iOS 19将支持的iPhone机型完整列表：

iPhone 16系列：iPhone 16、iPhone 16 Plus、iPhone 16 Pro、iPhone 16 Pro MaxiPhone 15系列：iPhone 15、iPhone 15 Plus、iPhone 15 Pro、iPhone 15 Pro MaxiPhone 14系列：iPhone 14、iPhone 14 Plus、iPhone 14 Pro、iPhone 14 Pro MaxiPhone 13系列：iPhone 13、iPhone 13 mini、iPhone 13 Pro、iPhone 13 Pro MaxiPhone 12系列：iPhone 12、iPhone 12 mini、iPhone 12 Pro、iPhone 12 Pro MaxiPhone 11系列：iPhone 11、iPhone 11 Pro、iPhone 11 Pro Max老机型：iPhone XS、iPhone XS Max、iPhone XRiPhone SE系列：iPhone SE（第二代或更高版本）

苹果此次对老机型的持续支持，无疑将为用户带来更加流畅和丰富的使用体验。我们期待在即将到来的WWDC 2025上，能够见证iOS 19的更多精彩功能和细节。

Leak reveals whether your iPhone will get the latest software updates,"READ MORE: The popular Apple products that will soon become OBSOLETE

A leak by an Apple insider has revealed which devices will be able to access the latest software updates - and it could be disappointing for some iPhone and iPad users.

The good news, according to a usually-reliable report from iPhoneSoft, is that any device which already has iOS 18 should be able to update to iOS 19 when it is unveiled next year.

That means anyone with an iPhone XS, iPhone XR or newer will still be able to access most of the new features alongside vital security updates.

Meanwhile, anybody still using an iPhone X and iPhone 8 will miss out as Apple drops support for these popular devices.

And even Apple fans with more recent devices might no longer have access to some of the most exciting developments.

Thanks to the huge computing demands of Apple Intelligence, Apple's AI software, iPhones older than the iPhone 15 Pro won't receive everything the update has to offer.

But it will be iPad users who are set for the biggest disappointment, as Apple pulls support for an extremely recent model.

According to the leak, the seventh-generation iPad won't be upgraded to iOS 19 despite only being released in 2019.

An Apple insider has revealed which Apple devices will be compatible with the latest software updates, and it could be bad news for some iPad users (stock image)

The iPhone XR (pictured) has already received software support for seven years but a leak it will also be compatible with iOS19 when it releases next year. Alongside the iPhone XS this will be the oldest devices compatible with the latest software

After Apple products are released, they typically only receive software updates for a set number of years.

In the past, iPhone models have been able to use the most recent version of iOS for up to seven years after they are discontinued.

However, Apple has been gradually increasing the number of years it continues to offer support, making it harder to predict when a product will be dropped.

Although Apple has remained cagey with the details, the tech giant is expected to release iOS 19 around September 2025 following the yearly Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).

According to this latest leak, the oldest iPhone model to be compatible with that update will now be the iPhone XS and XR, both released in 2018.

This shakes up earlier expert predictions which suggested that Apple wouldn't keep supporting these older devices with the latest software.

Tech analysts from CCS Insight previously told MailOnline they expected iOS 18 to be the last major update for these models, with support ending in 2025.

However, this leak does confirm expectations that the older iPhone X and iPhone 8, both released in 2017, would lose software support.

The leak says that every device currently compatible with iOS18 will be compatible with iOS19. However, Apple Intelligence features are likely to stay restricted to the iPhone15 Pro and newer (stock image)

What is an obsolete Apple product?

After Apple discontinues a product it loses support in two stages.

Five years on from discontinuation the product becomes vintage.

This means you can still get the device serviced by Apple but the company won't guarantee that there will be parts.

Seven years after discontinuation, the product becomes obsolete.

When this happens, Apple will not service or support the product.

Seven years after Apple discontinues a product it becomes officially regarded as obsolete which means that anyone still using these devices won't be able to get them serviced or repaired.

Having been discontinued in 2018, both the iPhone X and iPhone 8 are on schedule to become obsolete next year, making it very unlikely that Apple will continue to support these devices.

Similarly, this leak suggests that all iPads currently able to run iPadOS 18 will be compatible with iOS19, with the exception of the seventh-generation iPad.

This iPad model, which was released in 2019, was the last version to use Apple's A10 chip.

Due to the increased demands of new software features, it is believed that the minimum requirement to run iPadOS 19 is the A12 chip which wasn't featured in an iPad until the eighth generation model in 2020.

Luckily, this means that every other iPad model should be able to run the latest operating system.

With iOS18 still receiving regular updates, Apple hasn't hinted at much of what we can expect from iOS19.

If the company follows the same pattern as in previous years, we can expect to see developer previews of the software released in June 2025 with a public release to follow in September.

The seventh generation iPad is expected to loose software support next year, leaving users unable to access the latest features. This comes despite this model only being released in 2019

However, rumours already suggest that Apple might not have too many new features in store.

As reported by iPhoneSoft, one Apple insider claims they have 'not started the slightest feature for the next operating system, which is a first for him.'

Likewise, veteran Apple analyst Mark Gurman has suggested that overrunning work on iOS18 hasn't left enough time to get next year's software ready.

Writing on X, Mr Gurman said: 'I continue to hear that the gradual rollout of features across iOS 18 to iOS 18.4 is leading to delays of some features scheduled for iOS 19.

Read More Apple device is now OBSOLETE - and it will leave users without any support if something goes wrong

'That will lead to a long term rollout of features next cycle as well. Engineers are stuck working on iOS 18 projects when they'd usually already be on to the following OS.'

That certainly seems to be likely given that a number of iOS18's flagship features, such as on-screen awareness and personal context for Siri or personalised notifications on the lock screen, are still yet to be released.

But with almost a year until the expected launch of iOS19, it is still too early to predict what Apple could be preparing.

Apple has been contacted for comment.

苦等大半年，苹果iOS 19可算有了好消息,"从 6 月 11 日在苹果 WWDC24 中登场，到 7 月 16 日首个公测版上线，再到 9 月 17 日正式版发布......

满打满算，距离 iOS 18 初次亮相，已经过去了大半年的时间，然而时至今日，它被诸多用户视为""半成品""。

原因在于，苹果当初在发布会中展现的功能，至今未能全面上线。

而就在今天（12 月 22 日），根据 MacRumors 网站分析日志的最新数据，苹果似乎正在内部测试针对 iPhone 的 iOS 18.2.1 版本。

这个新版本，预计只是一次小版本更新，主要用于修复错误和 / 或解决安全漏洞。

""完全体 iOS 18""何时才能到来，是个未知数。

眼瞅着 iOS 18 的饼一直吃不上，许多 iPhone 用户把希望寄托在了 iOS 19 上。

在过去半年里，坊间确有 iOS 19 的爆料流出，但并非很积极。

不过同样在今天，外网消息源可算带来了 iOS 19 的好消息，关于设备兼容性信息。

到目前为止，iOS 19 都有哪些值得关注和期待的点，小编给IT之家家友们说说看。

01.传奇耐更王

根据 iPhoneSoft 提供的消息，苹果下一代操作系统更新的设备兼容性信息已提前泄露。

其中，外界最为关注的，是 iOS 19 的机型适配情况。

本以为，伴随着新系统的登场，苹果会淘汰一批老机型，但报道称，所有目前支持 iOS 18 的 iPhone 都将继续升级 iOS 19。

不过，有一些新功能会是较新 iPhone 的专属，老机型或不予支持。

倘若该消息源的说法无误，那就意味着 iOS 19 的兼容机型与 iOS 18 保持一致。

如此一来，最老支持 iOS 19 的机型，将会是 2018 年发布的 iPhone XS / XR。

考虑到 iOS 19 应当在 WWDC25 中推出，那届时这两个机型将服役 7 年。

还记得在去年 iOS 18 发布前，就有消息称 iOS 18 依然兼容 iPhone XR / XS，且最终当真如此，很多用户没想到年满 6 岁的手机还能接受到最新的 iOS 更新。

因此，倘若明年这两台""老家伙""还是能吃上更新的 iOS 19，那妥妥可以用""传奇耐更王""来形容了，硬生生比预期中多坚挺了两年。

而对于依然在使用 XR / XS 的用户来说，是一件好事，尚且没有被抛弃。

想必会有朋友好奇，为啥有 XS 却没有 XS Max，这或许是因为在 11 月中旬时，iPhone XS Max 被归类为""过时""。

说完新鲜出炉的好消息，接下来小编就要回顾关于 iOS 19 更早之前的信息了。

说起 iOS 19，其最早被挖出的时间点要追溯到 6 月 30 日。

当时，距离 iOS 18 亮相还没到 20 天，马克・古尔曼就透露苹果已经开始为 iOS 19 等系统做准备。

按照他的说法，iOS 19 的代号为""Luck""，中文意思为""好运""。

他表示，虽然谈及新系统还为时过早，但这是正常的时间表，苹果已经在开发明年的硬件产品，并且需要随附的软件来开始测试设备。

往后近 5 个月的时间里，就再也没有 iOS 19 的消息流出，直到 11 月 22 日，这份平静才被打破。

据外媒 cultofmac 报道，苹果正在开发一款由 AI 大模型驱动的对话式 Siri，允许用户使用自然语言进行多轮对话，该版本 Siri 据称受到谷歌 Gemini Live 和 ChatGPT 的语音模式所启发，有望于 iOS 19 中亮相。

紧接着该消息，在两天后，马克・古尔曼又带来了相似的信息。

他透露苹果将在明年 6 月 WWDC25 中公布的 iOS 19 中大幅强化 Siri，据称将让 Siri 在关键功能方面更类似 ChatGPT，允许其处理更复杂的请求。

自今年推出 Apple Intelligence 后，iOS 的更新重点基本就是围绕苹果牌 AI 展开。

在 iOS 19 中，苹果有望进一步强化其""苹果牌""AI 体验。

03.接着画饼

那么问题来了，既然继续丰富 AI 功能，为啥小编在开头会说""并非很积极""呢？

这是因为，紧跟这些爆料出现的，都是""画大饼""的消息。

就拿 iOS 19 会大幅加强 Siri 来说，马克・古尔曼是说了新版本的 Siri 将能够处理更复杂的请求，提高用户的交互体验，会在 WWDC25 中揭晓。

但他也说了，这一""大幅强化""的 Siri 实际上要到 2026 年春季才能推出，很可能将随着 iOS 19.4 一并亮相。

并且他还提到，最初计划在 iOS 19 发布时推出的""比平常更多的功能""，都推迟到 iOS 19.4。

以及在 12 月 12 日那天，马克・古尔曼又带来了 iOS 19 的""坏消息""，他表示：苹果分阶段发布 iOS 18 的策略导致了 iOS 19 的开发工作出现延误。

众所周知，在 iOS 18 中，苹果采用了分阶段推出的更新策略，将 Apple Intelligence 的功能逐步推送到受支持的设备上。

然而，这种通过各种小版本更新来扩展 iOS 18 功能的更新策略，已经对 iOS 19 的开发时间规划产生连锁反应。

他表示，工程师们被困在 iOS 18 上，而他们通常已经转向下一个操作系统。

从古尔曼的博文可以得知，尽管 iOS 19 会在 WWDC25 中如期亮相，但由于 iOS 18 的功能是逐步推出的，导致其功能也会被推迟。

如此一来，iOS 19 的新功能，也会延续分阶段上线的策略 -- -- 先画好一个大饼，然后再挨个实现。

04.iOS 19？iOS 12？

以上就是到目前为止，所有关于 iOS 19 的实质性信息，大致可以预见苹果会持续加码 AI，但何时能全部兑现，得一步一步来。

在我们IT之家报道 iOS 19 资讯的评论区中，广大家友们展开了热烈的讨论。

@SpectreAX 表示：iOS 19 估计和 iOS 12 一样，是对 iOS 18 的缝缝补补。现在的 iOS 18 太离谱了，有种当年 iOS 11 的感觉了。

@氡Rn 认为，今年 iOS 18 让他联想起 iOS 13 与 11，都是加了很多新功能，但是 Bug 满天飞。",凤凰网（凤凰新媒体）,https://tech.ifeng.com/c/8fWlEs49L3n,2024-12-22,
25 small and useful iOS 18 features you should give a try,"It's been a while since Apple released the latest software upgrade for supported iPhone models. However, the Cupertino giant is still not done adding new features to iOS 18 through consecutive point updates.

Apple recently released iOS 18.2, which brings several Apple Intelligence features such as Genmoji, Image Playground, and ChatGPT integration, enabling Siri to call its more capable AI friend when things go out of hand.

Overall, iOS 18 is a fairly big update from Apple that brings major design changes to several areas. For instance, the completely redesigned Control Center and customization options for the home screen. That said, some iOS 18 features might go unnoticed in the limelight of Apple Intelligence but could be handy at times. Here is a list of such small and useful features on iOS 18 you can't miss.

Note: These features are not arranged in any order of preference.

1. Hide app names, make icons bigger

iOS 18 lets you change the home screen look by hiding the app names below their icons. As a result, the home screen icons become a little bigger and easier to recognize.

To hide app names on the home screen, tap and hold in the empty space until the icons start shaking > Tap on Edit in the top-left corner > Customize. Now, tap the ""Large"" option to make the icons bigger and remove the app name.

You can read our detailed guide on how to customize the home screen on iOS 18.

2. Lock and hide apps

Speaking of hiding things, you can also hide apps from the home screen, App Library, and the Settings app. You can even lock the apps you want so no one can use them behind your back, even if they can access your device in an unlocked state.

You can lock and hide an app from the home screen and the App Library. Just tap and hold its icon > tap ""Require Face ID."" Read our guide for detailed steps to lock and hide your iPhone apps.

3. Find recently deleted reminders

If you use the iPhone Reminders app regularly, you can find your recently deleted reminders in a separate section. This helps in cases where you accidentally deleted a reminder or want to revisit something you removed in the past.

You can go to the ""Recently Deleted"" section under My Lists to see all the reminders you have deleted. You can tap on a recently deleted reminder to recover and edit it. The recovered reminder will move to the default list where it was initially saved.

4. Know if someone AirDropped your photos and videos

The Photos app on iOS 18 now has options that help you figure out if someone AirDropped photos and videos from your device. The Utilities collection includes albums called ""Recently Viewed"" and ""Recently Shared,"" where you can find the images and videos that were opened and shared by someone.

5. Delete very large video files

If you have thousands of photos and videos in your Photos library, there is a high chance that you might have several storage-consuming videos that you barely revisit. The Settings app on iOS 18 now lets you find such lengthy videos eating up your paid iCloud storage and delete them. We have created a detailed guide explaining how you can remove such videos.

6. Continue playing music while taking photos and videos

If your iPhone is connected to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, music will continue to play when you click pictures or record videos. This small but useful iOS 18 feature might be helpful at times, for instance, if you're the DJ at your home party and want to record the fun as well.

7. Share Wi-Fi passwords with Android users

Password sharing has been a feature on iPhones for a while, but it was limited to Apple devices only. iOS 18 makes another hole in Apple's walled garden by allowing users to share Wi-Fi passwords with Android users.

The new Passwords app in iOS 18 lets you share Wi-Fi passwords as QR codes. Android owners and other non-Apple users can scan the QR code to join the Wi-Fi network.

8. Search your call logs

One of the pain points of being an iPhone user was you couldn't search phone numbers in your call log. So, if you were to find who called you four days ago, it would be a tough game. The iOS 18 update brings a new search bar to the call log user interface, which you can find at the top of the screen. It appears in both the ""All"" and ""Missed"" tabs.

9. Schedule messages to send them later

Imagine you remembered your friend's birthday throughout the year but forgot it on the last day. Because you were too tired before midnight and dozed off. The Messages app now has the ability to schedule texts for a specific time so that such blunders rarely happen.

When composing a new message, tap on the ""+"" button, then select the ""Send Later"" option in the list. Next, you can schedule the date and time to send the message automatically.

10. New ""Apps"" page in the Settings app

The Settings app on iPhone used to offer a single scrollable UI where you need to dive into the clutter of apps and system settings. The iOS 18 update puts all the iPhone apps into one page called ""Apps"" (at the bottom of the Settings app) to reduce the clutter and make them easier to find. Of course, Apple isn't the first mover here, and Android has offered this comfort for years.

11. Easily manage your dual SIM setup

If you use multiple SIM cards on your iPhone, the Control Center now lets you manage them easily and switch between SIM cards like personal or business. Open the Control Centre > go to the Networks section > Press and hold Mobile data to get SIM card options. It would have been even better if Apple had added these options as buttons to the main UI of the Control Center.

12. Change lock screen controls

The wave of customization has also passed through the lock screen on iOS. Now, you can customize the two toggle buttons previously limited to Torch and Camera. You can replace them with multiple options present in the Controls gallery or remove them entirely for a minimalist look.

To swap the lock screen toggle buttons, tap and hold the lock screen until different options appear. Tap on Customize > Customize Current Wallpaper > tap on the desired control button once to remove it. You can tap that control button again to open the Controls gallery and choose your new option.

It is not just system apps; the Controls gallery also features options from third-party apps. For instance, you can pin Instagram or Snapchat directly to your lock screen.

13. Third-party apps in the Control Center

Apple revamped the Control Center entirely and now includes support for third-party apps. Following an update pushed by the automaker earlier this year, you can press a button in the Control Center to unlock your Tesla car, open its hood, or open the charging port.

If an app supports iOS 18 Control Center, you can find the options it offers by going to the Control Center gallery. To do so, tap on the ""+"" button in the top-left corner of the Control Center, then tap ""Add a control"" at the bottom.

14. Math Notes

The Notes app on iOS 18 now gives you one less reason to open the Calculator. It offers the Math Notes feature that solves math equations automatically. For instance, when you include the ""+"" operator between two numbers and type ""="" after them, the Notes app will display the total automatically.

It supports simple stuff such as addition, subtraction, and division but can also handle complex things like equations, graphs, and variables.

15. Hide screenshots, wallpaper suggestions, and Clean Up photos

The redesigned Photos app on iOS 18 offers several useful features. You can hide the screenshots from the main library to reduce clutter when scrolling through your pictures and videos. Tap the Sort button (double-arrow button) in the bottom left corner > View Options > select ""Screenshots"" from the list.

If you want to give your device a makeover, the Photos app can also suggest wallpapers. To do so, open the Photos app and scroll down to the section called ""Wallpaper Suggestions.""

Another thing you can do with the Photos app is remove unwanted objects from images using the Clean Up feature. The tool uses AI to get rid of distracting objects from your photos. However, it's a part of the Apple Intelligence suite and available on iPhone 15 Pro and later models. You can find the Clean Up option at the bottom of the screen while editing a image.

16. InSight in Apple TV app

Among various updates, the Apple TV app now includes InSight. When watching movies and TV shows on Apple TV+, it displays real-time information about the actors, characters, and music currently playing on the screen. The feature is similar to the X-Ray feature on Amazon Prime Video.

17. Safari Distraction Control

Our web browsing experience typically isn't complete without unwanted elements popping up out of nowhere. Safari tries to address this problem with a feature called Distraction Control. It lets you hide the elements you find distracting on a web page. You can quickly revert the changes whenever you want.

Go to the web page you want and tap on the page menu button present on the left side of the address bar. Next, tap on the ""Hide Distracting Items"" option.

18. Erase external drive

The Files app lets you erase an external drive connected to your iPhone. You can tap and hold the drive in the app and press ""Erase"" to get the job done. You can also format external drives to APFS, exFAT or MS-DOS (Fat32) file formats on your iPhone.

19. Vehicle Motion Cues

Vehicle Motion Cues is a new feature designed to help people inside moving vehicles. The feature claims to reduce motion sickness when using your iPhone in a moving car. It displays small moving dots on the screen, which change their speed and direction according to the movement of your vehicle. You can read our detailed guide to set up Vehicle Motion Cues.

20. Eye Tracking

Users who have trouble using iPhones with their hands can use the eye-tracking capabilities built into iOS 18. It relies on the Face ID camera hardware to track your eye movement and operate the device without touching it. Here's how to set up and use eye tracking on iOS 18.

21. Mirror iPhone on a Mac

iOS 18 lets you control your iPhone from a Mac by mirroring its screen wirelessly. You can interact with your iPhone apps from the big screen, get notifications, and even move images and documents across devices.

You need macOS 15 installed on your Mac to support the feature and the same Apple ID on both devices. Go to the launchpad on your Mac >, open the iPhone Mirroring app, and follow the steps. Note that the screen mirroring will pause when you use your device and resume when you lock it.

22. Control Contacts access for apps

A new privacy feature baked into iOS 18 lets you choose which contacts to share on a per-app basis. Go to the Settings app > Privacy & Security > Contacts. Here, you can decide whether a particular app should access only ten contacts while another app can access all of them.

23. Automatic language detection

The multilingual keyboard on iOS 18 can remember what languages you use across different conversations in messages and switch languages automatically. For instance, if you are talking to one friend in English and another in Hindi, the keyboard can save some taps for you.

24. Dark mode for icons

Some people have a special place in their hearts for the dark mode. iPhone has had a system-wide dark mode for years, but iOS 18 has brought home screen icons to the dark side. You can customize these icons to go dark or add a color tint in the shade you want.

Apple has also updated the home screen to allow more flexible icon placement. You can place the icons anywhere on the screen, and they will not move to the top like they did in the past.

25. More content types in Utilities

The Utilities collection in the Photos app now filters images and videos into more content types. You can find specific albums for images containing documents, receipts, handwriting, illustrations, and QR codes.

These are some useful features you can find in the iOS 18 update. Of course, more can be added to this list. If you think we missed something, drop your thoughts in the comments.",Neowin,https://www.neowin.net/guides/25-small-and-useful-ios-18-features-you-should-give-a-try/,2024-12-21,
iOS 18 Battery Drain Issues: Here's How to Fix,"The latest iOS 18 brings an array of useful features like call recording, the ability to hide apps, and more. The initial versions of any software update might be buggy, and the iOS 18 update is no different. Several people have reported battery drain on their iPhones after updating to iOS 18.

Moreover, some users have reported not only reduced battery life but also a decline in overall battery health. In this article, we'll discuss 7 ways to fix iOS 18 battery drain problems. Whether you feel your iPhone battery doesn't last longer after updating to iOS 18 or you're worried about the battery health of your iPhone, this guide will surely come in handy. Without any ado, let's begin!

First of all, just relax and don't worry too much. We're saying this because it's normal to notice abnormal battery drain on your iPhone after installing a major iOS update. That's because when you install a new install iOS update, your iPhone gets busy performing several background tasks that require extra power.

As a result, you might notice that your iPhone battery doesn't last as long as it used to after installing iOS 18. You need not worry as the battery life should return to its normal performance once these background tasks are completed. Just like your iPhone, it takes some time to complete post-update tasks and settle down, and it should then deliver the same battery experience as before.

Rebooting is an old-school yet effective way to fix iPhone battery drain problems. This helps you fix minor software bugs & glitches that might be interfering with your iPhone battery. Also, it will give the system a fresh start and improve your iPhone's overall functioning. So, if your iPhone battery is dying faster than usual after updating iOS, you should restart your iPhone before trying the other steps mentioned below.

To restart iPhones with Face ID, press and hold the Power button (side button) and either of the Volume buttons until you see the ""slide to power off"" option. Then, drag the slider to the right to turn off your iPhone. After 30 seconds, press & hold the Power Button until the Apple Logo appears on the screen.

If you're facing iOS 18 battery drain problems on a pretty old iPhone, you must check the battery health of your iPhone. This will give you deeper insights into the overall condition of the battery, and let you know if your iPhone needs a battery replacement. As lithium-ion batteries age, their charge-holding capacity also reduces. This leads to reduced peak performance and battery life. If your iPhone doesn't last long between charges, your iPhone battery might be due for a replacement. This is pretty common on older iPhone models.

To verify, go to Settings -> Battery -> Battery Health & Charging and check Maximum Capacity, your iPhone battery health. If the Maximum Capacity is more than 80%, you need not worry. However, if your iPhone's battery health falls below 80%, it indicates the battery is worn out and is due for a replacement.

If you wish to prolong the lifespan of the battery, here are 10 tips to maintain iPhone battery health.

If your iPhone battery health is good and you're still getting lesser battery runtime on your iPhone, you can adjust some settings to prolong the battery life. We've mentioned some battery-saving tips below. Let's check them out.

For complete details, you can visit our dedicated guide on how to save battery on an iPhone.

If you've tried the above steps and are stuck with battery drain problems, you must check for any incompatible, non-verified, or misbehaving apps that are consuming too much power on your iPhone. You might not realize it, but certain rogue apps could be consuming excessive resources on your device. This could be due to poor coding, infinite loop issues, incompatibility, etc.

To check for battery-draining apps on your iPhone, go to Settings > Battery, then scroll down to check the battery consumption by different apps. If you see an app consuming too much battery, you must first try to update it. In case this doesn't help, uninstall the app right away. Also, if an app that you aren't even using actively takes up one of the top spots, you must delete it right away as that app certainly is not good for your iPhone.

While we're talking about this, you should also try to recall if you've faced charging or overheating problems while using a specific app. If that's the case, try removing that app and see if it helps.

Sometimes, the battery drain problems might not be due to the iOS 18 update but rather older apps on your iPhone. Your device might have certain outdated apps that are compatible with the latest version of iOS. As a result, they trigger unexpected issues like battery drain, overheating, and more. When you install the latest iOS update, it's important to make sure that all your apps are up-to-date.

To update apps on your iPhone, head to the App Store, tap on your Profile icon, and browse through the list of available app updates. You can also turn on Automatic App Updates on your iPhone. For complete details, you can head to our dedicated guide on how to update apps on an iPhone.

If the above steps didn't work for you, all you can do is wait for Apple to address the issue and fix it with the next iOS 18 update. Apple generally releases software updates with bug fixes and new features. So, a future update should fix these battery-related problems. Besides, updates also come with security fixes that can safeguard your device against any vulnerabilities.

To make sure your iPhone is running the latest iOS 18 version, go to Settings -> General -> Software Update. If any updates are available, download and install them.

That's how you can fix iOS 18 battery drain problems on your iPhone. We hope this guide helped you figure out the exact reason for this and prolong the iPhone battery life. In case you've been stuck with battery-related issues for weeks now, we recommend heading to the nearest Apple Store to get your iPhone diagnosed for any internal damages or battery replacement.",Beebom,https://beebom.com/ios-18-battery-drain-issues-fixes/,2024-12-21,

OnePlus looks like it's hit another one out of the park with this year's OnePlus 13. The enthusiast brand's latest flagship launched in China in late October, and this week, the company officially announced it will be landing in North America on January 7, 2025. As one of the first mainstream phones to be powered by Qualcomm's bleeding-edge Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, it should bring significant improvements in the OnePlus 13's performance, battery life, and photographic prowess compared to its predecessor.

This also puts the OnePlus 13 first in line to challenge Apple's 2024 flagship. This year, the iPhone 16 Pro has raised the bar with Apple's A18 Pro chip that powers new Apple Intelligence features and turns the smartphone into a gaming powerhouse. There's also a clever new Camera Control and studio-quality cinematography features. Does Qualcomm's latest silicon give the OnePlus 13 enough of an edge, and has the smartphone maker put it to good use? Let's dig in and find out how these two measure up to each other.

Although the OnePlus 13 preserves the iconic design language of its predecessors, this year's entry modernizes things to match an aesthetic that's now become the norm among flagship smartphone makers: flat sides.

That's a departure from the rounded curves of the OnePlus 12 and prior models, but this new phone is still unmistakably a OnePlus device. It preserves the elegant circular camera bump that's become a hallmark of the lineup since its introduction on the OnePlus 11, but also refines it in some interesting ways.

For one, the camera ring now stands alone. Gone are the horizontal tangents connecting it to the phone's side, and the outer ring is considerably more subtle than before. The LED flash has been moved inside the camera bump, and the Hasselblad logo, which went from a full wordmark to a stylized ""H"" on last year's model, has been moved out to the edge, above a horizontal line that bisects the camera array. The OnePlus 12 was already a slick-looking smartphone, but the changes in the OnePlus 13 add a new level of class to the design.

OnePlus is also making two big changes to its colors this year, departing from last year's Flowy Emerald and years of green shades in favor of a new blue finish. That was released in China as ""Blue Moments,"" but it will be dubbed ""Midnight Ocean"" for the North American release. That's joined by ""Black Eclipse"" as the more typical neutral shade (known as ""Obsidian Secret Realm"" in China). However, we're getting the company's third color here this year, with the ordinarily China-exclusive ""White Dew Morning Dawn"" coming to the U.S. as ""Arctic Dawn.""

However, there's more to these than merely colors. Only Black Eclipse will sport the traditional OnePlus finish. Midnight Ocean will be coated in a micro-fiber vegan leather finish -- a first for OnePlus -- while the Arctic Dawn will use a special coating on the glass to give it a silky smooth finish. We'll have to wait and see what that last one means for grip and smudge resistance, but it sure sounds nice.

Compared to what OnePlus has done this year, the iPhone 16 Pro seems considerably more pedestrian. That's not to say it doesn't have a great design, but little has changed on the iPhone front in the past four years. Apple led the way in the move to flat edges with the iPhone 12, and this seems to be the year where everyone else is catching up to that design.

Apple switched from stainless steel to titanium for the iPhone 15 Pro lineup in 2023, which reduced the weight and smoothed the sides a bit, but it hasn't made the same kind of bold design choices that OnePlus has. Even the phone's colors have been relatively muted over the past two years, with the iPhone 16 Pro available in Natural Titanium, White Titanium, Black Titanium, and Desert Titanium. The first three are exactly what they sound like, while Desert Titanium leans more toward champagne than brown.

The OnePlus 13 retains the alert slider in its left-side position after moving it there on last year's model, while the iPhone 16 Pro similarly sticks with the Action button introduced on the iPhone 15 Pro and adds a new Camera Control button for quickly pulling up the camera and snapping pictures. Apple retains its standard IP68 dust and water resistance rating for immersion in up to 6 meters of water for up to 30 minutes, while OnePlus seriously upped its game this year by giving the OnePlus 13 both IP68 and IP69 ratings -- a significant improvement over the relatively weak IP65 of its predecessor.

For OnePlus, this IP68 rating means it can hold up in up to 1.5 meters of water for up to 30 minutes, so it's not rated to go as deep as the iPhone 16 Pro. However, the additional IP69 rating gives it more protection in another area, certifying the OnePlus 13 to handle high-pressure and high-temperature water jets. This means you could power-wash your phone if you wanted to -- though please don't.

With a classy look, unique finishes, and an IP69 rating, the OnePlus 13 is the clear winner for this round.

Winner: OnePlus 13

OnePlus 13 vs. iPhone 16 Pro: display

The OnePlus 13 display remains essentially the same as that of its predecessor. It's still a 6.8-inch LTPO OLED panel with a 3168 x 1440-pixel resolution and an adaptive refresh rate ranging from 1Hz to 120Hz. That works out to a pixel density of 510 pixels per inch.

The main change in this year's OnePlus 13 display is a slight increase in brightness -- 800 nits of typical brightness compared to 600 nits for the OnePlus 12. The peak brightness is still 4,500 nits, but that's more than enough for anyone.

Even though the specs remain the same, the switch to flat edges on the OnePlus 13 means the screen is also almost entirely flat, so you'll end up with slightly more of it facing you. There's technically a very subtle curve at the edges -- by definition, it's a 2.5D quad-curved screen -- but don't expect it to be anywhere near as curvy as the OnePlus 12.

Apple's iPhones never embraced curved screens, and the iPhone 16 Pro is no exception. This year's model has grown over its predecessor, but the new 6.3-inch display is still smaller than that of the OnePlus 13 (you'll have to go with the pricier iPhone 16 Pro Max to get something comparable in size) and offers a lower 2622 x 1206-pixel resolution at 460 ppi. That makes it slightly less crisp than OnePlus' larger screen, but it does get brighter during everyday use, with 1,000 nits of typical brightness. It can also drop to a single nit on the low end, making it ideal when you want to use it in a darker room without overpowering your eyeballs.

The iPhone 16 Pro maxes out at 2,000 nits of peak outdoor brightness, which is less than half of what the OnePlus 13 can do on paper, but it's hard to see this as much more than a spec sheet difference, as we've never had any problem seeing the iPhone 16 Pro even in direct sunlight.

The bottom line is that both phones offer bright and vivid displays, Full HDR and Dolby Vision support, fast 120Hz refresh rates for buttery smooth scrolling, gorgeous colors, and deep blacks. The primary differences come down to specs like peak brightness and pixel density, which most people won't notice, and while the OnePlus 13 is larger, size isn't everything; some folks prefer a more pocketable phone, so we're calling this one even.

Winner: Tie

OnePlus 13 vs. iPhone 16 Pro: performance

Over the past few years, top-of-the-line flagships have proven how much we've reached the point of diminishing returns in performance, and the OnePlus 13 and iPhone 16 Pro prove that even more this year. Both phones are powered by silicon with power far beyond what most folks will need, so the simple answer to which of the two performs better is that it won't matter as you're unlikely to push either to its limits.

The OnePlus 13 is one of the first mainstream phones on the market to be powered by Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 8 Elite mobile platform. Apple develops its own chips; this year, it's the latest A18 Pro inside the iPhone 16 Pro.

We've done a more detailed comparison of the Snapdragon 8 Elite versus the Apple A18 Pro for those who want to delve into the details, but the differences have more to do with the platform than the performance.

For instance, Apple has worked hard to court AAA game developers for the App Store. Last year's iPhone 15 Pro lineup, powered by the A17 Pro chip, ushered in an era of console-quality games in your pocket, from Resident Evil Village to Assassin's Creed Mirage. These played well on the A17 Pro chip thanks to Apple's new GPU technology with hardware-accelerated ray tracing and Metal effect upscaling, and they run even better on the A18 Pro.

However, Apple's coup here wasn't only in producing groundbreaking silicon, but in convincing game studios to embrace the iPhone. The Adreno GPUs in Qualcomm's high-end Snapdragon chips can easily compete head-to-head with Apple's A-series silicon, but you can't find the same quality of games in the Play Store to prove it.

That matters if you're a hardcore mobile gamer, the iPhone 16 Pro wins, not because it has more capable specs, but because it has better developer support. That's been Apple's advantage for years, so it's not too surprising.

Winner: iPhone 16 Pro

OnePlus 13 vs. iPhone 16 Pro: battery

For non-gamers, the more significant advantage to this year's chips comes not from raw performance, but from power efficiency. The new 3-nanometer (3nm) manufacturing process used by both Qualcomm and Apple should translate to longer run times between charges.

We'll have to wait and see what this means for the OnePlus 13, but the iPhone 16 Pro disappointed us by barely getting through a day of use. We expect the OnePlus 13 to do much better thanks to its 6,000mAh cell, and it's probably more fair to compare it to the larger iPhone 16 Pro Max, which we found has fantastic battery life, in this one area. Battery life is still the biggest price one pays for having a smaller phone.

Unsurprisingly, OnePlus continues to run circles around Apple -- and nearly everyone else -- when it comes to charging speeds. The OnePlus 13 supports wired charging speeds up to 100 watts and wireless charging up to 50W. You'll need to buy OnePlus' proprietary chargers to take advantage of these speeds, and if past trends continue, we'll probably ""only"" get 80W charging in the North American models, but that's several times faster than what the iPhone 16 Pro officially offers.

Apple's specs say you can recharge an iPhone 16 Pro to 50% in about 30 minutes using a 20W charger. Tests have revealed that a 30W charger shaves about five minutes off that. However, if last year's OnePlus 12 is anything to go by, 80W charging speeds should get you to 50% in 12 minutes and leave you fully charged in half an hour. Again, you need to use the SuperVOOC charger, but OnePlus includes one in the box.

For wireless charging, OnePlus supports standard 15W Qi charging or 50W charging if you opt for its AirVOOC charger. Those speeds are twice as fast as the iPhone 16 Pro, which can reach only 25W with Apple's proprietary MagSafe charger. You're stuck at 7.5W with a standard Qi charger, although the iPhone 16 Pro also supports Qi2 for magnetic attachment and 15W charging speeds -- something that most Android devices have sadly failed to embrace.

While it would have been nice to see Qi2 in the OnePlus 13, even for nothing more than the magnetic attachment features, that's a minor omission for a phone we can charge up in the time it takes to make a good coffee.

Winner: OnePlus 13

OnePlus 13 vs. iPhone 16 Pro: cameras

Thanks to its partnership with Hasselblad, OnePlus has delivered impressive cameras on its flagship phones over the past few years. The OnePlus 11 and OnePlus 12 take great photos, and there's no reason to believe the OnePlus 13 will be any different.

If anything, this year's model should see some improvements in the image pipeline thanks to the Snapdragon 8 Elite and its AI-powered image signal processor. OnePlus hasn't leaned into AI and computational photography the way its rivals have, but that doesn't mean it can't use what's already there. We'll have to wait and see what kind of photos the OnePlus 13 produces, but between the hardware and Hasselblad's color-tuning algorithms, we're very optimistic.

In terms of raw specs, you're getting a trio of 50-megapixel (MP) shooters, and while the telephoto lens drops from the 64MP of its predecessor, we think the new sensors OnePlus is using this year will make up for that. The telephoto camera has the same 3x optical zoom, although the ultrawide lens gains an increased 120-degree field of view. We expect the new sensors, combined with Qualcomm's latest ISP, to deliver better lowlight performance. OnePlus also seems to be taking advantage of the new 480 frames-per-second (fps) slow-motion video capabilities of the Snapdragon 8 Elite.

The iPhone 16 Pro is a much more known quantity. It follows Apple's typical playbook of providing three lenses with year-over-year sensor improvements. However, this time around, the ultrawide camera gets a boost to 48MP, and the iPhone 16 Pro gains the 5x optical zoom that was exclusive to the larger iPhone 15 Pro Max last year. While the ultrawide lens is the one you'll likely use the least often to take actual photos, Apple's computational photography engine collects data from that sensor, and more megapixels means more data for it to work with. The ultrawide lens also kicks in for macro shots, and there's a noticeable improvement there.

The iPhone 16 Pro also has a few more tricks up its sleeve. Apple's new Photographic Styles let you apply a broad collection of advanced filters to your photos, but the best part is that these are entirely nondestructive. In other words, you can switch them up later or remove them entirely if you don't like them. You can also shoot images in the Apple ProRAW format for advanced editing controls, and the built-in lidar Sensor lets you take depth-mapped night mode portraits. On the video side, the iPhone 16 Pro can also handle 4K Dolby Vision recording at 120 fps, which produces Cinematic Slow Motion playback when pulled down to 24 fps. Lossless ProRes, Log, and the Academy Color Encoding System (ACES) formats support professional work, and there's a four-mic studio array that powers a new AI-powered Audio Mix feature that can separate background and foreground audio (think of it as a portrait mode for sound).

Winner: iPhone 16 Pro

OnePlus 13 vs. iPhone 16 Pro: software and updates

The OnePlus 13 will ship globally with Android 15 and OxygenOS 15 layered on top (the China version uses Oppo's ColorOS). OxygenOS has been somewhat controversial over the years, but it's been steadily improving, and we've been pleasantly surprised by OxygenOS 15. It's turned out to be less of an iOS clone than Oppo's ColorOS 15, although it still veers closer to Apple's side of the fence. It still doesn't feel as smooth as other platforms, but it's definitely gotten better.

The iPhone 16 Pro comes with iOS 18 out of the box, which will be readily familiar to anyone who has used an iPhone in the past few years. As usual, iOS 18 refines the experience rather than rewriting it. This year's most significant addition is Apple Intelligence -- Apple's suite of AI tools. While these are rolling out gradually over the course of the iOS 18 life cycle, as of the most recent December iOS 18.2 update, there's built-in support for AI writing tools, image generation, and even direct integration with ChatGPT to help Siri answer questions it can't handle on its own.

As for updates, OnePlus is now committing to four major Android updates and five years of security updates, which should keep the OnePlus 13 current until at least 2028 or when Android 19 ships. Apple doesn't make such promises, but it's never really needed to as it has a proven track record; iPhones were getting four or even five years of software updates in the days when it was rare for most Android phones to see one or two. This makes it a safe bet that the iPhone 16 Pro will make it to at least iOS 22, and possibly even one or two releases beyond that.

Winner: Tie

OnePlus 13 vs. iPhone 16 Pro: special features

After holding out longer than most other big players, Apple and OnePlus are delving more into AI features this year. However, Apple is going all-in with Apple Intelligence while OnePlus is still taking a more measured approach focused predominantly on photography.

In OxygenOS 15, the OnePlus 13 gains a suite of AI photo-editing tools, including an AI Eraser, AI Detail Boost, AI Reflection Erase, and AI Unblur. These work much like you'd expect, although they have some work to do before they catch up with Google's Magic Eraser and Magic Editor. However, these aren't exclusively OnePlus 13 features; they're also coming to the OnePlus 12 in the OxygenOS 15 update. On the other hand, Google Gemini support and a new Intelligence Search feature will be limited to the OnePlus 13.

Apple Intelligence is a much bolder AI initiative overall. While the photo features are limited to a Magic Eraser-like Clean Up tool, the broader AI features include tools to help you compose and refine text, reply to emails, summarize audio recordings and call transcripts, generate images, and even create custom ""Genmoji."" Apple has also partnered with ChatGPT to integrate it into iOS. This includes letting you call it up to help you write emails and other blocks of text to making voice requests via Siri.

This also ties into the iPhone 16 Pro's marquee feature: the Camera Control. As the name suggests, this new button on the lower-right side of the iPhone can be used to call up the camera app, but it also doubles as a sophisticated control system thanks to a two-stage capacitive sensor. A light press will lock autofocus and autoexposure, similar to a DSLR; you then press all the way down to take the picture. You can also slide your finger along the control to adjust parameters such as zoom, exposure, shooting mode, and more.

Apple Intelligence comes into the picture through a new Visual Intelligence feature that lets you quickly perform Google Lens-like searches on real-world objects. Hold down the Camera Control and point your iPhone 16 Pro at something like an animal, a plant, a movie poster, a landmark, or even a product, and you can send it off to Google or ChatGPT to get more information about it. The concept isn't exactly novel, as there have been apps doing this for this for years, but having it built in and only a button press away makes it much more useful.

Winner: iPhone 16 Pro

OnePlus 13 vs. iPhone 16 Pro: price and availability

Following a typical first launch in China on October 31, the OnePlus 13 will be released globally on January 7, 2025. OnePlus has confirmed that we'll get the same three colors as the China version with different names: Midnight Ocean, Black Eclipse, and Arctic Dawn. There's no official word on pricing or storage capacities, but there's a good chance they'll be close to last year's OnePlus 12, which started at $800. The OnePlus 13 sells in three capacities in China: 256GB storage with 12GB of RAM, 512GB with 16GB, and 1TB with 24GB, but a November leak suggests we may not see the largest 1TB/24GB version stateside.

That would be in line with the OnePlus 12, which was sold in the same three capacities in China, with only the lower two available internationally. However, OnePlus could surprise us this year as it did with the color options. OnePlus' white finishes, such as the Glacial White OnePlus 12, have been primarily exclusive to China. Seeing a global launch of Arctic Dawn is a pretty big deal, which means the 1TB/24GB model may not be far behind.

The iPhone 16 Pro launched globally in September. Apple's smaller Pro model didn't get the storage bump many were hoping for; it still starts at $999 for 128GB, with 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB versions available for $1,099, $1,299, and $1,499, respectively. RAM is standard at 8GB across all capacities, and it's available in Desert Titanium, Natural Titanium, White Titanium, and Black Titanium.

OnePlus 13 vs. iPhone 16 Pro: verdict

Like many smartphone comparisons involving Apple, measuring the OnePlus 13 directly against the iPhone 16 Pro is tough. The two phones live in fundamentally different worlds, so it's an apples-to-oranges comparison (no pun intended).

For many folks, the decision between the OnePlus 13 and iPhone 16 Pro was made long ago based on the platform they've already invested in. However, if you're on the fence or looking for a change, these phones each offer something that might tempt you to see how the other side lives.

The iPhone 16 Pro is ahead of the pack with a more mature platform and an app ecosystem that takes full advantage of its gaming capabilities. The cameras take excellent pictures, the 5x zoom lets you get up close and personal, and the videography features are unrivaled. Apple's AI features aren't everyone's cup of tea, but they're well ahead of what OnePlus offers. Apple Intelligence is also complemented by the general fit and finish and smooth performance of iOS.

Nevertheless, the OnePlus 13 offers a gorgeous and elegant design that's even more refined than before, plus fun colors with unique finishes. If previous models are anything to go on, the Hasselblad-tuned camera system is sure to be excellent. The Snapdragon 8 Elite chip offers performance to spare with new photographic capabilities, and few smartphones can charge up as quickly as anything that OnePlus makes. OxygenOS 15 may not be quite as refined as we'd like yet, but there's a lot to like here and it's more ready for prime time than ever before.",Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/oneplus-13-vs-apple-iphone-16-pro/,2024-12-21,

The 7 Biggest Problems with Apple's iOS 18,"Apple's iOS 18 has a range of issues that uses think could be improved, the video below from HowToMen walks us through some of these issues on the iPhone, including things like multitasking, customization, settings and more.

iOS 18 falls short in delivering a seamless multitasking experience, which can be a significant drawback for users who rely on their devices for productivity. The absence of essential features like split-screen or floating window functionality restricts users from working efficiently across multiple apps simultaneously. This limitation becomes apparent in scenarios where users need to reference information from one app while working on another, such as viewing a document while browsing the web. The inability to have two apps visible side by side forces users to constantly switch between them, disrupting their workflow and hindering productivity.

Moreover, iOS 18's handling of background tasks, particularly downloads, can be frustrating. When users switch to another app, downloads often slow down or pause entirely, requiring them to keep the app in the foreground for optimal performance. This behavior not only interrupts the user's multitasking flow but also prolongs the time needed to complete downloads, especially for larger files.

While iOS 18 does offer picture-in-picture mode, its limited scope fails to address the broader multitasking needs of users. The feature is confined to video playback, leaving other scenarios, such as working with documents or messaging, unsupported. To truly enhance productivity, iOS 18 would benefit from a more comprehensive multitasking framework that allows users to interact with multiple apps simultaneously, regardless of the task at hand.

One of the most frustrating aspects of navigating iOS 18 is the lack of a consistent back gesture across all apps. The absence of a universal standard forces users to adapt to varying gestures depending on the app they are using or the context they are in. This inconsistency becomes particularly evident during one-handed use, where intuitive navigation is crucial for a smooth user experience.

In some apps, swiping from the left edge of the screen takes you back to the previous screen, while in others, it may open a sidebar menu or have no effect at all. This lack of predictability leads to confusion and frustration, as users are left guessing which gesture will work in each situation. The cognitive load of constantly adjusting to different navigation patterns disrupts the flow of interaction and detracts from the overall user experience.

To address this issue, iOS 18 would greatly benefit from implementing a standardized back gesture that works consistently across all apps. By establishing a universal convention, such as swiping from the left edge to go back, users would be able to navigate the operating system more intuitively and efficiently. This consistency would eliminate the need for trial and error, reducing frustration and enhancing the overall usability of iOS 18.

iOS 18 maintains Apple's strict control over third-party apps, which can significantly limit users' ability to personalize their devices and access advanced functionality. One notable restriction is the inability to set third-party apps as defaults for essential tasks like web browsing or email. Users are forced to use Apple's built-in apps, even if they prefer the features or interface of alternative options. This lack of choice hinders users from tailoring their device experience to their specific needs and preferences.

Managing app data and clearing the cache is another area where iOS 18 falls short. The absence of a universal option to handle these tasks within the app settings forces users to navigate through complex menus or resort to workarounds. This unnecessary complexity not only inconveniences users but also contributes to the accumulation of unnecessary data, potentially impacting device performance over time.

For users who seek to explore apps beyond the official App Store, iOS 18 presents significant challenges. Sideloading apps or accessing third-party app stores is a cumbersome process, often requiring users to navigate through complicated settings or use specialized tools. This restriction limits users' freedom to discover and use innovative apps that may not have gained approval for the App Store, stifling the potential for a more diverse and vibrant app ecosystem.

Developers also face constraints when creating apps for iOS 18. They are barred from accessing certain system features that could enhance app functionality and provide users with more advanced capabilities. This limitation not only hinders innovation but also prevents users from unlocking the full potential of their devices.

iOS 18's settings organization and design choices often leave users feeling perplexed and overwhelmed. One notable issue is the placement of app-specific settings within the system settings menu, rather than being easily accessible within the app itself. This unintuitive arrangement forces users to navigate through multiple layers of menus to find the desired settings, leading to frustration and wasted time.

The Control Center, while functional, suffers from a cluttered layout that bombards users with repetitive options. The lack of customization options exacerbates this problem, as users are unable to streamline the Control Center to their specific needs. This design choice not only hinders efficiency but also contributes to a sense of information overload.

Similarly, the Photos app in iOS 18 lacks robust organization tools, making it challenging for users to manage large libraries effectively. The absence of advanced sorting, filtering, and tagging options leaves users struggling to find specific photos or create meaningful albums. As a result, the app feels inadequate for users with extensive photo collections, hindering their ability to enjoy and use their memories to the fullest.

Customization options for the home screen remain minimal, restricting users' ability to personalize their device's layout and functionality. The limited control over folder organization, gesture customization, and overall aesthetics leaves users feeling constrained and unable to truly make their device their own.

While the iOS keyboard is generally reliable, it falls short in several key areas that impact typing efficiency and user experience. One of the most frustrating aspects is the autocorrect feature, which frequently makes incorrect changes to words, leading to errors and confusion in typed content. The lack of a robust learning algorithm means that users often have to manually correct the same mistakes repeatedly, disrupting their typing flow and slowing down productivity.

Another significant drawback of the iOS keyboard is the absence of a dedicated number row. Users are forced to switch between the main keyboard and the numeric keyboard whenever they need to input numbers or symbols, adding unnecessary steps to the typing process. This constant switching not only slows down data entry but also increases the likelihood of errors, especially when typing quickly.

iOS 18 also misses out on several advanced keyboard features that have become increasingly common on other platforms. The lack of built-in GIF search functionality limits users' ability to express themselves through animated images, a popular form of communication in modern messaging. Additionally, the absence of a clipboard history feature means that users cannot easily access previously copied items, forcing them to repeatedly switch between apps to retrieve information.

Furthermore, the iOS keyboard lacks a native translation option, which would be incredibly useful for users who communicate in multiple languages or encounter foreign text frequently. The need to rely on third-party apps for translation adds an extra layer of complexity and disrupts the seamless typing experience.

iOS 18 falls short in providing users with sufficient options to customize their device's interface and functionality to suit their individual preferences. The operating system offers minimal customization options, leaving users with limited control over the look and feel of their device.

One area where this limitation is particularly evident is in the customization of gestures. iOS 18 provides a predefined set of gestures for navigation and interaction, but users are unable to modify or create new gestures to streamline their workflow. This lack of flexibility can make the operating system feel rigid and unresponsive to individual needs, hindering users from optimizing their device experience.

Similarly, the functionality of hardware buttons, such as the power key or action button, is severely limited in iOS 18. Users are restricted from assigning custom actions or shortcuts to these buttons, which could greatly enhance productivity and convenience. The inability to tailor these buttons to specific tasks or apps leaves users feeling constrained and unable to fully leverage the hardware capabilities of their device.

The lack of customization options extends to the overall interface as well. iOS 18 provides minimal options for users to personalize the appearance of their device, such as changing icons, fonts, or color schemes. This limitation hinders users from expressing their individuality and creating a device experience that truly reflects their style and preferences.

When compared to other platforms that offer extensive customization options, iOS 18's constraints become even more apparent. Users who value the ability to tailor their device to their specific needs may find the operating system's rigidity frustrating and limiting.

While Apple's ecosystem is renowned for its seamless integration among its own devices, iOS 18 struggles with cross-platform compatibility, which can be a significant drawback for users who rely on interoperability with non-Apple devices and services.

One notable example of this limitation is FaceTime, Apple's video calling platform. When connecting with non-Apple devices, FaceTime often suffers from reduced quality and limited features. This inconsistency in performance can be frustrating for users who need to communicate with others who don't use Apple products, hindering the overall user experience and limiting the platform's usefulness in cross-platform scenarios.

File management is another area where iOS 18's cross-platform compatibility falls short. The operating system lacks the flexibility and ease of use needed for seamlessly transferring and organizing files across different platforms. Users often encounter challenges when attempting to share files with non-Apple devices or access files stored on cloud services other than iCloud. This limitation can be particularly problematic for users who collaborate with others using diverse platforms and need to efficiently exchange and manage files.

iOS 18 also exhibits limited support for non-Apple smartwatches and earbuds, effectively pushing users towards Apple-branded accessories. While some third-party accessories may function with iOS 18, they often lack the full range of features and integration that Apple's own products offer. This restriction can be frustrating for users who prefer alternative accessories or already own non-Apple devices, as they may feel locked into the Apple ecosystem to achieve optimal functionality.

Another area where iOS 18's cross-platform compatibility is lacking is in its implementation of RCS messaging. While RCS has the potential to become a universal messaging standard, iOS 18's support for it is incomplete, notably lacking end-to-end encryption. This limitation undermines the security and privacy benefits that RCS aims to provide, making it less attractive for users who prioritize secure communication across different platforms.

iOS 18, while maintaining Apple's commitment to stability and design, has several significant limitations that impact its overall user experience. From multitasking inefficiencies to restrictive customization options, these shortcomings highlight areas where the operating system could evolve to better meet the diverse needs of its users.

Addressing these limitations would enable iOS to become a more versatile and user-friendly operating system, empowering users to tailor their devices to their specific requirements and workflows. By embracing more flexible multitasking capabilities, consistent navigation gestures, and enhanced cross-platform compatibility, iOS 18 could unlock its full potential and provide users with a truly seamless and productive experience.

However, until these issues are addressed, users may find themselves constrained by the operating system's rigidity and lack of customization options. As competing platforms continue to offer more extensive features and flexibility, iOS 18's limitations serve as a reminder that even the most polished systems have room for growth and improvement.",Geeky Gadgets,https://www.geeky-gadgets.com/?p=446573,2024-12-20,

However, Apple quickly rebounded, celebrating successes in its services sector and forging a partnership⁢ with OpenAI to bring ChatGPT capabilities to new iPhones.

A bold ⁢Leap into Mixed Reality

Undeterred by early setbacks, Apple unveiled⁤ the highly anticipated Vision⁤ Pro headset at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). This ambitious foray into mixed reality signaled Apple's commitment to shaping the future of immersive experiences.

""2024 has been a ⁤year of notable highs and lows for Apple as it expanded into mixed reality and AI while navigating shifting consumer preferences and market dynamics,"" saeid Jacob Bourne,tech analyst at EMARKETER.The AI Revolution Arrives at Apple

Perhaps the most meaningful advancement of the year was Apple's entry into the generative AI market with the introduction of⁣ Apple ⁤Intelligence. This move positioned Apple as a key player in the rapidly evolving AI landscape, competing with industry giants like Google and Microsoft.

Navigating Antitrust Scrutiny

While innovating at a breakneck pace, Apple also faced increasing scrutiny from antitrust regulators in the US and Europe. Concerns about the company's market dominance and potential anti-competitive practices continued to loom large.Looking Ahead

Despite the challenges, 2024 proved ⁢to be⁢ a year ⁢of significant progress for Apple. the company solidified⁢ its position as a⁣ leader in technology and innovation, while also demonstrating its willingness ⁤to adapt and evolve⁤ in a rapidly changing world. As Apple looks ahead to 2025, the question remains: can it maintain this momentum ⁤while navigating the complex regulatory and competitive ⁢landscape?

Apple CEO Tim Cook remains optimistic about the tech giant's prospects in China, despite a challenging year marked by sluggish iPhone sales and fierce competition. While Apple's⁤ overall revenue exceeded expectations in its fiscal fourth quarter,sales in Greater China dipped year-over-year,underscoring the ongoing struggles in a crucial market.

Analysts have described sales of the iPhone 15 in China as ""lackluster,"" as domestic rivals like Huawei and Xiaomi gain ground in the competitive⁣ smartphone market. This trend has been a recurring theme throughout 2024, casting a shadow over Apple's performance in the region.

despite the challenges, Cook emphasized ""positive signs"" during Apple's fiscal Q4 earnings call ⁣on October 31. He highlighted his frequent visits to china this year - at least⁤ three as of November - underscoring the importance of the market for Apple. These trips come amid concerns over the potential impact of trade tensions and tariffs, especially those threatened by former President Donald Trump, on ⁣Apple's supply chain, which heavily relies on chinese manufacturing.

The CEO's optimism suggests that Apple is actively working to navigate the complexities of the Chinese market and regain its footing. Whether these ""positive signs""⁣ will translate⁢ into a significant turnaround in sales remains to be seen.

Apple's highly anticipated Vision Pro headset, unveiled in February, has reportedly fallen short of ⁢sales expectations, leaving analysts and ⁢industry watchers scratching their heads.

""It's a disappointment in '24,⁤ full stop,"" gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said.

the $3,499 price tag, coupled with concerns about the headset's bulky design and limited real-world applications, might potentially be contributing to the lukewarm reception.

While Apple has remained tight-lipped about specific sales figures, industry analysts have suggested that demand for the Vision Pro has been considerably lower than anticipated. Some speculate that the high cost and uncertain market for augmented and virtual reality technology are deterring potential buyers.

The Vision Pro's launch comes at a time when the⁤ tech industry is grappling with ⁢slowing growth and⁤ increased competition. Whether Apple can overcome these⁤ challenges and turn the Vision Pro into a mainstream success⁣ remains to be seen.

Cupertino, ⁣CA ⁤- Apple ⁢CEO Tim Cook has acknowledged that the company's groundbreaking Vision Pro headset, priced at a hefty $3,500, is not intended for the mainstream market.In a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal, Cook characterized the mixed reality device as a product for ⁢""people who want to have tomorrow's technology today.""

The vision Pro, launched in February, has generated considerable buzz but also faced scrutiny for its high price tag and limited applications.⁢ While Apple touted its potential for both gaming and professional use, the headset's target audience remained unclear.

Cook's candid admission confirms that the Vision Pro is currently aimed at a niche market of tech enthusiasts and ⁢early adopters willing to invest in cutting-edge technology. ""At ⁤$3,500,it's not a mass-market product,"" Cook stated.""Right now, it's an early-adopter product.""

This statement comes amidst reports that Apple is scaling back production of the Vision Pro due to weaker-than-expected demand. The tech giant is reportedly exploring the development of a more affordable version of the headset to broaden its⁣ appeal.

Tech giant Apple is⁤ facing a crucial legal battle that coudl reshape the smartphone landscape, even as it unveils its latest iPad⁤ lineup.

In March, the U.S. department of Justice (DOJ) filed a high-profile antitrust lawsuit against Apple, accusing the company of wielding an illegal monopoly over the smartphone market. The ⁢DOJ alleges that Apple engaged in anti-competitive practices, ""delaying, degrading, or outright blocking""⁣ rival technologies to maintain its dominance.

Apple vehemently denies these allegations, arguing that the DOJ's case relies ⁤on speculation. The company filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit in August, asserting that its actions have benefited consumers and fostered innovation.

The fate of the lawsuit now rests⁢ in the hands of U.S.District Court Judge Julien Xavier ⁤Neals. A decision on whether the case will proceed to trial could come as early as January, according to Bloomberg.

Meanwhile,⁢ Apple continues to push⁢ forward with new⁤ product launches.

This week, the company unveiled its ⁣latest generation of iPads, featuring upgraded processors,⁣ improved cameras, and enhanced displays. The new iPads aim to solidify Apple's position in the⁢ tablet ⁢market, where it faces stiff competition from rivals like Samsung and Microsoft.

The⁣ outcome of the ⁤DOJ lawsuit could ⁤have significant implications for Apple's future business practices.⁢ If the government prevails,⁤ Apple could be forced ⁤to make ample changes to its App ⁢Store policies ⁣and⁤ other aspects of its business model.

This legal ⁤battle comes at a time of heightened scrutiny of Big Tech ⁣companies and their market power. ⁣The DOJ's⁢ lawsuit against Apple is part⁢ of a broader effort by regulators⁤ to rein in the influence of tech giants and promote⁢ competition in the digital economy.

the coming months will be crucial for Apple as it navigates this legal challenge⁤ while continuing to innovate and compete in a rapidly⁢ evolving tech landscape.

Apple's latest iPad Pro models, boasting groundbreaking OLED displays, stole the show at the company's ""Let Loose"" event in May, even as the tech world⁣ buzzed with anticipation for major AI announcements from rivals like ⁤OpenAI ⁣and Google.

While Apple CEO Tim Cook hailed the event as ""the biggest⁢ day for iPad since its introduction,"" the⁢ launch came amidst a flurry of activity in the AI space.

The new iPad Pros, though, are a testament to Apple's continued commitment to its tablet lineup. Cook⁤ emphasized the significance of the upgrade, stating, ""This is a game-changer for iPad.""

Despite the AI frenzy, iPads⁤ proved to be a strong performer for Apple in the third quarter.

Apple Intelligence Arrives at WWDC

The tech giant finally unveiled its own AI assistant, Apple Intelligence,⁣ at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June. This move signaled Apple's entry into the increasingly competitive AI landscape.

The integration of Apple Intelligence into the iPad ecosystem could further enhance the tablet's capabilities, potentially blurring the lines between traditional computing and AI-powered experiences.

Apple's foray into the world of artificial intelligence, Apple Intelligence, quietly debuted at the annual worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June, marking a significant move in⁣ the ongoing AI arms race.

While the tech giant didn't make a splashy announcement, the unveiling of Apple ⁣Intelligence signaled a strategic shift for the company. As OpenAI's ChatGPT ⁢took the world by storm in 2022,the race to develop ⁣and⁤ deploy ⁢powerful AI tools has intensified.

Apple Intelligence, integrated⁤ into the latest iOS and macOS updates, offers a suite of AI-powered features designed to enhance user experience. From smarter ⁣Siri interactions to more intuitive app suggestions, Apple is⁤ weaving AI into the fabric of its ecosystem.

The company's approach, however, appears ⁢to be one of cautious integration. Unlike some competitors who have released standalone AI chatbots, Apple is focusing on embedding AI capabilities within⁣ existing products and services. ⁣This measured⁤ approach reflects apple's long-standing commitment to user ⁤privacy and data security.

The long-term impact of⁣ Apple Intelligence remains to be seen. However, its ⁤arrival signals a new chapter in Apple's evolution, one where ⁣artificial intelligence plays a central role ⁢in shaping the future of its products and services.

Apple's foray into artificial intelligence, Apple Intelligence, generated massive buzz when it was announced last year. But a year later, is it living up to the⁣ lofty expectations?

The tech world erupted when Apple unveiled Apple Intelligence at its annual ⁣Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). Analysts hailed⁢ it as a game-changer, predicting a ""golden upgrade cycle"" for iPhones.

""Apple Intelligence was the biggest story of the year,"" declared William Kerwin, a technology analyst at Morningstar.

The initial rollout in ⁤October 2024 saw Apple Intelligence integrated into iOS 18, but only available on iPhone 15 Pro models and newer.

Early features included ""writing Tools,""⁣ AI-generated emojis, ⁢and ChatGPT accessibility through⁣ Siri.⁢ While these additions ⁤were welcomed, some critics pointed out that Apple was playing catch-up in the AI race, dominated by giants like Google and OpenAI.

""They ⁤caught up by partnering and by adding AI ⁣to something only Apple⁣ can do,"" observed analyst Gene Munster.

Expanding Horizons: China and Beyond

Apple is reportedly exploring ways to bring Apple Intelligence to its massive Chinese⁣ user base. However, navigating China's regulatory landscape will require partnerships with local⁤ companies.

The ⁤Future of Apple intelligence

While not all initially promised features have launched, Apple has committed to ongoing development and expansion of Apple Intelligence throughout 2025. The company's ⁢focus on integrating AI seamlessly into its ecosystem,combined with its commitment to user privacy,could position Apple Intelligence as a major player in the evolving AI landscape.

Only time will tell if Apple Intelligence will truly revolutionize the iPhone experience, but one thing is certain: the journey has just begun.

Cupertino, CA - Apple's highly anticipated ""Glowtime"" event in September unveiled ⁣the iPhone 16, a device the company⁣ touted as ⁢""built from the ground up to deliver Apple Intelligence."" While the initial release ⁤lacked the fully integrated AI⁤ experience, a later iOS update brought the promised functionality, marking a significant step in ⁤Apple's foray into artificial intelligence.

The iPhone 16 arrived amidst slowing iPhone⁣ sales, leading many to hope the AI-powered device would reignite⁢ consumer⁣ interest. Along with the ⁢new camera control button and software updates, the iPhone 16 Pro starts at $999, while the Pro Max model is priced at $1,199.

While a significant sales surge hasn't materialized yet, ⁣analysts remain optimistic about the iPhone 16's long-term impact. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives predicts a ""multi-year supercycle"" ⁣for Apple, driven by the integration of AI into its products.

""We believe iPhone 16 has kicked off a multi-year supercycle for Apple as the⁣ AI Revolution comes to the consumer,"" Ives stated in a recent analyst⁢ note.

Interestingly, Apple's 2024 product lineup also saw the cancellation of several projects that were reportedly ⁣in development. The tech giant has remained tight-lipped about the reasons behind these decisions, ⁣fueling speculation among industry observers.

Tech giant Apple has abandoned its own ""Buy Now, Pay Later"" (BNPL) service, Apple Pay Later,⁤ opting instead to partner with Swedish fintech company Klarna to⁤ bring BNPL functionality to Apple Pay. This strategic ⁣shift, first reported by The Verge,⁣ signals a change in Apple's⁣ approach to the burgeoning BNPL market.

The move comes after Apple Pay Later faced delays and regulatory scrutiny. By partnering with Klarna, a well-established player in the BNPL space,⁢ Apple can leverage Klarna's existing infrastructure ⁢and expertise, potentially accelerating the rollout of BNPL features within apple Pay.

For consumers, this⁣ partnership could mean a more seamless BNPL experience within the familiar Apple Pay ecosystem. Users⁣ might potentially be able to ⁢access Klarna's BNPL⁤ options directly through Apple Pay,simplifying the checkout process⁢ for online and in-store purchases.

The decision to discontinue Apple Pay Later also reflects a broader trend⁢ in the tech industry,with companies increasingly focusing on partnerships and collaborations to expand their offerings ⁣and reach new markets.

While Apple has not officially commented on the reasons behind the shift, analysts suggest that partnering with Klarna allows⁣ Apple to focus on its core strengths, such as hardware and software development,⁤ while still providing users with access to popular financial services.

Across the U.S.,homeowners are embracing a downsized lifestyle,adding compact dwellings to their ⁣properties.

The American Dream has long⁣ been synonymous with sprawling suburban homes, but a new trend is taking root: ⁢tiny homes. these compact dwellings, frequently enough under 400 square feet, are popping up in backyards across the country, offering ⁣homeowners a unique blend of affordability, sustainability, and flexibility.

""It's about simplifying life,"" says Sarah⁣ Miller, a Denver resident who recently added a tiny home to⁢ her property. ""We⁢ wanted a space for guests, a home office, and a way to reduce our environmental footprint, all in one.""

The appeal of tiny homes is multifaceted. ⁢For some, it's a financial solution, allowing them to⁢ downsize their living expenses or create additional income through rentals. Others are drawn to ⁣the minimalist lifestyle,⁢ embracing a smaller⁢ footprint and focusing on experiences over possessions.

""We were tired of the constant upkeep of our large house,"" explains John Davis, who built a tiny home in his backyard in Austin, Texas. ""Now we have more time and money to travel and pursue our hobbies.""

The rise of tiny homes also reflects a growing awareness of environmental sustainability. These compact dwellings frequently enough utilize energy-efficient appliances, solar ⁢panels, and lasting building materials, ⁢minimizing their ⁢impact on⁣ the planet.

While ⁢zoning⁢ regulations and homeowner association rules can pose challenges, the tiny home movement is gaining momentum. Communities⁣ are adapting, recognizing ⁤the benefits of these ⁣innovative living spaces.

""Tiny homes offer a creative solution ⁤to housing affordability and promote sustainable living,"" says urban planner Emily Chen.""As more people embrace this trend, we'll likely see more communities embrace flexible⁤ zoning ⁤regulations to accommodate them.""

The⁤ tiny home movement is⁤ more than just a trend; it's a reflection of ⁤evolving values and a desire for a simpler, more intentional way of life. As Americans continue to ⁣seek ⁣alternatives to traditional housing, the tiny home revolution is poised to grow, transforming backyards and redefining the American Dream.

11 iOS 18.2 features to try first on your iPhone that aren't Apple Intelligence,"Apple Intelligence is definitely the headliner when it comes to iOS 18.2, the most recent update to Apple's iPhone software. But the list of new features doesn't end with Image Playground, Genmoji and any of the other AI-powered tools that iOS 18.2 brings to the table.

And that's good news for most iPhone owners who either haven't upgraded to the latest iPhone 16 models or own an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max. Those are the only iPhones that can run Apple Intelligence, making additional AI capabilities irrelevant to other iPhone owners. In contrast, nearly all of the remaining iOS 18.2 improvements benefit any iPhone that supports the iOS 18 update -- which includes devices dating back to the iPhone XR and XS models released in 2018. (For the record, there are a few iPhone 16-specific features in iOS 18.2, which we talk about later.)

We've detailed all the currently available Apple Intelligence features brought about the iOS 18.2 update this month as well as the iOS 18.1 release at the end of October. Here's a look at the rest of the iOS 18.2 improvements and additions aimed at your iPhone.

Outside of Apple Intelligence, Photos probably sees the biggest batch of changes in iOS 18.2, with the most significant ones giving you expanded control over how to customize the redesigned photos app. I've shown you how to use many of the new iOS 18.2 features in Photos, including deleting images from the Recently Viewed and Recently Shared folders, turning off auto-looping on video playback and re-ordering your albums so that they're listed in alphabetical order.

But there are some other changes to be aware of, too, starting with video playback. It's now full-screen in iOS 18.2 -- previously, you had to tap on the video as it played to switch to full screen mode. You can also now scrub frame-by-frame when watching videos by pressing and holding on the slider, before dragging it back and forth.

There are a few other cosmetic changes to Photos in iOS 18.2. An album of Favorites now appears in the Utilities section. When looking at Collections, swiping right now takes you back to the previous view.

We've covered the changes to Mail in iOS 18.2, but just to be thorough, iOS 18.2 introduces a new organizational layout, where your inbox is split into different categories. Besides Primary, you get a Transactions inbox that houses receipts; Updates, which features newsletters and other notifications; and Promotions, which is where various e-commerce and sales promos will appear.

I'm not necessarily a fan of the new look in iOS 18.2 Mail, primarily because it's hard to tell when new mail has arrived in the different folders. Managing older emails from the same sender is also more difficult than it needs to be. If you feel the same way -- or if you don't like the look of iOS 18.2 Mail for any other reason, just tap the More button in the upper right corner. (It's the one with three dots.) That summons up the option of reverting to the familiar list view featuring a single inbox.

Here's another reason to explore the More pop-up menu: in the shipping version of iOS 18.2, it's added an option to disable Group by Sender. Tap that option and emails from the same source are no longer bunched together, addressing my complaint that it's too difficult to delete individual messages while keeping the ones that are still relevant to you.

Besides some security improvements -- URLs are now upgraded to HTTPS wherever possible, and Apple's browser now warns you when a website doesn't have a valid SSL certificate for an encrypted connection -- Safari makes a few house-cleaning changes. You'll see new options for your start page background images. (Hit Edit at the bottom of the start page to find them.) Import and Export controls let you move browsing data between Safari and other browsers.

Download a file in Safari, and you can now chart the progress of the download in the Dynamic Island area of your iPhone if your handset offers that feature. The feature appears as a circle that fills in, much like an AirDrop transfer, but if your Safari downloads are as speedy as mine, the download indicator will likely appear and disappear before you even notice it.

As part of Apple Intelligence, the Photos app supports natural language searches -- a capability that's even supported by older iPhones based on my iOS 18 testing. The same thing now goes for searches in the Music and TV apps. You can type things like ""Coen Brothers movies from the 1990s"" and the TV app will bring ""Fargo"" and ""Barton Fink"" to the top of your results list.

As for Apple's Podcasts app, it now invites you to designate your favorite genres -- doing so will apparently influence recommendations the app makes on podcasts you should listen to. I'm guessing it also has an impact on another change from iOS 18.2 that promises a ""personalized serach page,"" where Podcasts will highlight the most relevant categories and collections based on your interests.

I'm told musicians like to use the Voice Memos apps as way to try out music and lyrics they might be working on, and it sounds like there's a change in the Voice Memos app that will appeal directly to that use case. As of iOS 18.2, the app supports layered recordings, where you can add a vocal track over an existing song. iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max users can also import any two-track projects into Logic Pro.

The array of puzzles available to Apple News Plus subscribers continues to grow. After iOS 17.5 brought the Quartiles word puzzle to the subscription news service earlier this year, Sudoku now joins the ranks of games.

You can try out a sample Sudoku game in the Puzzles section of the News app. But if you find yourself hooked, you'll need to pay $12.99/month for an Apple News Plus subscription.

You have a new option aimed at giving strangers a better opportunity of finding any lost items you've equipped with an AirTag. Enabled the new Share Item Location feature, and you can get a link showing the last known location of the item, that you can then handle over to a trusted third party -- Apple specifically mentions airlines in its iOS 18.2 documentation.

The link is live for a limited time and doesn't recall an Apple device, widening the pool of people who can track down anything you've left behind.

Here's an iPhone 16-specific addition to iOS 18.2 that brings three new control options to the button Apple added to this year's models. You now have the option to lock the autofocus and auto exposure settings when you apply light pressure to the Camera Control button, releasing that lock when you lift your finger. That option can be setting in the Camera section of the Settings app: just select Camera Control and toggle on the AE/AF Lock option.

Additionally, heading to the Accessibility section in Settings will let you adjust the double-click speed of the Camera Control button. Besides the default speed, your options are Slow and Slower.

In a settings change that's sure to ease the worries of anyone who frets about inadvertently pressing the Camera Control button when reaching for their phone, you can now set the button to only work when your iPhone's screen is active. Go to the Display & Brightness section of Settings and select Require Screen On for the Camera Control.

If you'd like the ability to adjust playback volume from your lock screen, you can add a volume slider in iOS 18.2. In the Settings app, select Accessibility, followed by Audio & Visual. On the ensuing screen, there's a Always Show Volume Control button that restores a slider to the lock screen just under the playback controls. This setting works whether you're listening via headphones or the built-in speaker on your iPhone.

Another new audio setting lets you adjust the limit of the iPhone speaker volume -- helpful if you don't want to damage the built-in speaker or annoy other people with the audio from whatever you're listening to. That setting can be found in the Sound & Haptics section of Settings, where you tap Volume Limit to toggle on the control and adjust the volume with a slider. Note that changes you make only seem to affect playback and not things like phone call and FaceTime volume, alerts, alarms, ringtones or system sounds.

iOS 18.2 expands the number of default apps you can change to include apps for phone calls and messaging -- see my guide on how to change default apps in the updated software. Oh, and if you use the Stocks app to follow the market, iOS 18.2 adds premarket quotes for both the Nasdaq and NYSE exchanges.",Tom's Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/iphones/new-ios-18-2-features,2024-12-19,
10 Tips to Maintain iPhone Battery Health,"So, you've just checked your iPhone battery health and are concerned because the level is dropping. I completely get you. It's natural for lithium-ion batteries in iPhones to degrade over time. As a result, the battery health doesn't remain the same as you use your iPhone. Therefore, it's crucial to maintain your iPhone battery health if you wish to prolong its lifespan. In this article, we've mentioned 10 tips that will ensure you get good usage between charges for a long time. If you've recently bought a new iPhone, you should follow tips to maintain iPhone battery health in the long run. Without any ado, let's begin!

Many users have an everyday routine of using their iPhones till the battery drops to 2 or 3 percent, and then charging it to 100%. If you're among them, this iPhone battery health tip is for you. Keeping your iPhone at full charge and then letting it die completely is one of the biggest battery killers. It can degrade the battery's health in the long run. To maintain the battery health of your iPhone, try not to charge your iPhone to 100% and then discharge it to 0 to 5%. If you wish to prolong the battery life and enjoy optimal performance on your iPhone, you can stick to a 30% to 80% battery level window.

Well, this isn't as difficult as you might think. You don't have to keep an eye on the battery levels all the time. Charge your iPhone at your convenience, but avoid charging it to 100% and then discharging it completely. If you ask me, I often charge my iPhone to 80 to 85% and plug it back when the battery level dips to around 30%.

We also recommend not to use your iPhone while charging. You can do some messaging or scroll through social media posts but avoid playing games or watching videos, if you wish to take care of your iPhone's battery.

Now, we know that overcharging isn't good for your iPhone. Thankfully, Apple offers a built-in iOS feature, Optimized Battery Charging that learns from your everyday charging habits and prevents overcharging. It tracks your everyday usage and charging patterns to predict when you connect it to a charger for an extended period. When enabled, Optimized Charging will temporarily pause the charge at 80% and top up the remaining 20% just before you start using your phone. In the long run, this feature helps reduce the natural aging of lithium-ion batteries and maintain iPhone battery health.

To enable Optimized Battery Charging on your iPhone, go to Settings -> Battery -> Battery Health & Charging and turn on the Optimized Battery Charging toggle.

Exposing your iPhone to ambient temperatures higher than 35° C /95° F can affect the battery's ability to hold a charge, giving you less time between the chargers. In the long run, it can permanently damage your phone's battery. To preserve the battery health of your iPhone, you must avoid exposing your device to extremely low or high temperatures. In case your iPhone overheats or displays a temperature warning, you should try to cool it down before using it or plugging in a charger. To do this, turn off your iPhone, remove the case (if you've installed one), and place it in a cooler area. Don't blast any cooled air or perform similar tricks. Just give your iPhone some time and it will return to a normal temperature.

It's worth knowing that it's normal for your iPhone to generate some heat in some cases. Common examples include playing heavy games or watching videos on cellular data at a stretch. Your iPhone should return to a normal temperature after some time. However, if you've installed a case that has a poor heat dissipation system, it can trap the generated heat and overheat your iPhone, which hampers the battery. In such a case, you must remove the case. If this doesn't help, here's our dedicated guide on how to fix iPhone overheating problems.

Many users have a habit of charging their iPhones overnight, after all, it's the most convenient option. However, if you frequently charge your iPhone overnight, it can damage the battery and reduce its lifespan. Frequent overnight charging is bad because it pushes more current than the capacity of the cells. Also, when your iPhone spends most of the night in a fully charged state, it impacts the overall battery's health.

To avoid any complications, you must give up on your habit of charging your iPhone overnight. Also, the Optimized Battery Charging feature comes in handy to maintain your iPhone battery health.

One of the best ways to prolong the battery health of your iPhone is to ensure that you use only Apple-certified chargers and cables. While you can find a variety of chargers in the market that can juice up your iPhone, not all of them are certified by Apple. That means they aren't of the same quality and you can't expect the same compatibility with the battery. In short, non-certified or poorly designed chargers aren't good for your iPhone battery health. Initially, they might throw slow or no charging problems and can deteriorate battery health over time.

To avoid any complications, we recommend using only Apple-branded or certified charging accessories. If you wish to go for third-party options, we advise opting for only MFi-certified chargers from trusted global brands.

Keeping your iPhone up-to-date with the latest iOS version helps you maintain the iPhone battery health. Apple regularly releases software updates that improve the overall performance of your devices. Also, they bring new features, fix any common glitches, and even keep the battery in good condition for a long time. That's not all. Software updates also come with certain battery-saving features. For instance, iOS 12 brought the Screen Time which can help you track how much time you spend on your iPhone & which apps you use the most. Therefore, it's a great idea to update your iPhone with the latest version of iOS.

To prolong your iPhone battery health and make the most out of a full battery charge, you should turn off any features you don't need. An iPhone offers a ton of features, and you might not need all of them. According to your preference and needs, you might want to disable some features and save battery life on your iPhone. Well, we aren't asking you to keep these features off all the time, that would not make any sense. You can simply disable some features that you don't need or aren't using actively. Let's have a quick look at them:

Gone are the days of fast charging. Today, faster and fastest charging features have become a way to attract users and judge how capable a smartphone is. Fast charging is great for quick top-ups when you wish to power your iPhone without spending a lot of time. However, frequent fast charging isn't good for your iPhone's battery. That's because fast charging forces the battery to take up a lot of power in a minimum time, which stresses the battery and impacts its long-term health.

I have a 35W MacBook charger that can rapidly charge my iPhone 14 Pro. However, I don't remember using it ever. I often charge my iPhone with a 20W and sometimes even switch to a 10W charger which slowly tops up my iPhone, maintaining the battery health.

Just like fast charging, wireless charging can be convenient for some users. However, wireless chargers can generate a lot of heat which can hamper the iPhone battery. It's a nice idea to use compatible wired chargers rather than wireless or MagSafe options. Of course, you can sometimes switch to wireless chargers, but make sure they are MFi-certified.

To get rid of minor software glitches and enjoy optimal performance, you must make a habit of restarting your iPhone at regular intervals. This will fix a lot of common problems, make your device more responsive, and keep the battery in good shape. Now, that's because, when you restart your iPhone, it immediately lightens the system load and clears away any minor iOS glitches that build up over time, giving a fresh start to the system.

Our final iPhone battery health tip is for users who are planning to store their iPhones. There can be instances when you're planning to upgrade to a new iPhone without trading in or giving away the older one. It's always a nice idea to keep backup option in case something goes wrong with your primary device or someone in your family needs a spare iPhone. Before you store your iPhone in a drawer for an extended period, make sure to charge the iPhone battery around 50%. Otherwise, you'll stuck with a non-functional iPhone the next time you take it out of your storage box.

All you need to do is charge your iPhone to 50% and then turn it off to prevent battery consumption before you store it. If you aren't planning to use that iPhone for a really long time, you should set a reminder to charge it again to 50% every six months.

Those were 10 tips to maintain battery health on your iPhone. While you can't stop lithium-ion batteries from degrading over time, these tips will help keep your iPhone battery in good condition for a long time. As a result, you can use your device for years without any notable battery-related problems.

"iPad Pro for Everything: How I Rethought My Entire Workflow Around the New 11"" iPad Pro","For the past two years since my girlfriend and I moved into our new apartment, my desk has been in a constant state of flux. Those who have been reading MacStories for a while know why. There were two reasons: I couldn't figure out how to use my iPad Pro for everything I do, specifically for recording podcasts the way I like, and I couldn't find an external monitor that would let me both work with the iPad Pro and play videogames when I wasn't working.

This article - which has been six months in the making - is the story of how I finally did it.

Over the past six months, I completely rethought my setup around the 11"" iPad Pro and a monitor that gives me the best of both worlds: a USB-C connection for when I want to work with iPadOS at my desk and multiple HDMI inputs for when I want to play my PS5 Pro or Nintendo Switch. Getting to this point has been a journey, which I have documented in detail on the MacStories Setups page.

This article started as an in-depth examination of my desk, the accessories I use, and the hardware I recommend. As I was writing it, however, I realized that it had turned into something bigger. It's become the story of how, after more than a decade of working on the iPad, I was able to figure out how to accomplish the last remaining task in my workflow, but also how I fell in love with the 11"" iPad Pro all over again thanks to its nano-texture display.

I started using the iPad as my main computer 12 years ago. Today, I am finally able to say that I can use it for everything I do on a daily basis.

iPad Pro for Podcasting, Finally

If you're new to MacStories, I'm guessing that you could probably use some additional context.

Through my ups and downs with iPadOS, I've been using the iPad as my main computer for over a decade. I love the iPad because it's the most versatile and modular computer Apple makes. I've published dozens of stories about why I like working on the iPad so much, but there was always one particular task that I just couldn't use the device for: recording podcasts while saving a backup of a Zoom call alongside my local audio recording.

I tried many times over the years to make this possible, sometimes with ridiculous workarounds that involved multiple audio interfaces and a mess of cables. In the end, I always went back to my Mac and the trusty Audio Hijack app since it was the easiest, most reliable way to ensure I could record my microphone's audio alongside a backup of a VoIP call with my co-hosts. As much as I loved my iPad Pro, I couldn't abandon my Mac completely. At one point, out of desperation, I even found a way to use my iPad as a hybrid macOS/iPadOS machine and called it the MacPad.

Fast forward to 2024. I've been recording episodes of AppStories, Connected, NPC, and Unwind from my iPad Pro for the past six months. By and large, this project has been a success, allowing me to finally stop relying on macOS for podcast recording. However, none of this was made possible by iPadOS or new iPad hardware. Instead, I was able to do it thanks to a combination of new audio hardware and Zoom's cloud recording feature.

When I record a show with my co-hosts, we're having a VoIP call over Zoom, and each of us has to record their own microphone's audio. After the recording is done, all of these audio tracks are combined in a single Logic project, mixed, and exported as the finished MP3 file you listen to in your podcast client of choice. It's a pretty standard procedure. When it comes to the iPad, there are two issues related to this process that iPadOS alone still can't provide a solution for:

As you can see, if I were to rely on iPadOS alone, I wouldn't be able to record podcasts the way I like to at all. This is why I had to employ additional hardware and software to make it happen.

For starters, per Jason Snell, I found out that Zoom now supports a cloud recording feature that automatically uploads and saves each participant's audio track. This is great. I enabled this feature for all the scheduled meetings in my Zoom account, and now, as soon as an AppStories call starts, the automatic cloud recording also kicks in. If anything goes wrong with my microphone, audio interface, or iPad at any point, I know there will be a backup waiting for me in my Zoom account a few minutes after the call is finished. I turned this option on months ago, and it's worked flawlessly so far, giving me the peace of mind that a backup is always happening behind the scenes whenever we record on Zoom.

But what about recording my microphone's audio in the first place? This is where hardware comes in. As I was thinking about this limitation of iPadOS again earlier this year, I realized that the solution had been staring me in the face this entire time: instead of recording my audio via iPadOS, I should offload that task to external hardware. And a particular piece of gear that does exactly this has been around for years.

Enter Sound Devices' MixPre-3 II, a small, yet rugged, USB audio interface that lets you plug in up to three microphones via XLR, output audio to headphones via a standard audio jack, and - the best part - record your microphone's audio to an SD card. (I use this one.)

That was my big realization a few months ago: rather than trying to make iPadOS hold a Zoom call and record my audio at the same time, what if I just used iPadOS for the call and delegated recording to a dedicated accessory?

I'm here to tell you that, after some configuration, this works splendidly. Here's the idea: the MixPre-3 acts as a USB interface for the iPad Pro, but at the same time, it can also record its microphone input to a WAV track that is kept completely separate from iPadOS. The recording feature is built into the MixPre's software itself; the iPad has no idea that it's happening. When I finish recording and press the stop button on the MixPre, I can then switch the device's operating mode from USB audio interface to USB drive, and my iPad will see the MixPre's SD card as an external source in the Files app.

Then, from the Files app, I can grab the audio file and upload it to Dropbox. For all my issues with the Files app (which has only marginally improved in iPadOS 18 with a couple of additions), I have to say that transferring heavy files from the MixPre's SD card has been reliable.

The trickiest aspect of using the MixPre with my iPad has been configuring it so that it can record audio from a microphone plugged in via XLR locally while also passing that audio over USB to the iPad and receiving audio from the iPad, outputting it to headphones connected to the MixPre. Long story short, while there are plenty of YouTube guides you can follow, I configured my MixPre in advanced mode so that it records audio using channel 3 (where my microphone is plugged in) and passes audio back and forth over USB using the USB 1 and 2 channels.

It's difficult for me right now to encapsulate how happy I am that I was finally able to devise a solution for recording podcasts with call backups on my iPad Pro. Sure, the real winners here are Zoom's cloud backup feature and the MixPre's excellent USB support. However, I think it should be noted that, until a few years ago, not only was transferring files from an external drive on the iPad impossible, but some people were even suggesting that it was ""wrong"" to assert that an iPad should support that feature.

As I'll explore throughout this story, the, ""An iPad isn't meant to do certain things,"" ship sailed years ago. It's time to accept the reality that some people, including me, simply prefer getting their work done on a machine that isn't a MacBook.

iPad Pro at a Desk: Embracing USB-C with a New Monitor

A while back, I realized that I like the idea of occasionally taking breaks from work by playing a videogame for a few minutes in the same space where I get my work done. This may seem like an obvious idea, but what you should understand about me is that I've never done this since I started MacStories 15 years ago. My office has always been the space for getting work done; all game consoles stayed in the living room, where I'd spend some time in the evening or at night if I wasn't working. Otherwise, I could play on one of my handhelds, usually in bed before going to sleep.

This year, however, the concept of taking a quick break from writing (like, say, 20 minutes) without having to switch locations altogether has been growing on me. So I started looking for alternatives to Apple's Studio Display that would allow me to easily hop between the iPad Pro, PlayStation 5 Pro, and Nintendo Switch with minimal effort.

Before you tell me: yes, I tried to make the Studio Display work as a gaming monitor. Last year, I went deep down the rabbit hole of USB-C/HDMI switches that would be compatible with the Studio Display. While I eventually found one, the experience was still not good enough for high-performance gaming; the switch was finicky to set up and unreliable. Plus, even if I did find a great HDMI switch, the Studio Display is always going to be limited to a 60Hz refresh rate. The Studio Display is a great productivity monitor, but I don't recommend it for gaming. I had to find something else.

After weeks of research, I settled on the Gigabyte M27U as my desk monitor. I love this display: it's 4K at 27"" (I didn't want to go any bigger than that), refreshes at 160Hz (which is sweet), has an actual OSD menu to tweak settings and switch between devices, and, most importantly, lets me connect computers and consoles over USB-C, HDMI, or DisplayPort.

There have been some downgrades coming from the Studio Display. For starters, my monitor doesn't have a built-in webcam, which means I had to purchase an external one that's compatible with my iPad Pro. (More on this later.) The speakers don't sound nearly as good as the Studio Display's, either, so I often find myself simply using the iPad Pro's (amazing) built-in speakers or my new AirPods Max, which I surprisingly love after a...hack.

Furthermore, the M27U offers 400 nits of brightness compared to the Studio Display's 600 nits. I notice the difference, and it's my only real complaint about this monitor, which is slim enough and doesn't come with the useless RGB bells and whistles that most gaming monitors feature nowadays.

In using the monitor, I've noticed something odd about its handling of brightness levels. By default, the iPad Pro connected to my CalDigit TS4 dock (which is then connected over USB-C to the monitor) wants to use HDR for the external display, but that results in a very dim image on the M27U:

The most likely culprit is the fact that this monitor doesn't properly support HDR over USB-C. If I choose SDR instead of HDR for the monitor, the result is a much brighter panel that doesn't make me miss the Studio Display that much:

Another downside of using an external monitor over USB-C rather than Thunderbolt is the lack of brightness and volume control via the Magic Keyboard's function keys. Neither of these limitations is a dealbreaker; I don't care about volume control since I prefer the iPad Pro's built-in speakers regardless, and I always keep the brightness set to 100% anyway.

The shortcomings of this monitor for Apple users are more than compensated for by its astounding performance when gaming. Playing games on the M27U is a fantastic experience: colors look great, and the high refresh rate is terrific to see in real life, especially for PS5 games that support 120Hz and HDR. Nintendo Switch games aren't nearly as impressive from a pure graphical standpoint (there is no 4K output on the current Switch, let alone HDR or 120Hz), but they usually make up for it in art direction and vibrant colors. I've had a lovely time playing Astro Bot and Echoes of Wisdom on the M27U, especially because I could dip in and out of those games without having to switch rooms.

What truly sells the M27U as a multi-device monitor isn't performance alone, though; it's the ease of switching between multiple devices connected to different inputs. On the back of the monitor, there are two physical buttons: a directional nub that lets you navigate various menus and a KVM button that cycles through currently active inputs. When one of my consoles is awake and the iPad Pro is connected, I can press the KVM button to instantly toggle between the USB-C input (iPad) and whichever HDMI input is active (either the PS5 or Switch). Alternatively, if - for whatever reason - everything is connected and active all at once, I can press the nub on the back and open the 'Input' menu to select a specific one.

I recognize that this sort of manual process is probably antithetical to what the typical Apple user expects. But I'm not your typical Apple user or pundit. I love the company's minimalism, but I also like modularity and using multiple devices. The M27U is made of plastic, its speakers are - frankly - terrible, and it's not nearly as elegant as the Apple Studio Display. At the same time, quickly switching between iPadOS and The Legend of Zelda makes it all worth it.

Looking ahead at what's coming in desktop monitor land, I think my next upgrade (sometime in late 2025, most likely) is going to be a 27"" 4K OLED panel (ideally with HDMI and Thunderbolt 5?). For now, and for its price, the M27U is an outstanding piece of gear that transformed my office into a space for work and play.

The 11"" iPad Pro with Nano-Texture Glass

You may remember that, soon after Apple's event in May, I decided to purchase a 13"" iPad Pro with standard glass. I used that iPad for about a month, and despite my initial optimism, something I was concerned about came true: even with its reduction in weight and thickness, the 13"" model was still too unwieldy to use as a tablet outside of the Magic Keyboard. I was hoping its slimmer profile and lighter body would help me take it out of the keyboard case and use it as a pure tablet more often; in reality, nothing can change the fact that you're holding a 13"" tablet in your hands, which can be too much when you just want to watch some videos or read a book.

I had slowly begun to accept that unchanging reality of the iPad lineup when Apple sent me two iPad Pro review units: a 13"" iPad Pro with nano-texture glass and a smaller 11"" model with standard glass. A funny thing happened then. I fell in love with the 11"" size all over again, but I also wanted the nano-texture glass. So I sold my original 13"" model and purchased a top-of-the-line 11"" iPad Pro with cellular connectivity, 1 TB of storage, and nano-texture glass.

It's no exaggeration when I say that this is my favorite iPad of all time. It has reignited a fire inside of me that had been dormant for a while, weakened by years of disappointing iPadOS updates and multitasking debacles.

I have been using this iPad Pro every day for six months now. I wrote and edited the entire iOS and iPadOS 18 review on it. I record podcasts with it. I play and stream videogames with it. It's my reading device and my favorite way to watch movies and YouTube videos. I take it with me everywhere I go because it's so portable and lightweight, plus it has a cellular connection always available. The new 11"" iPad Pro is, quite simply, the reason I've made an effort to go all-in on iPadOS again this year.

There were two key driving factors behind my decision to move from the 13"" iPad Pro back to the 11"": portability and the display. In terms of size, this is a tale as old as the iPad Pro. The large model is great if you primarily plan to use it as a laptop, and it comes with superior multitasking that lets you see more of multiple apps at once, whether you're using Split View or Stage Manager. The smaller version, on the other hand, is more pleasant to use as a tablet. It's easier to hold and carry around with one hand, still big enough to support multitasking in a way that isn't as cramped as an iPad mini, and, of course, just as capable as its bigger counterpart when it comes to driving an external display and connected peripherals. With the smaller iPad Pro, you're trading screen real estate for portability; in my tests months ago, I realized that was a compromise I was willing to make.

As a result, I've been using the iPad Pro more, especially at the end of the workday, when I can take it out of the Magic Keyboard to get some reading done in Readwise Reader or catch up on my queue in Play. In theory, I could also accomplish these tasks with the 13"" iPad Pro; in practice, I never did because, ergonomically, the larger model just wasn't that comfortable. I always ended up reaching for my iPhone instead of the iPad when I wanted to read or watch something, and that didn't feel right.

Much to my surprise, using the 11"" iPad Pro with old-school Split View and Slide Over has also been a fun, productive experience.

When I'm working at my desk, I have to use Stage Manager on the external monitor, but when I'm just using the iPad Pro, I prefer the classic multitasking environment. There's something to the simplicity of Split View with only two apps visible at once that is, at least for me, conducive to writing and focusing on the current task. Plus, there's also the fact that Split View and Slide Over continue to offer a more mature, fleshed-out take on multitasking: there are fewer keyboard-related bugs, there's a proper window picker for apps that support multiwindowing, and replacing apps on either side of the screen is very fast via the Dock, Spotlight, or Shortcuts actions (which Stage Manager still doesn't offer). Most of the iOS and iPadOS 18 review was produced with Split View; if you haven't played around with ""classic"" iPadOS multitasking in a while, I highly recommend checking it out again.

One of the other nice perks of Split View - a feature that has been around for years now, but I'd forgotten about - is the ease of multitasking within Safari. When I'm working in the browser and want to compare two webpages side by side, taking up equal parts of the screen, I can simply drag a tab to either side of the screen to create a new Safari Split View:

Conversely, doing the same with Stage Manager opens a new Safari window, which I then have to manually resize if I want to compare two webpages:

So far, I've focused on the increased portability of the 11"" iPad Pro and how enjoyable it's been to use a tablet with one hand again. Portability, however, is only one side of this iPad Pro's story. In conjunction with its portable form factor, the other aspect of the 11"" iPad Pro that makes me enjoy using it so much is its nano-texture glass.

Long story short, I'm a nano-texture glass convert now, and it's become the kind of technology I want everywhere.

My initial concern with the nano-texture glass was that it would substantially diminish the vibrancy and detail of the iPad Pro's standard glass. I finally had an OLED display on my iPad, and I wanted to make sure I'd fully take advantage of all its benefits over mini-LED. After months of daily usage, I can say not only that my concerns were misplaced and this type of glass is totally fine, but that this option has opened up new use cases for the iPad Pro that just weren't possible before.

For instance, I discovered the joy of working with my iPad Pro outside, without the need to chase down a spot in the shade so I can see the display more clearly. One of the many reasons we bought this apartment two years ago is the beautiful balcony, which faces south and gets plenty of sunlight all year long. We furnished the balcony so we could work on our laptops there when it's warm outside, but in practice, I never did because it was too bright. Everything reflected on the screen, making it barely readable. That doesn't happen anymore with the nano-texture iPad Pro. Without any discernible image or color degradation compared to the standard iPad Pro, I am - at long last - able to sit outside, enjoy some fresh air, and bask in the sunlight with my dogs while also typing away at my iPad Pro using a screen that remains bright and legible.

If you know me, you also know where this is going. After years of struggle and begrudging acceptance that it just wasn't possible, I took my iPad Pro to the beach earlier this year and realized I could work in the sun, with the waves crashing in front of me as I wrote yet another critique of iPadOS. I've been trying to do this for years: every summer since I started writing annual iOS reviews 10 years ago, I've attempted to work from the beach and consistently given up because it was impossible to see text on the screen under the hot, August sun of the Italian Riviera. That's not been the case with the 11"" iPad Pro. Thanks to its nano-texture glass, I got to have my summer cake and eat it too.

I can see the comments on Reddit already - ""Italian man goes outside, realizes fresh air is good"" - but believe me, to say that this has been a quality-of-life improvement for me would be selling it short. Most people won't need the added flexibility and cost of the nano-texture glass. But for me, being unable to efficiently work outside was antithetical to the nature of the iPad Pro itself. I've long sought to use a computer that I could take with me anywhere I went. Now, thanks to the nano-texture glass, I finally can.

iPad Pro and Video Recording for MacStories' Podcasts

I struggled to finish this story for several months because there was one remaining limitation of iPadOS that kept bothering me: I couldn't figure out how to record audio and video for MacStories' new video podcasts while also using Zoom.

What I'm about to describe is the new aspect of my iPad workflow I'm most proud of figuring out. After years of waiting for iPadOS to eventually improve when it comes to simultaneous audio and video streams, I used some good old blue ocean strategy to fix this problem. As it turns out, the solution had been staring me in the face the entire time.

Consider again, for a second, the setup I described above. The iPad is connected to a CalDigit Thunderbolt dock, which in turn connects it to my external monitor and the MixPre audio interface. My Neumann microphone is plugged into the MixPre, as are my in-ear buds; as I've explained, this allows me to record my audio track separately on the MixPre while coming through to other people on Zoom with great voice quality and also hearing myself back. For audio-only podcasts, this works well, and it's been my setup for months.

As MacStories started growing its video presence as a complement to text and audio, however, I suddenly found myself needing to record video versions of NPC and AppStories in addition to audio. When I started recording video for those shows, I was using an Elgato FaceCam Pro 4K webcam; the camera had a USB-C connection, so thanks to UVC support, it was recognized by iPadOS, and I could use it in my favorite video-calling apps. So far, so good.

The problem, of course, was that when I was also using the webcam for Zoom, I couldn't record a video in Camo Studio at the same time. It was my audio recording problem all over again: iPadOS cannot handle concurrent media streams, so if the webcam was being used for the Zoom call, then Camo Studio couldn't also record its video feed.

Once again, I felt powerless. I'd built this good-looking setup with a light and a microphone arm and a nice poster on the wall, and I couldn't do it all with my iPad Pro because of some silly software limitation. I started talking to my friend (and co-host of Comfort Zone) Chris Lawley, who's also been working on the iPad for years, and that's when it dawned on me: just like I did with audio, I should offload the recording process to external hardware.

My theory was simple. I needed to find the equivalent of the MixPre, but for video: a camera that I could connect over USB-C to the iPad Pro and use as a webcam in Zoom (so my co-hosts could see me), but which I could also operate to record video on its own SD card, independent of iPadOS. At the end of each recording session, I would grab the audio file from the MixPre, import the video file from the camera, and upload them both to Dropbox - no Mac involved in the process at all.

If the theory was correct - if iPadOS could indeed handle both the MixPre and a UVC camera at the same time while on a Zoom call - then I would be set. I could get rid of my MacBook Air (or what's left of it, anyway) for good and truly say that I can do everything on my iPad Pro after more than a decade of iPad usage.

And well...I was right.

I did a lot of research on what could potentially be a very expensive mistake, and the camera I decided to go with is the Sony ZV-E10 II. This is a mirrorless Sony camera that's advertised as made for vlogging and is certified under the Made for iPhone and iPad accessory program. After watching a lot of video reviews and walkthroughs, it seemed like the best option for me for a variety of reasons:

The ZV-E10 II seemed to meet all my requirements for an iPad-compatible mirrorless USB camera, so I ordered one in white (of course, it had to match my other accessories) with the default 16-50mm lens kit. The camera arrived about two months ago, and I've been using it to record episodes of AppStories and NPC entirely from my iPad Pro, without using a Mac anywhere in the process.

To say that I'm happy with this result would be an understatement. There are, however, some implementation details and caveats worth covering.

For starters, the ZV-E10 II notoriously overheats when recording long sessions at 4K, and since NPC tends to be longer than an hour, I had to make sure this wouldn't happen. Following a tip from Chris, we decided to record all of our video podcasts in 1080p and upscale them to 4K in post-production. This is good enough for video podcasts on YouTube, and it allows us to work with smaller files while preventing the camera from running into any 4K-related overheating issues. Second, to let heat dissipate more easily and quickly while recording, I'm doing two things:

In terms of additional hardware, I'm also using a powerful 12"" Neewer ring light for proper lighting with an adjustable cold shoe mount to get my angle just right. I tried a variety of ring lights and panels from Amazon; this one had the best balance of power and price for its size. (I didn't want to get something that was too big since I want to hide its tripod in a closet when not in use.)

The software story is a bit more simplistic, and right in line with the limitations of iPadOS we're familiar with. If you've followed along with the story so far, you know that I have to plug both my MixPre-3 II and ZV-E10 II into the iPad Pro. To do this, I'm using a CalDigit TS4 dock in the middle that also handles power delivery, Ethernet, and the connection to my monitor. The only problem is that I have to remember to connect my various accessories in a particular order; specifically, I have to plug in my audio interface last, or people on Zoom will hear me speaking through the camera's built-in microphone.

This happens because, unlike macOS, iPadOS doesn't have a proper 'Sound' control panel in Settings to view and assign different audio sources and output destinations. Instead, everything is ""managed"" from the barebones Control Center UI, which doesn't let me choose the MixPre-3 II for microphone input unless it is plugged in last. This isn't a dealbreaker, but seriously, how silly is it that I can do all this work with an iPad Pro now and its software still doesn't match my needs?

When streaming USB audio and video to Zoom on the iPad from two separate devices, I also have to remember that if I accidentally open another camera app while recording, video in Zoom will be paused. This is another limitation of iPadOS: an external camera signal can only be active in one app at a time, so if I want to, say, take a selfie while recording on the iPad, I can't - unless I'm okay with video being paused on Zoom while I do so.

When I'm done recording a video, I press the stop button on the camera, grab its SD card, put it in Apple's USB-C SD card adapter, and plug it into the iPad Pro. To do this, I have to disconnect the Thunderbolt cable that connects my iPad Pro to the CalDigit TS4. I can't plug the adapter into the Magic Keyboard's secondary USB-C port since it's used for power delivery only, something that I hope will change eventually. In any case, the Files app does a good enough job copying large video files from the SD card to my iPad's local storage. On a Mac, I would create a Hazel automation to grab the latest file from a connected storage device and upload it to Dropbox; on an iPad, there are no Shortcuts automation triggers for this kind of task, so it has to be done manually.

And that's pretty much everything I have to share about using a fancy webcam with the iPad Pro. It is, after all, a USB feature that was enabled in iPadOS 17 thanks to UVC; it's nothing new or specific to iPadOS 18 this year. While I wish I had more control over the recording process and didn't have to use another SD card to save videos, I'm happy I found a solution that works for me and allows me to keep using the iPad Pro when I'm recording AppStories and NPC.

iPad Pro and the Vision Pro

I'm on the record saying that if the Vision Pro offered an 'iPad Virtual Display' feature, my usage of the headset would increase tenfold, and I stand by that. Over the past few weeks, I've been rediscovering the joy of the Vision Pro as a (very expensive) media consumption device and stunning private monitor. I want to use the Vision Pro more, and I know that I would if only I could control its apps with the iPad's Magic Keyboard while also using iPadOS inside visionOS. But I can't; nevertheless, I persist in the effort.

As Devon covered in his review of visionOS 2, one of the Vision Pro's new features is the ability to turn into a wireless AirPlay receiver that can mirror the screen of a nearby Apple device. That's what I've been doing lately when I'm alone in the afternoon and want to keep working with my iPad Pro while also immersing myself in an environment or multitasking outside of iPadOS: I mirror the iPad to the Vision Pro and work with iPadOS in a window surrounded by other visionOS windows.

Now, I'll be honest: this is not ideal, and Apple should really get around to making the iPad a first-class citizen of its $3,500 spatial computer just like the Mac can be. If I don't own a Mac and use an iPad as my main computer instead, I shouldn't be penalized when I'm using the Vision Pro. I hope iPad Virtual Display is in the cards for 2025 as Apple continues to expand the Vision line with more options. But for now, despite the minor latency that comes with AirPlay mirroring and the lack of true integration between the iPad's Magic Keyboard and visionOS, I've been occasionally working with my iPad inside the Vision Pro, and it's fun.

There's something appealing about the idea of a mixed computing environment where the ""main computer"" becomes a virtual object in a space that is also occupied by other windows. For example, one thing I like to do is activate the Bora Bora beach environment about halfway (so that it's in front of me, but doesn't cover my keyboard), turn down the iPad's display brightness to a minimum (so it's not distracting), and write in Obsidian for iPad - mirrored via AirPlay to the Vision Pro - while other windows such as Messages, Aura for Spotify, and Safari surround me.

Aforementioned limitations notwithstanding, I've found some tangible benefits in this setup. I can keep music playing at a medium volume via the Vision Pro's audio pods, which sound great but also keep me aware of my surroundings. Potentially distracting apps like Messages can be physically placed somewhere in my room so they're nearby, but outside my field of view; that way, I can send a quick Tapback reaction using hand gestures or type out a quick response using the Vision Pro's virtual keyboard, which is only good for those types of responses anyway. And most importantly, I can make my iPad's mirrored window bigger than any external monitor I have in my apartment, allowing me to place a giant Obsidian window at eye level right in front of me.

Since I started using Spigen's head strap with my Vision Pro, I completely solved the issue of neck fatigue, so I can wear and work in the headset for hours at a time without any sort of pain or strain on my muscles.

I don't need to extol the virtues of working with a traditional computing environment inside visionOS; for Mac users, it's a known quantity, and it's arguably one of the best features of the Vision Pro. (And it's only gotten better with time.) What I'm saying is that, even with the less flexible and not as technically remarkable AirPlay-based flavor of mirroring, I've enjoyed being able to turn my iPad's diminutive display into a large, TV-sized virtual monitor in front of me. Once again, it goes back to the same idea: I have the most compact iPad Pro I can get, but I can make it bigger via physical or virtual displays. I just wish Apple would take things to the next level here for iPad users as well.

iPad Pro as a Media Tablet for TV and Game Streaming...at Night

In the midst of working with the iPad Pro, something else happened: I fell in love with it as a media consumption device, too. Despite my appreciation for the newly ""updated"" iPad mini, the combination of a software feature I started using and some new accessories made me completely reevaluate the iPad Pro as a computer I can use at the end of the workday as well. Basically, this machine is always with me now.

Let's start with the software. This may sound obvious to several MacStories readers, but I recently began using Focus modes again, and this change alone allowed me to transform my iPad Pro into a different computer at night.

Specifically, I realized that I like to use my iPad Pro with a certain Home and Lock Screen configuration during the day and use a different combo with dark mode icons at night, when I'm in bed and want to read or watch something. So after ignoring them for years, I created two Focus modes: Work Mode and Downtime. The first Focus is automatically enabled every morning at 8:00 AM and lasts until 11:59 PM; the other one activates at midnight and lasts until 7:59 AM. This way, I have a couple of hours with a media-focused iPad Home Screen before I go to sleep at night, and when I wake up around 9:00 AM, the iPad Pro is already configured with my work apps and widgets.

I don't particularly care about silencing notifications or specific apps during the day; all I need from Focus is a consistent pair of Home and Lock Screens with different wallpapers for each. As you can see from the images in this story, the Work Mode Home Screen revolves around widgets for tasks and links, while the Downtime Home Screen prioritizes media apps and entertainment widgets.

This is something I suggested in my iPad mini review, but the idea here is that software, not hardware, is turning my iPad Pro into a third place device. With the iPad mini, the act of physically grabbing another computer with a distinct set of apps creates a clear boundary between the tools I use for work and play; with this approach, software transforms the same computer into two different machines for two distinct times of day.

I also used two new accessories to smooth out the transition from business during the day to relaxation at night with the iPad Pro. A few weeks back, I was finally able to find the kind of iPad Pro accessory I'd been looking for since the debut of the M4 models: a back cover with a built-in kickstand. Last year, I used a similar cover for the M2 iPad Pro, and the idea is the same: this accessory only protects the back of the device, doesn't have a cover for the screen, and comes with an adjustable kickstand to use the iPad in landscape at a variety of viewing angles.

The reason I wanted this product is simple. This is not a cover I use for protecting the iPad Pro; I only want to attach it in the evening, when I'm relaxing with the iPad Pro on my lap and want to get some reading done or watch some TV. In fact, this cover never leaves my nightstand. When I'm done working for the day, I leave the Magic Keyboard on my desk, bring the iPad Pro into the bedroom, and put it in the cover, leaving it there for later.

I know what you're thinking: couldn't I just use a Magic Keyboard for the same exact purpose? Yes, I could. But the thing is, because it doesn't have a keyboard on the front, this cover facilitates the process of tricking my brain into thinking I'm no longer in ""work mode"". Even if I wanted, I couldn't easily type with this setup. By making the iPad Pro more like a tablet rather than a laptop, the back cover - combined with my Downtime Focus and different Home Screen - reminds me that it's no longer time to get work done with this computer. Once again, it's all about taking advantage of modularity to transform the iPad Pro into something else - which is precisely what a traditional MacBook could never do.

But I went one step further.

If you recall, a few weeks ago on NPC, my podcast about portable gaming, I mentioned a ""gaming pillow"" - a strange accessory that promises to provide you with a more comfortable experience when playing with a portable console by combining a small mounting clasp with a soft pillow to put on your lap. Instead of feeling the entire weight of a Steam Deck or Legion Go in your hand, the pillow allows you to mount the console on its arm, offload the weight to the pillow, and simply hold the console without feeling any weight on your hands.

Fun, right? Well, as I mentioned in the episode, that pillow was a no-brand version of a similar accessory that the folks at Mechanism had pre-announced, and which I had pre-ordered and was waiting for. In case you're not familiar, Mechanism makes a suite of mounting accessories for handhelds, including the popular Deckmate, which I've been using for the past year. With the Mechanism pillow, I could combine the company's universal mounting system for my various consoles with the comfort of the pillow to use any handheld in bed without feeling its weight on my wrists.

I got the Mechanism pillow a few weeks ago, and not only do I love it (it does exactly what the company advertised, and I've been using it with my Steam Deck and Legion Go), but I also had the idea of pairing it with the iPad Pro's back cover for the ultimate iPad mounting solution...in bed.

All I had to do was take one of Mechanism's adhesive mounting clips and stick it to the back of the aforementioned iPad cover. Now, if I want to use the iPad Pro in bed without having to hold it myself, I can attach the cover to the gaming pillow, then attach the iPad Pro to the cover, and, well, you can see the result in the photo above. Believe me when I say this: it looks downright ridiculous, Silvia makes fun of me every single day for using it, and I absolutely adore it. The pillow's plastic arm can be adjusted to the height and angle I want, and the whole structure is sturdy enough to hold everything in place. It's peak laziness and iPad comfort, and it works incredibly well for reading, watching TV, streaming games with a controller in my hands, and catching up on my YouTube queue in Play.

Speaking of streaming games, there is one final - and very recent - addition to my iPad-centric media setup I want to mention: NDI streaming.

NDI (which stands for Network Device Interface) is a streaming protocol created by NewTek that allows high-quality video and audio to be transmitted over a local network in real time. Typically, this is done through hardware (an encoder) that gets plugged into the audio/video source and transmits data across your local network for other clients to connect to and view that stream. The advantages of NDI are its plug-and-play nature (clients can automatically discover NDI streamers on the network), high-bandwidth delivery, and low latency.

We initially covered NDI in the context of game streaming on MacStories back in February, when John explained how to use the Kiloview N40 to stream games to a Vision Pro with better performance and less latency than a typical PlayStation Remote Play or Moonlight environment. In his piece, John covered the excellent Vxio app, which remains the premier utility for NDI streaming on both the Vision Pro and iPad Pro. He ended up returning the N40 because of performance issues on his network, but I've stuck with it since I had a solid experience with NDI thanks to my fancy ASUS gaming router.

Since that original story on NDI was published, I've upgraded my setup even further, and it has completely transformed how I can enjoy PS5 games on my iPad Pro without leaving my bed at night. For starters, I sold my PS5 Slim and got a PS5 Pro. I wouldn't recommend this purchase to most people, but given that I sit very close to my monitor to play games and can appreciate the graphical improvements enabled by the PS5 Pro, I figured I'd get my money's worth with Sony's latest and greatest PS5 revision. So far, I can confirm that the upgrade has been incredible: I can get the best possible graphics in FFVII Rebirth or Astro Bot without sacrificing performance.

Secondly, I switched from the Kiloview N40 to the bulkier and more expensive Kiloview N60. I did it for a simple reason: it's the only Kiloview encoder that, thanks to a recent firmware upgrade, supports 4K HDR streaming. The lack of HDR was my biggest complaint about the N40; I could see that colors were washed out and not nearly as vibrant as when I was playing games on my TV. It only seemed appropriate that I would pair the PS5 Pro with the best possible version of NDI encoding out there.

After following developer Chen Zhang's tips on how to enable HDR input for the N60, I opened the Vxio app, switched to the correct color profile, and was astounded:

The image above is a native screenshot of Astro Bot being streaming to my iPad Pro using NDI and the Vxio app over my network. Here, let me zoom in on the details even more:

Now, picture this: it's late at night, and I want to play some Astro Bot or Final Fantasy VII before going to sleep. I grab my PS5 Pro's DualSense Edge controller, wake up the console, switch the controller to my no-haptics profile, and attach the iPad Pro to the back cover mounted on the gaming pillow. With the pillow on my lap, I can play PS5 games at 4K HDR on an OLED display in front of me, directly from the comfort of my bed. It's the best videogame streaming experience I've ever had, and I don't think I have to add anything else.

If you told me years ago that a future story about my iPad Pro usage would wrap up with a section about a pillow and HDR, I would have guessed I'd lost my mind in the intervening years. And here we are.

Hardware Mentioned in This Story

Here's a recap of all the hardware I mentioned in this story:

After months of research for this story, and after years of experiments trying to get more work done from an iPad, I've come to a conclusion:

Sometimes, you can throw money at a problem on the iPad and find a solution that works.

I can't stress this enough, though: with my new iPad workflow, I haven't really fixed any of the problems that afflict iPadOS. I found new solutions thanks to external hardware; realistically, I have to thank USB-C more than iPadOS for making this possible. The fact that I'm using my iPad Pro for everything now doesn't mean I approve of the direction Apple has taken with iPadOS or the slow pace of its development.

As I was wrapping up this story, I found myself looking back and reminiscing about my iPad usage over the past 12 years. One way to look at it is that I've been trying to get work done on the iPad for a third of my entire life. I started in 2012, when I was stuck in a hospital bed and couldn't use a laptop. I persisted because I fell in love with the iPad's ethos and astounding potential; the idea of using a computer that could transform into multiple things thanks to modularity latched onto my brain over a decade ago and never went away.

I did, however, spend a couple of years in ""computer wilderness"" trying to figure out if I was still the same kind of tech writer and if I still liked using the iPad. I worked exclusively with macOS for a while. Then I secretly used a Microsoft Surface for six months and told no one about it. Then I created a hybrid Mac/iPad device that let me operate two platforms at once. For a brief moment, I even thought the Vision Pro could replace my iPad and become my main computer.

I'm glad I did all those things and entertained all those thoughts. When you do something for a third of your life, it's natural to look outside your comfort zone and ask yourself if you really still enjoy doing it.

And the truth is, I'm still that person. I explored all my options - I frustrated myself and my readers with the not-knowing for a while - and came out at the end of the process believing even more strongly in what I knew years ago:

The iPad Pro is the only computer for me.

Even with its software flaws, scattershot evolution, and muddled messaging over the years, only Apple makes this kind of device: a thin, portable slab of glass that can be my modular desktop workstation, a tablet for reading outside, and an entertainment machine for streaming TV and videogames. The iPad Pro does it all, and after a long journey, I found a way to make it work for everything I do.

I've stopped using my MacPad, I gave up thinking the Vision Pro could be my main computer, and I'm done fooling myself that, if I wanted to, I could get my work done on Android or Windows.

I'm back on the iPad. And now more than ever, I'm ready for the next 12 years.",MacStories,https://www.macstories.net/stories/ipad-pro-for-everything/,2024-12-18,

Rating: 4.75/5

With the launch of the M4-powered MacBooks, we are now in the fourth generation of the Apple silicon-powered MacBook Pros and boy, do we have something special in our hands. While Windows laptops, thanks to ARM-based models and Intel's Core Ultra 200V processors, have made some impressive strides, the MacBook Pro still holds the crown when it comes to offering a seamless mix of power, efficiency, and refinement.

Apart from the generational bump in improvement and efficiency (something that cannot be taken for granted anymore) we also get some meaningful upgrades with the MacBook Pros. The base model now features 16GB of unified memory, addressing a long-standing issue that the 8GB of memory that Apple was providing in a machine marked for Pros. The webcam gets a major boost, with a 12MP sensor that produces crisp, detailed visuals for video calls and photos.

Even battery life, which was already a strong point for the MacBook Pro, has been further improved, with the 14-inch model easily lasting a full workday and beyond. Apple also introduced a matte-finished nano-texture display option, adding a quality-of-life feature that many users were asking for.

Then, there is macOS Sequoia, paired with the M4 silicon which brings a smarter, more intuitive experience. And of course, there is macOS Sequoia, and the bunch of Apple Features that has started to roll in for beta users.

In daily use, the MacBook Pro M4 is a joy. It handles demanding tasks like video editing, rendering, and multitasking effortlessly while staying cool and responsive.

Having said that though, there still are a few chinks in the armour, here and there. But are they big and glaring enough that the put a dent into the experience of daily driving the 2024 M4-powered MacBook Pro? Well, we find out.

The MacBook Pro M4 hasn't gone through a major makeover, but that's not a bad thing. It still rocks its signature aluminium design -- lightweight, solid, and as classy as ever. The little touches like the front lip that makes opening the lid a breeze and the trusty Touch ID button for super-fast logins are still here, and they're as handy as ever.

At 31.26 x 22.12 x 1.55 cm and weighing just 1.55 kg, this 14-inch laptop is ridiculously easy to carry around. It slides into your bag like it belongs there and doesn't make you feel like you're hauling a brick.

Yes, there are professional laptop that come in at a smaller footprint, but do they look as premium as the MacBook Pro? Do they even come close to the performance and thermal efficiency of the might Apple Silicon? No chance.

Apple has given the M4 MacBook Pro a tiny but meaningful upgrade when it comes to ports. The base model now includes three Thunderbolt 4 ports, up from two on the M3, along with an SD card slot, an HDMI port, a MagSafe 3 charging port, and the good old headphone jack. What I really appreciate is the fact that one of the Thunderbolt 4 ports is now on the right-hand side, as opposed to being bunched up all on one sides.

For those who need even more, the higher-end models with the M4 Pro chip throw in Thunderbolt 5 -- because why not?

The Thunderbolt 4 port supports native DisplayPort 1.4, whereas the Thunderbolt 5 port goes up to DisplayPort 2.1.

One fun new perk is the colour selection. Gone are the days when you had to spend extra on the Pro models just to get the super-cool Space Black finish. Now, even the entry-level M4 MacBook Pro comes in both Silver and Space Black. The black version is seriously striking, though it's not completely smudge-proof, so expect a few fingerprints by the end of the day.

This 14-inch MacBook Pro might look compact, but it doesn't hold back. The keyboard is spacious and comfortable for long typing sessions, and the trackpad is roomy and smooth to use. The speakers are another win, delivering great sound for everything from Zoom calls to late-night Netflix binges.

In a nutshell, the MacBook Pro M4 doesn't mess with a winning formula. It's the same dependable, premium laptop with just enough upgrades to keep things fresh. Whether it's the added ports, the expanded colour options, or that unbeatable combination of portability and power, it's ready to handle whatever you throw at it.

The display on the MacBook Pro 14-inch continues to be a head-turner, even though it hasn't undergone any dramatic changes from the previous model. Apple has opted to stick with the winning formula -- a Liquid Retina XDR display that's sharp, vibrant, and a joy to look at. With a resolution of 3024x1964 and a pixel density of 254 pixels per inch, this screen makes everything from spreadsheets to blockbuster movies pop.

Apple's ProMotion technology is here too, offering adaptive refresh rates up to 120Hz for buttery-smooth visuals. Whether you're gaming, editing, or just scrolling through social media, the display keeps up beautifully. Fixed refresh rate options are also available, so you can choose what works best for specific tasks.

Apple has introduced a nano-texture display option this year, which is available as a ₹15,000 add-on. This coating is a game-changer for anyone who finds themselves working in bright or overly lit spaces. It significantly reduces glare and reflections, making it easier to see what's on screen, even in challenging lighting conditions.

However, it's not all sunshine -- this display is a bit more delicate to clean. Apple provides a specialised microfibre cloth or its Polishing Cloth in the box, and they strongly recommend using only that. It's a slight inconvenience, but the trade-off is a screen that handles bright light like a pro.

The display's brightness levels are genuinely impressive. It can hit up to 1600 nits of peak brightness for HDR content, 1000 nits for sustained use, and another 1000 nits for SDR. Even when using the laptop under direct sunlight, like when I was editing documents in the back seat of a cab during a ride from Noida to Gurugram, posed no problems. I did not need to squint or awkwardly adjust the laptop to see what's on the screen, which is a massive plus for people who are constantly on the go.

As for colours, Apple delivers its usual perfection. The panel supports Dolby Vision, HDR10, and HLG, ensuring a cinematic experience whether you're watching content or creating it. It also covers 100% of the sRGB colour space, 87% of AdobeRGB, and 98% of the DCI-P3 gamut. Translation?

It's ideal for everything from casual Netflix binges to professional-level video editing. TrueTone also adds an extra layer of convenience by automatically adjusting the colour temperature to match your environment, and if you're a stickler for accuracy, the display is easy to calibrate.

While the display is a marvel, there are a couple of niggles. The lack of a touchscreen option in 2024 feels like a missed opportunity. Touchscreens are becoming more common in high-end laptops, and it would have been a welcome addition here.

Also, the display is still not OLED panel, which would have offered even deeper blacks and better contrast. Then there's the notch, which sits in the centre of the screen. While you get used to it over time, it can occasionally feel intrusive, especially if you're using apps with sprawling menus.

Apple continues to dominate when it comes to laptop keyboards, and the MacBook Pro 14-inch sticks to the winning formula. The keyboard is nearly perfect, with keys that have just enough travel and a satisfying tactile feel. It's a dream for touch typists, but even if you're not one, typing on this keyboard feels natural and enjoyable.

The backlit array remains as handy as ever for working in low-light conditions, and the Touch ID power button in the top-right corner is both convenient and secure. If you've used a MacBook before, the familiar layout and feel will make you feel right at home.

That said, there is one small downside. The keys start with a sleek matte finish that feels premium, but after a bit of use, they tend to pick up oils from your fingers, leaving behind smudges that are tough to clean. It's not a dealbreaker, but it's something to keep in mind.

The trackpad, meanwhile, remains unbeatable. Apple's Force Touch trackpad on the MacBook Pro 14-inch is large, precise, and packed with features. From pressure-sensing capabilities and force clicks to multi-touch gestures and pressure-sensitive drawing, it offers an unmatched level of functionality and responsiveness. Navigating with it feels effortless, whether you're editing photos, switching apps, or simply browsing.

What truly sets Apple's trackpad apart is how seamlessly it integrates into the overall user experience. No other laptop comes close in terms of precision and usability, making this one of the MacBook Pro's standout features.

The MacBook Pro M4 makes a serious upgrade to its webcam, and it's hard not to notice. The new 12MP Center Stage camera is a huge step up from the 1080p one on the M3 model. The difference is night and day -- images are sharper, details pop, and even casual selfies on Photo Booth look way better. It's perfect for video calls or virtual meetings, where a clear picture can make all the difference.

We particularly like the Center Stage feature of the MacBook Pro's camera, that keeps you front and centre during calls, even if you're moving around. Whether you're pacing during a presentation or grabbing a prop mid-discussion, the camera smoothly adjusts to keep you in the frame.

But then there's Desk View -- a feature that tries to give a bird's-eye view of your desk. Unfortunately, it feels more like a gimmick. The image looks distorted and low-res, making it more frustrating than useful. If you really need to show off your desk setup, using your iPhone with Apple's Continuity Camera is a much smarter choice.

The speakers on the MacBook Pro M4 are nothing short of brilliant. Apple has packed in a six-speaker system with force-cancelling woofers and tweeters, and the result is sound that feels rich and detailed.

Vocals are clear, the bass is punchy but balanced, and the mids are spot on. Whether it's a video call, a movie night, or your favourite playlist, the audio quality doesn't miss a beat.

Things get even better with Spatial Audio support. With Dolby Atmos, you get a surround-sound experience that makes you feel like you're right in the middle of the action. If you're using AirPods with dynamic head tracking, the audio becomes even more immersive. The system handles a variety of formats like MP3, FLAC, Apple Lossless, and Dolby Digital, so it's versatile no matter what you're listening to.

Apple's MacBook Pro M4 sets a new bar for laptop performance, delivering a level of power that's hard to ignore. It outpaces the M1 Max-based MacBook Pro from three years ago and comes strikingly close to the base model of the M2 Max MacBook Pro from early 2023. This leap forward makes the M4 a machine that can handle nearly any task with ease, and for the vast majority of users, it will be more than enough.

At the heart of this beast is the new M4 chip, built on an advanced 3-nanometre process. In the unit that we were testing, Apple has crammed in a 10-core CPU with four high-performance cores and six efficiency cores, which ensures exceptional speed and multitasking.

We also get a 10-core GPU which offers ray tracing that's twice as fast as its predecessor, making it a creative powerhouse. Add to that a 16-core Neural Engine capable of 38 TOPS and an overall 120GB/s memory bandwidth, and you've got a laptop that doesn't just work -- it soars.

In my testing, the MacBook Pro M4 breezed through everything that I threw at it. Dozens of Chrome tabs? No problem. Heavy-duty creative work in Photoshop and Premiere Pro? Easy.

It handled it all without hesitation. Even editing 4K ProRes video footage shot on the new iPhone 16 Pro Max in Final Cut Pro felt effortless. For most creators and professionals our test unit with its 16GB RAM and 1TB SSD would be a dream setup with excellent value for the performance it delivers.

And for some reason If you're looking for more grunt, Apple has you covered. The M4 Pro and M4 Max variants offer even more horsepower, with options that include up to 14 CPU cores and GPUs with up to 40 cores.

Then, there is gaming. Gaming has long been the Achilles' heel of Macs, but starting with the M3 SoC, Apple has been slowly changing the narrative. With the M4 chip, they are really starting to push things to a whole new level.

With dynamic mesh shading and faster ray tracing, Apple's GPU is catching up, offering smoother, more immersive gameplay. Recent titles like Resident Evil Village and Assassin's Creed Mirage showcase what's possible. Plus, gamers are also seeing a library that's expanding by the day.

Apple's Game Porting Tool also makes it easier for developers to bring triple-A titles to Apple's ecosystem. Then, there is the company's shared hardware ecosystem that spans devices like iPhones and iPads.

Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch M4 2024 Review: MacOS Sequoia & Apple Intelligence

The MacBook Pro M4 ships with macOS Sequoia, and it's packed with features that make the experience smoother and more intuitive. I upgraded to the developer beta of macOS 15.2 to try out the latest Apple Intelligence tools, but even before diving into AI, Sequoia brings some noteworthy updates.

One of the biggest quality-of-life improvements in macOS Sequoia is the new window tiling feature. It's finally easier to arrange your workspace -- just drag a window to the left or right of your screen, and the OS snaps it into place. While it's not as robust as tools like Rectangle, it's a welcome addition that makes multitasking less of a hassle.

Another highlight is iPhone Mirroring, which allows you to access your iPhone directly from your Mac, even if the phone is in another room. I tested this extensively, and it worked like a charm. The connection was seamless, giving me full access to my apps and notifications.

I found it incredibly useful for tasks like tracking packages, responding to emails, transferring files, and even placing orders on apps like Zomato. It's a small but powerful feature that significantly reduced the time I spent picking up my phone.

The star of macOS 15.2 is Apple Intelligence, which brings AI tools to everyday tasks. Writing Tools, for instance, makes summarising long notes or reformatting text a breeze.

You can turn paragraphs into bullet points or create professional summaries to place at the top of your document. While I don't love the idea of AI proofreading my copy, I can see its usefulness for email drafting or fine-tuning a professional tone.

However, not all features hit the mark. Image Playground, Apple's generative AI tool, feels inconsistent. When I asked it to imagine a person as a Formula 1 driver, it outright refused to work. Even after tweaking the prompt to something simpler, like reimagining the person with a racing helmet, the results were far from impressive. Clearly, Apple still has some ground to cover in this area.

For those looking to push creativity further, the macOS 15.2 developer beta also integrates ChatGPT. This expands the potential of generative AI on macOS.

For example, I asked it to sketch a whimsical image of a dog driving a car, and it delivered in seconds. While this is more fun than functional, it shows the potential for generative AI in creative workflows.

macOS Sequoia and its developer beta for 15.2 bring exciting features that refine how you work and interact with your devices. From better window management to iPhone Mirroring and AI tools that assist with writing and creativity, there's plenty to explore.

While some features, like Image Playground, need more polish, the overall updates make macOS feel smarter and more user-friendly than ever. For anyone invested in the Apple ecosystem, this is a step in the right direction.

The 14-inch MacBook Pro M4 is equipped with a solid 72.4Wh battery and comes paired with a 70W USB-C power adapter for the MagSafe cable. While laptops across the board have been making strides in battery performance, Apple's latest MacBook Pro continues to set a standard.

MacBooks have long been known for their exceptional battery endurance, often outlasting Windows laptops. However, that's changing. ARM-based Windows machines and even Intel's newer x86 laptops have narrowed the gap with impressive battery optimisation.

However, the M4 MacBook Pro still reigns supreme. Windows laptops powered by ARM chips might boast up to 16-17 hours of battery life and excellent sleep efficiency, but they often struggle with compatibility issues, which takes away a lot in terms of viability.

In terms of sheer battery life, the 14-inch MacBook Pro M4 still maintains an edge. Apple claims up to 24 hours of video playback and around 16 hours of wireless web browsing. These figures aren't just marketing fluff -- our testing showed these estimates to be accurate.

In fact, some outlets have been reporting that they are getting even better battery life than Apple.

Whether you're streaming movies, working on presentations, or simply browsing, this laptop can easily handle a full workday and still have enough juice left for some downtime.

The secret to the MacBook Pro's impressive battery life boils down to the M4 chip and how efficient it is. Apple has fine-tuned the power-to-performance ratio, ensuring that the machine delivers top-tier performance while just sipping power. The display also plays a role -- it's not only visually stunning but also energy-efficient, further extending battery life.

The MacBook Pro M4 doesn't come cheap, but for what it offers, it's worth every penny. Apple has once again delivered a laptop that combines timeless design, premium build quality, and performance that sets the bar for others. If you're a content creator looking for a powerful, portable machine, the M4 MacBook Pro deserves a serious look -- especially if it fits your budget.

This year's M4 series of Apple Silicon this year is mighty impressive, delivering exceptional performance and efficiency. Whether you're editing videos, designing graphics, or juggling multiple demanding applications, this laptop doesn't miss a beat.

The addition of Apple Intelligence features, though still rolling out, promises to make workflows even smarter and more seamless. The new 12MP webcam is a significant improvement for video calls and content creation, and the battery life is, frankly, ridiculous -- lasting well beyond a full workday.

The nano-texture display, while optional, is a standout feature for those who work in bright environments. It's disappointing that this feature comes with an additional Rs 15,000 price tag, but it's a worthwhile investment for professionals who need a glare-free display.

For most users, the base MacBook Pro, powered by the M4 silicon with a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU will be more than enough. It's an incredibly capable machine for content creation, coding, or general professional use. However, if your work involves a lot of 3D animations, rendering complex CAD models, training AI workloads, or gaming at high FPS, the M4 Pro or M4 Max variants are better suited for the job.

These configurations pack extra power and graphics capability for more demanding tasks.

The MacBook Pro M4 is as close to perfection as a laptop gets, despite its shortcomings. With its unmatched performance, sleek design, and incredible battery life, it is a solid choice for professionals. There is simply no mucking about it -- all things considered, the MacBook Pro continues to be the best professional-grade laptop on the market.",Firstpost,https://www.firstpost.com/tech/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-m4-2024-review-the-best-just-got-better-13844901.html,2024-12-16,
You Can Download the First iOS 18.3 Developer Beta on Your iPhone Right Now,"Nelson Aguilar is an LA-based tech how-to writer and graduate of UCLA. With more than a decade of experience, he covers Apple and Google and writes on iPhone and Android features, privacy and security settings and more.

Apple recently released iOS 18.2 to the general public, but the company is already looking beyond that for the iPhone.

Today, Apple released iOS 18.3 beta 1 for developers. It's not apparent what and if there are any new features, but there do seem to be some bug fixes to Genmoji and other Apple Intelligence features. We'll update with more information as we get it.

Heads up: You can download the iOS 18.3 developer beta and use Apple Intelligence only if you have an iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max or the iPhone 16 series.

If you don't have the iPhone 15 Pro or 15 Pro Max, you can still use this guide to download the latest iOS 18 dev beta -- you just won't get the Apple Intelligence features.

The Apple Developer program has long required a fee to join, at $100 per year. Last year, with the release of the iOS 17 developer beta, Apple created a free tier of the Apple Developer program, which allows you to download any developer betas for free as long as you have an Apple ID.

Just because you can download the iOS 18.3 developer beta for free doesn't mean you need to, or should.

Early developer betas, such as this one, are intended for developers to test their apps on upcoming versions of iOS. It's also a way for developers to identify and report bugs, which helps Apple improve the software before it's released to the general public. That's a major reason why you may not want to download the iOS 18.3 developer beta on your phone: the bugs.

A software bug, or any other glitches, can make your phone unstable. You may not be able to use some of your favorite apps, and even if you can, you may deal with apps that crash unexpectedly. The performance of your entire phone could be affected; the developer beta could make your phone lag or lead your battery to drain faster than usual or even overheat.

I've downloaded developer betas on my personal iPhone for the last decade, and haven't faced any major issues. It's mostly just annoying when an app crashes or my battery dies quickly, but I've always managed.

If you have a backup iPhone, you should definitely use that for the iOS 18.3 developer beta, because you won't need it every day, so you won't feel the full effects of any bugs or other issues. If you don't have one, running iOS 18.3 developer beta on your primary should hopefully be fine.

In case you still want iOS 18 but don't want to deal with the developer beta, there's always the more stable public beta for iOS 18, which is now live. Unfortunately, there is no iOS 18.3 public beta just yet.

Before you start downloading the iOS 18.3 developer beta, there are a few things you should know:

In case you ever want to go back to iOS 18, here's our step-by-step guide.

Now, you're ready to sign up for the Apple Developer program.

There's now a free tier of the Apple Developer program, which allows you to download any developer beta without paying. Using the Apple ID that's connected to the device you want to update to iOS 18.3, do the following:

3. Finally, read through the Apple Developer Agreement, check all the boxes and hit Submit.

You won't get full access to the development tools that the paid Apple Developer program membership offers, but you'll have access to the iOS 18.3 developer beta. If you're a developer, you should consider signing up for the paid version.

You can download the iOS 18.3 developer beta manually, but the easiest way to do it is with an over-the-air update -- just like you would download and install your regular iOS update. After you sign up for the Apple Developer program, you should see the option to download the iOS 18.3 developer beta in your settings.

To download the iOS 18.3 developer beta over-the-air, here's what you need to do:

Enter your passcode, agree to the terms and conditions and then just wait for the update to install on your iPhone. Depending on your internet connection, the entire process should take about 10 or 15 minutes.

Once your phone reboots, you should be running the iOS 18.3 developer beta.

The problem with an over-the-air update is that it requires a certain amount of storage, so if your storage is nearly full, you won't be able to use the option in the previous section. Fortunately, you can use your computer to update to the iOS 18.3 developer beta.

1. On your Mac, go to this Apple Developer Program download page, find ""iOS 18.3 beta,"" click Download Restore Images and download the iOS beta software restore image for your iPhone model.

2. Connect your phone to your computer and enter your device passcode or hit Trust This Computer.

3. Open a Finder window and then click your device in the sidebar under Locations.

4. Finally, hold down the Option key, click Check for Update and choose the iOS 18.3 beta software restore image you just downloaded from the Apple Developer website.

The iOS 18.3 developer beta software will begin to install on your iPhone. Wait for a few minutes and when your phone reboots, you should have access to iOS 18.3.

Once you download the iOS 18.3 developer beta, you must join a waitlist for Apple Intelligence if you haven't already. Go to Settings > Apple Intelligence & Siri and tap Join the Apple Intelligence Waitlist > Join Waitlist. It took a couple hours for Apple Intelligence to arrive on my phone, but some people have reported the AI features going live a few minutes after waitlisting.

Once Apple Intelligence is available to you, you'll receive a notification and you can go through a quick tutorial of some of the features that are now live, including Writing Tools and AI-powered Siri. You can go to the Apple Intelligence & Siri page to disable the setting if you no longer want to use it.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/you-can-download-the-first-ios-18-3-developer-beta-on-your-iphone-right-now/,2024-12-16,
13 Reasons to Wait for Next Year's iPhone 17,"Apple's iPhone development roadmap runs several years into the future and the company is continually working with suppliers on several successive iPhone models simultaneously, which is why we sometimes get rumored feature leaks so far ahead of launch. The iPhone 17 series is no different - already we have some idea of what to expect from Apple's 2025 smartphone lineup.

If you plan to skip this year's iPhone 16, or if you're just plain curious about what's on the horizon, here are 13 rumored features that we are expecting to arrive in time for its successor, the iPhone 17 series, which is likely to be released in September 2025.

Apple plans to launch an all-new iPhone 17 model with a ""significantly thinner"" design, reports The Information. The device, which could be called ""iPhone 17 Air,"" will allegedly feature a ""major redesign"" that could feature a single rear camera located at the top-center of the device, along with a narrower Dynamic Island, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. However, one rumor claims the battery will be around 6mm thick, suggesting that the device itself will be thicker than this. Apple's thinnest ever iPhone was the iPhone 6 at 6.9mm, meaning that the iPhone 17 ""Air"" may not be much thinner than the 2014 flagship. The device is rumored to have a 6.5-inch display size, and may replace the iPhone 17 Plus model, but this is unconfirmed. Other potential features include an aluminum chassis, an A19 chip, an Apple-designed 5G modem, and an improved front camera. See our iPhone 17 ""Slim"" rumor roundup for more.

2. New All-Aluminum Design

All iPhone 17 Models

Apple is reportedly planning to bring all its devices back to aluminum with the iPhone 17 lineup. The two flagship iPhone 17 Pro models will mark the return of aluminum frames to high-end iPhones for the first time since Apple began distinguishing between Pro and non-Pro models. In recent years, aluminum frames have been reserved for lower-end devices like the iPhone SE and iPhone 16, while premium models featured stainless steel frames until the iPhone 15 Pro, which introduced a titanium chassis as a major upgrade. This shift in materials for the iPhone 17 lineup signals a unified approach, with aluminum frames set to return across the entire device range.

3. Rectangular Camera Bump

iPhone 17 Pro & iPhone 17 Pro Max

Next year's iPhone 17 Pro models will reportedly feature a major redesign, specifically centering around changes to the rear camera module. The devices are rumored to feature a new rear design combining aluminum and glass. The top half of the back will be aluminum, incorporating a ""rectangular camera bump"" made from aluminum instead of the traditional 3D glass. The bottom half will remain glass to enable wireless charging. While Apple has used a glass back since the iPhone 8 and iPhone X in 2017, earlier iPhone models -- except the iPhone 3G, iPhone 3GS, and iPhone 5C -- had aluminum rears. Additionally, the aluminum camera bump on the iPhone 17 Pro will reportedly be larger than in previous models, according to The Information.

4. New Display Sizes

iPhone 17 & iPhone 17 Plus

This year's iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max got bigger display sizes, going from 6.12- and 6.69-inches to 6.27- and 6.86-inches, respectively. For 2025, Apple is also expected to bring the larger 6.27-inch display size to its standard iPhone model, while the equivalent ""iPhone 17 Plus"" model (provisionally called ""iPhone 17 Air"") could adopt completely new display dimensions.

5. 120Hz ProMotion (Always-on Display)

iPhone 17 & iPhone 17 Plus

Apple intends to expand ProMotion to all iPhone models in 2025, allowing all models to ramp up to a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling and video content when necessary. Previously, only ""Pro"" models in Apple's iPhone lineup have had the feature. Notably, ProMotion would also enable the display on the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 ""Air"" to ramp down to a more power-efficient refresh rate as low as 1Hz, allowing for an always-on display that can show the Lock Screen's clock, widgets, notifications, and wallpaper even when the device is locked.

Apple's premium 2025 models are expected to be equipped with an Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip for the first time. Wi-Fi 7 support would allow the ""Pro"" models to send and receive data over the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands simultaneously with a supported router, resulting in faster Wi-Fi speeds, lower latency, and more reliable connectivity. The Wi-Fi chip would also allow Apple to further reduce its dependance on external suppliers like Broadcom, which currently supplies Apple with a combined Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip for iPhones.

An upgraded 48-megapixel Telephoto lens on Apple's largest premium device is expected to be optimized for use with Apple's Vision Pro headset. That would make 2025's ""Pro Max"" the first iPhone to have a rear camera system composed entirely of 48-megapixel lenses, making it capable of capturing even more photographic detail.

The iPhone 17 lineup will feature a 24-megapixel front-facing camera with a six-element lens, according to one rumor. The iPhone 14 and 15 feature a 12-megapixel front-facing camera with five plastic lens elements, and this year's iPhone 16 lineup features the same hardware. The upgraded resolution to 24 megapixels on the iPhone 17 will allow photos to maintain their quality even when cropped or zoomed in, while the larger number of pixels will capture finer details. The upgrade to a six-element lens should also slightly enhance image quality.

The iPhone 17 will feature an anti-reflective display that is more scratch-resistant than Apple's Ceramic Shield found on iPhone 15 models, according to one rumor, although the new iPhone 16 Pro models do have the latest-generation Ceramic Shield, which has an advanced formulation that is 2x tougher than glass on any other smartphone. The outer glass on the iPhone 17 is said to have a ""super-hard anti-reflective layer"" that is ""more scratch-resistant."" It's not clear whether Apple is planning to adopt the Gorilla Glass Armor that Samsung uses in its Galaxy S24 Ultra, but the description of Corning's latest technology matches the rumor.

At least one model in Apple's iPhone 17 lineup will come with 12GB. Jeff Pu of investment firm Haitong has claimed that both Pro models will come with the upped RAM, while Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes only the iPhone 17 Pro Max will feature 12GB. In contrast, another reliable source has claimed that all iPhone 17 models will have 12GB of RAM. For comparison, the standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus have 6GB of RAM, and the iPhone 15 Pro models have 8GB of RAM, while all iPhone 16 models have 8GB of RAM. Any such increase would allow for improved multitasking on the iPhone, as well as provide additional resources for Apple Intelligence features that require large-language models to be resident in memory.

Apple's highest-end 2025 iPhone will feature a significantly narrower Dynamic Island, thanks to the device's adoption of a smaller ""metalens"" for the Face ID system, claims Haitong's Jeff Pu. While a traditional iPhone camera has curved lenses that redirect light towards the image sensor, a metalens is a thin and flat lens with microscopic patterns etched onto it that can focus light more precisely. Assuming this results in a narrowed Dynamic Island , it would be the first time that Apple has changed the feature since it debuted on the iPhone 14 Pro in 2022.

Apple typically upgrades iPhones with faster and more efficient chip technology each year. While we are not expecting the iPhone 17 series to get TSMC's next-generation 2-nanometer chips, Apple's A19 chip technology is likely to be built on an upgraded 3-nanometer process. The iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to include an A19 Pro chip, while the iPhone 17 and the iPhone 17 Air could have the standard A19 chip. TSMC is working on its N3P process, with mass production set to begin in late 2024, so that's the chip technology that we're expecting Apple will use for the iPhone 17 lineup. Compared to earlier versions of 3nm chips, the N3P chips offer increased performance efficiency and increased transistor density.

Apple is switching over to a new Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chip that it designed in-house starting in 2025. The combined Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chip will replace iPhone components from Broadcom, allowing Apple to reduce its reliance on the company. Apple's Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chip is distinct from the 5G modem chip that Apple is also designing, but eventually, Apple wants to combine these into a single component. The ultimate goal is to create a wireless setup where the components are tightly integrated and more energy efficient, allowing Apple to cut down on the battery use of cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth technologies. Apple will also be able to create thinner devices and new wearable technology with the custom chips that it is creating.",MacRumors,https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/16/12-reasons-wait-for-iphone-17/,2024-12-16,
The most common iPhone 16 problems (and how to fix them),"Table of Contents Table of Contents Your touchscreen becomes unresponsive You're experiencing poor battery life Your iPhone 16 reboots randomly Camera app lags or freezes Apple Pay or other NFC features not working Camera app opening randomly

Apple's latest iPhone 16 lineup packs in some exciting new features. The latest and greatest A18 chip brings the standard iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus duo closer to their iPhone 16 Pro counterparts than they've been in years, while the iPhone 16 Pro Max gets bigger than ever with a 6.9-inch display and the thinnest bezels of any smartphone yet.

The entire iPhone 16 family is more in harmony than ever this year, as Apple seems to have abandoned the trend of artificially limiting features like the Dynamic Island and Action Button to its Pro models, only to bring them to the standard ones a year later. Instead, this year's marquee new feature, the Camera Control, can be found on all four models. Sure, there are plenty of things that are still exclusive to the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max, like the 120Hz ProMotion Display and 5x telephoto camera, but those at least feel like valid differentiators for a ""Pro"" model.

An iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, or iPhone 16 Pro Max

However, like all smartphones, new iPhones can come with new problems, and sometimes it takes Apple a while to work out all the bugs. The good news is that most glitches early adopters run into are software-related, which is why nearly every iOS release offers what Apple calls ""stability and performance improvements."" While there's always a chance you got a defective iPhone 16, that's relatively uncommon. Apple's iOS is a complex piece of software, and early releases don't always play nice with the latest hardware.

So, before we get into the specific problems, it's worth mentioning that many of these may be solved in later software updates. In fact, some have already been solved in the iOS 18 point releases that are available now. We understand that some folks are reluctant to try new releases as soon as they become available for fear of encountering new bugs, but iOS point releases generally improve things. More significantly, each iOS update also typically includes important security fixes -- vulnerabilities that are disclosed with that iOS update, letting every malicious hacker know how to attack iPhones running older iOS versions. This means the first thing you should do when encountering problems, no matter how small, is ensure that you've updated to the latest version of iOS 18 by opening the Settings app and selecting General > Software update. If an update is available, install it.

Your touchscreen becomes unresponsive

One of the first widespread complaints we heard when new iPhone 16 units began landing in customers' hands in September were problems with unresponsive touchscreens. Theories on why this was happening ranged from problems with the new Camera Control to the slimmer bezels causing skin to come into contact with the edges of the screen when holding the iPhone and thereby triggering the touch rejection algorithm.

Solutions Ensure you've updated your iPhone to the latest iOS 18 release. Apple officially fixed this in iOS 18.0.1, and we haven't heard any recent reports. However, new iPhone 16 units are likely still shipping with iOS 18.0 pre-installed, and updates won't necessarily be installed automatically. Use a case on your iPhone 16. Many folks have reported this problem doesn't occur at all with an encased iPhone. That makes sense if it's being triggered by skin contact with the edges of the screen; the best iPhone 16 cases usually have raised edges to protect the screen from impacts, but these will also help keep the edges of your palms off the display. If all else fails, reach out to Apple Support or visit your local Apple Store or Apple Authorized Service Provider (AASP). Although most of these issues have been addressed in software updates, unresponsive touchscreens can still be caused by hardware problems, too. You're experiencing poor battery life

It's quite common to hear complaints of battery life after a new iPhone or major iOS release lands, and first-day upgraders are likely impacted by both, since their new iPhone 16 comes with iOS 18 -- an update they may not have installed on their older iPhone. However, even if you're coming over from an iPhone 15 Pro Max running the latest version of iOS 18, you may still take a hit on battery performance for a few days.

Solutions Most often this problem just requires a bit of patience. New iPhones typically have a break-in period while they're still optimizing things in the background and calibrating the battery levels. This can take anywhere from a couple of days to a week or more. You may see an even greater impact on your battery life if you're moving data over from another iPhone. Caches and indexes aren't typically backed up or transferred, so these have to be rebuilt, which takes time and consumes more power. Ensure 5G Auto is enabled in Settings > Cellular > Cellular data options > Voice & data. 5G typically consumes more power than 4G/LTE, but since it's not needed most of the time -- especially when your iPhone is idle -- your iPhone can manage this intelligently and only power up the 5G radios when you need the best performance. Reduce your screen brightness and ensure Auto-Brightness hasn't been disabled, as this could cause your screen to run brighter than necessary, which consumes more power. This should be on by default, but you can find it in Settings > Accessibility > Display & text size to confirm. Open Settings > Battery and check for suggestions on settings such as screen brightness and auto-lock that could be negatively impacting your battery life. You can also use the information here to see which apps have consumed the most power over the last 24 hours and last 10 days. If anything stands out here, consider using those apps less or even deleting them. If a power-hungry app shows ""Background Activity"" you can switch it off under Settings > General > Background app refresh. Your iPhone 16 reboots randomly

We've seen a few isolated reports of folks who find their iPhones randomly restarting for seemingly no reason at all. In some cases, this can happen while the iPhone is charging -- wirelessly or otherwise -- while others have experienced sudden restarts while using the iPhone.

Note that two different things that can occur that may both seem like ""reboots."" If your iPhone screen momentarily goes blank with a spinning progress indicator but comes back after a few seconds, that's known as a ""springboard restart,"" and involves only the user interface (e.g., the home screen and status bar). A full reboot will typically return you to the Apple logo and take a minute or two before you can use your iPhone again. You'll also be required to enter your passcode or password before you can use Face ID or Touch ID.

While both scenarios can be equally annoying, random full reboots are often the sign of a hardware issue while springboard restarts (""resprings"") can be caused by corrupt settings or dodgy apps. This often happens when restoring an iPhone from older backups, as cruft can travel with those backups across every iPhone you've ever owned, and sooner or later hit an iOS version that doesn't know how to deal with it.

Solutions If you're only experiencing resprings or reboots when using specific apps, check the App Store to ensure you've updated them to the latest versions and try removing and reinstalling them from the App Store. With cloud-based apps, you shouldn't risk losing any data, although you may need to sign in to the service and reconfigure your preferences. If the app stores data locally, be sure you've backed up anything you want to keep. Do a forced restart. This often helps to solve resprings by cleaning out anything deeper that could be causing problems with the high-level user interface apps like those that run the home screen and lock screen. If you're iPhone is acutally rebooting on its own, a forced restart may seem counterintuitive, but a deliberate restart flushes out data that may not be cleaned up when the iPhone abruptly reboots without taking the time to shut itself down properly. If resprings occur across multiple apps, try resetting some of your global preferences. In the Settings app under General > Transfer or reset iPhone > Reset, you'll find options to reset various categories of settings, along with Reset all settings to take care of everything at once. None of these will remove any data, although resetting the network settings (or all settings) will clear out any saved Wi-Fi networks, so be sure you have the passwords handy for any you need to reconnect to. Wiping and factory resetting your iPhone entirely can help to troubleshoot the problem, and we've encountered many cases where even restoring from the same backup causes these issues to go away. This is likely because backups only include permanent data and not caches and temporary files, both of which could contribute to the problem. Try setting it up as a new device without restoring a backup to see if the problem recurs. If it does, then you're likely dealing with a hardware issue. If you're experiencing reboots or hangs after restoring your iPhone data from iCloud, a Mac, or a PC, then you may be dealing with a corrupted backup. If this is a new iPhone, try transferring your data directly from your old iPhone. You can also try using a different backup to see if that helps; iCloud stored the three most recent backups, so you can select an older one. If you back up to both iCloud and your computer, try restoring the other backup. Check the system logs by going to Settings > Privacy & security > Analytics & improvements > Analytics data. You llkely won't be able to decipher most of what's here, but the key is to scroll through the list and look for entires that mention the word ""panic."" These refer to kernel panics where the core operating system crashes entirely, and they usually indicate a hardware issue. Camera app lags or freezes

We saw a number of reports early on of folks having problems with the camera app lagging or freezing up entirely. In some cases, this happens even when performing basic actions like zooming in or taking a photo.

This problem hasn't been reported as much recently, so it's possible that Apple fixed it in an iOS 18 update or it was unique to new phones and settled down after the initial break-in period.

Solutions Ensure you're running the latest iOS 18 release. Apple noted in the iOS 18.0.1 release notes that it fixed an issue where the camera would ""freeze when recording macro mode video on the Ultra Wide camera in 4K with HDR turned off on iPhone 16 Pro models."" That's incredibly specific, but it's possible that was whatever fix was applied for that situation cleared up the broader problem. If you're already up to date on iOS 18 and you're using a newer iPhone, wait it out. It's not uncommon to encounter performance issues while iOS is performing background optimizations. Apple Pay or other NFC features not working

Some folks have reported problems related to the NFC hardware on their new iPhones. While this sometimes manifests itself as problems making payments with Apple Pay, it's more commonly an issue only with reading NFC cards and tags. This includes stored payment cards like transit passes, security keys, and NFC stickers. In most cases, the iPhone refuses to acknowledge the existence of the tag entirely -- nothing happens when you hold it up to the back of your iPhone, leaving you wondering if you're holding it properly.

Solutions Grab a free app like NFC Tools and try using it to read your NFC security key, card, or tag. This will help you confirm if the app you're using -- or the built-in iOS feature for security keys -- is the problem. Try restarting your iPhone. It's a cliché, but it often works to solve problems like these. Some users have reported that toggling Airplane Mode, Cellular Data, or even AirDrop settings gets the NFC reader going again. Resetting network settings also helps in some cases. You can find this in the Settings app under General > Transfer or reset iPhone > Reset > Reset network settings. Note that this will remove all saved Wi-Fi networks and passwords, so you'll have to reconnect to your Wi-FI network again after it finishes (be sure you have the password handy). If the problem is also affecting your ability to make payments with Apple Pay then it's more likely a hardware issue or a problem with the Secure Element. We recommend reaching out to Apple Support if simple troubleshooting steps like restaring your iPhone don't resolve the issue. Camera app opening randomly

Some new iPhone 16 owners have found their camera app unexpectedly popping up at inopportune times, from the middle of serious gaming sessions to sitting idle in their pockets. This can be a distraction in the first case, and a potential battery killer in the second. This is an issue we've almost never seen on older iPhone models, so the most likely culprit is the new Camera Control that Apple introduced on this year's models. While the new button has several functions, its most basic one is to open the built-in Camera app (or another camera-related app of your choice) when fully pressed.

Solutions Try a different case. The case you're using may be putting too much pressure on the Camera Control button and inadvertently activating it. Most iPhone 16 cases are made to accommodate the Camera Control, but not everyone cares about the new button, and it can be tempting to use a cheaper case in that situation. You can require a double click to open the Camera app by going to Settings > Camera > Camera Control and selecting Double Click under ""Launch camera."" You typically require two clicks to launch the camera when your iPhone is sleeping at the lock screen -- one to wake your iPhone up and a second to open the camera app -- but this setting will require two presses in quick succession before the camera starts up. You can also adjust the Double Click Speed in the Accessibility section further down on that same screen. If you don't plan to use the Camera Control at all, you can turn it off entirely in the Accessibility settings. However, this doesn't just prevent the Camera Control from opening the Camera app; it renders the button entirely inert.",Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/most-common-iphone-16-problems-and-how-to-fix/,2024-12-16,

Apple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips. Slightly less than half of Apple's sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution.

What's Next for iPhones? Apple Seems to Have Big Plans in 2025,"Expertise Apple | Samsung | Google | Smartphones | Smartwatches | Wearables | Fitness trackers

Apple might have more than just its typical iPhone launches in store for next year. If the reports are true, 2025 could mark a few significant firsts for Apple's 16-year-old device.

Apple may release its first ""slim"" iPhone model, put its own 5G modems inside the iPhone for the first time and we may see the first iPhone SE with Face ID. Plus, we'll likely get a much closer look at Apple's AI plans for the iPhone, since the current wave of Apple Intelligence features feels like just the beginning.

There's a lot riding on Apple's plans for the iPhone in 2025. At a time when consumers are holding onto their phones for longer periods of time, it's harder than ever to entice iPhone users to upgrade. According to a CNET survey in partnership with YouGov, 44% of smartphone owners only buy a new phone when their current one needs replacing.

But with rumored new models like the iPhone 17 Slim and a redesigned cheaper iPhone, Apple could have an easier time exciting potential shoppers.

If it gets it right, that is. If Apple does release a significantly thinner iPhone, there's a chance that the extra-svelte design will come at a higher cost. And given the lukewarm reception Apple Intelligence has gotten so far, the pressure will be on Apple to impress consumers with new features next year.

While Samsung, Google and other Android phone makers offer screens that fold in half, Apple is sticking with the same traditional bar shape the iPhone has had since its inception. But the company is reportedly considering shaking up the iPhone's design in a different way: by making it significantly thinner.

Reports from The Information, Bloomberg and TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo indicate Apple may release a notably slimmer iPhone in 2025 instead of an iPhone 17 Plus.

The phone's sleek looks would be its main attraction; it would likely have similar specifications as the standard iPhone 17 otherwise but with a few compromises. For example, Kuo reports that this phone would have a single rear camera instead of the double camera found on the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus. It would also have the same processor as the base iPhone 17, according to the analyst.

The iPhone 17 Slim, if well received, could be just what Apple needs to get consumers excited about its non-Pro iPhones. That's to say, perhaps a snazzy redesign will coerce consumers to upgrade because they want to, not because they need to. Over the last two years, Apple's strategy has involved trickling features down from the Pro models, such as the Dynamic Island and the Action Button, to its standard iPhones to make them feel fresh and new compared to their predecessors.

But with the iPhone 17 Slim, Apple would be introducing an entirely new style of iPhone for the first time since 2022, back when it launched the first Plus. Still, that phone didn't feel as novel and original as the iPhone 17 Slim likely will. Instead of just changing the size of the screen, it sounds like Apple is rethinking the iPhone's design in a way that would make it feel more portable and premium than a regular iPhone, a value proposition that's not too different from that of a flip phone-style foldable phone. Flip phones, for example, stand out for their unconventional looks and more compact designs. If Apple were to release a sleeker iPhone, it would presumably check both of those boxes, too.

That said, there's a chance the iPhone 17 Slim will come with some tradeoffs, particularly around pricing since it could be more expensive than the Pro Max model, according to The Information. The phone's extreme thinness could also raise durability concerns, although it's impossible to know until Apple releases the product -- if it does at all. The device is said to be 6-millimeters thin, according to analyst Jeff Pu as MacRumors reported, which would make it notably sleeker than the 7.8mm iPhone 16.

Otherwise, the iPhone 17 lineup will likely come with fresh processors from Apple and screens with higher refresh rates across all four models (only the Pros have this feature currently), according to ETNews. All new iPhone models will also reportedly have a higher resolution 24-megapixel selfie camera, says analyst Jeff Pu per MacRumors.

The iPhone SE is expected to get a glow up. The fourth-generation of Apple's entry-level phone, which the company is expected to release in 2025, is said to have an edge-to-edge display like Apple's other iPhones, Face ID, the Action button, a 48-megapixel camera and Apple Intelligence, according to reports from MacRumors, Bloomberg and Kuo. That would represent a huge overhaul from the current model, released back in 2022, which looks like an iPhone 8 with the same chip as the iPhone 13.

Those changes alone could make the iPhone SE a compelling option for those looking to replace their current iPhone but don't need high-end specs like a smoother screen and additional camera. Android phones like the Google Pixel 8A have been leaving the iPhone SE in the dust in terms of design, screen size and camera capabilities, but it sounds like that could change with the next model.

There's another reason why the iPhone SE 4 could be particularly special: It may provide a peek at Apple's first cellular modem. Apple is reportedly developing its own modem, which is the component that enables phones to connect to cellular networks, to reduce its reliance on long term partner and rival Qualcomm, according to Bloomberg. The iPhone SE 4 will be the first Apple product with the modem when it launches next spring, the report says, before making its way to more premium devices.

Apple's first modem is said to be less capable than Qualcomm's; it won't, for example, support millimeter wave 5G, says Bloomberg. But the initiative would give Apple more control over its product development cycle, which could eventually result in new capabilities and better performance the same way its M-series chips have for the Mac.

Apple Intelligence, the company's first major push into consumer-facing AI, officially arrived in October, providing a glimpse into Apple's vision for how AI can make our phones more useful. But the first wave of features doesn't bring radical changes to the iPhone and neither did the second phase, which arrived in December.

Apple Intelligence, in its current form, primarily consists of assistive tools for tasks such as erasing objects from photos, rewriting text and getting tech help from Siri, along with the ability to create emojis and images based on a prompt. Siri also now has ChatGPT integration, and iPhone 16 owners can use the camera button to launch Visual Intelligence, which lets you learn about the world around you using the camera.

But next year, Apple will start laying the groundwork for what could be a larger shift in how we use our phones -- primarily thanks to Siri. Apple's virtual helper will be able to incorporate personal context into responses, take action within apps and understand what's on your phone's screen to assist with answering questions.

Those changes could make Siri a far more capable virtual assistant and could perhaps set the stage for a broader shift towards the iPhone's software becoming more intelligent. Apple indeed has larger plans to revamp Siri with more sophisticated large language models (i.e. the same tech that fuels ChatGPT), according to Bloomberg. This new Siri would be capable of answering questions more quickly and in a more natural manner, more similar to Google's Gemini and OpenAI's ChatGPT.

But that overhaul isn't expected to arrive until 2026 even if Apple announces it next year, the report says. If accurate, this would mean Apple's true answer to OpenAI and Google's chatbot would come to the market much later than its competitors, putting more pressure on Apple's technology to be successful. But Apple sees this as a long-term play and would rather wait until it's perfected its own unique approach rather than rushing to catch up, which is its modus operandi.

""We view it sort of like multitouch, which enabled the smartphone revolution and the modern tablet,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook said to Wired's Steven Levy in a recent interview when asked if he had considered charging for Apple Intelligence.

Rumblings of an iPhone that bends in half have circulated for years, but don't expect to see one anytime soon. Bloomberg reports that a foldable iPad will likely come before a foldable iPhone, and both devices are likely still years away.

Android phone makers have looked to foldable designs as a means to reinvigorate the smartphone market amid stalling sales and longer upgrade cycles. But even though the market for foldable phones is expected to grow by 10.5% in 2024 according to the International Data Corporation, growth is slowing as phonemakers -- particularly those in China, where foldables are particularly popular -- are shifting their focus to generative AI.

Foldable phones can be beneficial for the right type of consumer, but their high prices make them hard to justify for most. Traditional phones are so ingrained in our lives that it's going to take a convincing argument to coerce shoppers into trying something new. The fact that Apple hasn't released a foldable phone yet -- and doesn't seem to be in a rush to do so -- suggests it may have the same perspective.

Until Apple publicly announces its new products, nothing is certain. But if the reports turn out to be true, 2025 will have much more in store than your average iPhone launch. Given that Apple has a reputation for showing consumers why new technologies are useful rather than being first, the expectations for new products like Apple Intelligence (and perhaps eventually a foldable iPhone) are particularly high.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/whats-next-for-iphones-apple-seems-to-have-big-plans-in-2025/,2024-12-15,
"Download iOS 18.2 Now for ChatGPT in Siri, New AI Features and More","The wait is over for some of the most anticipated Apple Intelligence features. Apple released iOS 18.2 on Dec. 11, and the update brings a whole host of AI to your iPhone -- if you have a compatible one. Genmoji, Visual Intelligence and ChatGPT integrated Siri are just a few of the new features you'll see on your iPhone if you have iPhone 15 Pro, Pro Max or a device from the iPhone 16 lineup. Even if you have another iPhone, you'll still get new features, like an update to your Mail app.

Here are some of the features that landed on your iPhone with iOS 18.2. Note that before you use Apple Intelligence, you have to request it for your iPhone. To do so, go to Settings > Apple Intelligence & Siri and tap Get Apple Intelligence.

Apple announced at WWDC in May that its virtual assistant Siri was soon entering a "" new era "" thanks to Apple Intelligence enhancements. And Apple is bringing most of those enhancements to some iPhones with iOS 18.2.

With Apple Intelligence, instead of seeing a logo pop up on your screen when you activate Siri, you'll see a glowing light around your screen. You can use Siri like you normally would, and you can also access ChatGPT for your queries.

Whenever you're using an AI chatbot, remember that results may not be accurate and may vary even if you ask the same question twice. I asked Siri to use ChatGPT to show me how to brew a cup of coffee, and at first, it wrote out a seven-step process on how to make drip coffee in a standard brewer. Those instructions were a little wonky, telling me to measure out my water and coffee grounds before grinding my coffee beans. Another time, I asked the same thing and Siri gave me a five-step process, which was more accurate. There is a disclaimer at the bottom of these ChatGPT requests that reads, "" Check important info for mistakes. ""

You can also copy what Siri and ChatGPT show you by tapping a button in the top right corner of the window that shows two pieces of paper. Then, you can paste the response in a message or a note if you want -- but again, you should verify the details of your request.

There are over 3,000 emoji you can use, but sometimes you can't find the one you really want. Genmoji is here to help. With the Apple Intelligence Genmoji feature, you can describe the emoji you're looking for and iPhones with Apple Intelligence will attempt to generate a new emoji based on your description.

To use Genmoji, go into a message and tap the emoji keyboard in the bottom left corner of your keyboard. Then, type the emoji you're looking for into the search bar. If there isn't an emoji that matches your description, tap Create New Emoji just below the search bar. Your iPhone will then show you a few variations of what it came up with based on your description. You can swipe through the emoji, and when you find a Genmoji you like, tap Add in the top right corner to permanently add that new emoji to your keyboard.

This is Apple's answer to Google Lens. Visual Intelligence is an Apple Intelligence feature that lets you point your camera at something, like a dog, and your iPhone will then use the photo to search online to help you identify it. The feature can also be used to detect phone numbers to create contacts, scan QR codes and translate languages.

You can also integrate this feature with ChatGPT to help you identify items, as well as to help you better understand what's on a page or screen. Note that you don't need a ChatGPT account to use the integration.

This feature is also only available on the iPhone 16 lineup since it utilizes the series' new camera control side-button. If you have one of the new iPhones, long press the new side-button where the SIM card tray used to be to quickly pull up Visual Intelligence.

"" The camera control provides instant, easy access to the camera with just a click. It allows you to adjust various camera features simply by sliding your finger, "" Apple said at its Glowtime event in September. "" Its convenient design ensures it's always within reach. ""

This Apple Intelligence feature takes Genmoji one step further and lets you create whole images based on text prompts in a tool called Image Playground. This feature is a standalone app and it can also be found in Message by tapping the plus (+) button to the left of your text box.

Image Playground is filled with prompt suggestions, themes, places and more to get you started. You can enter multiple prompts to make the image more specific, but once I entered seven prompts a popup appeared telling me to use fewer. There's also an option to change the art style from the default cartoony 3D images to illustrations.

If you want to put yourself, friends, family or your pet into one of these images, you can. Tap the plus (+) sign in the bottom right corner and then tap either Choose Photo or Take Photo. You'll still have to choose or enter a prompt in addition to the photo.

The feature can create some simple images, and it can be unintentionally funny with how weird other images are. In one instance, I selected the prompts astronaut, artist and lighthouse. One of the results showed an astronaut leaning against what I Imagine is an invisible stool while painting a multicolor beach scene. But for some reason there's a lighthouse just floating in the background. Phenomenal work.

You can also draw a sketch in Notes, select your sketch and then use it with Visual Playground. That way you can either clean up your sketch, or if -- like me -- you're not an artist, you can use the feature to flesh out your sketch.

The Find My app can be used to locate things like your AirPods and MacBook, and with iOS 18.2, Apple makes it easy for everyone to get help finding lost items. If you go into Find My > Items and tap one of your items, you have two new options: Share Item Location and Show Contact Info.

If you enable Share Item Location, Find My will create a link that you can share with others so they can notify you if they find your lost or missing item. This could be especially helpful as we head into the holidays as more people are traveling and losing luggage at airports or leaving items behind. These links expire after one week, though, which may not be enough time to find them.

If you enable Show Contact Info, others can connect to lost items so they can find ways to contact you and bring your item back to you.

The Mail app on every iPhone also gets an upgrade in iOS 18.2. Apple announced in September that Mail would soon be able to sort emails to multiple categories to keep your important emails in one place and ads or promotions in another, like Gmail and Outlook do. The new layout keeps things mostly tidy, but Mail doesn't always get it right. For example, I found an email for digital tickets I previously ordered in the Promotions category rather than the Primary category.

You don't have to use the new layout if you don't want to. To change your Mail layout back, go into Mail, tap the three dots (...) in the top right corner and tap List View.

Apple previously removed the volume slider on the iPhone's lock screen. You could still use the volume buttons on the side of your iPhone, but it wasn't as precise as the slider. With iOS 18.2, you can add the slider back to your lock screen.

Go to Settings > Accessibility > Audio and Visual and tap the toggle next to Always Show Volume Control. Now, whether you're listening to a podcast or music from one of Apple's apps or a third-party app the volume slider will be present on your lock screen.

If you have kids who like to play games or watch videos on their iPhones and they set the music to full blast, that could damage their device's speakers -- not to mention that it could be annoying to you. But iOS 18.2 lets set a maximum volume limit on an iPhone.

To set a limit go to Settings > Sounds & Haptics > Volume Limit and tap the toggle next to Limit Maximum Volume. A scale will appear and you can select what you want the limit to be. Apple does note that this limit doesn't apply to things like phone calls, FaceTime calls, emergency calls or Find My sounds.

If you like using another messaging or email apps, like Signal or Gmail, over Apple's native apps, you can change your default apps to those other apps in iOS 18.2. Go to Settings > Apps > Default Apps and then you can change which apps your iPhone uses automatically for sending messages, emails, browsing the web and more.

Apple launched Apple News Plus in 2019. Since then the tech company has made some changes to its news aggregator service, like the addition of the Quartiles puzzles. With iOS 18.2, Apple is bringing Sudoku to Apple News Plus subscribers.

If you subscribe to Apple News Plus ($13 a month) go to News > Following > Puzzles to play the latest Sudoku puzzle. Every day Apple launches a few of these puzzles, each ranging in difficulty, so there's always a new brain-teaser to play.

If you have any phones from the iPhone 16 lineup, you have the Camera Control button. You have to press this twice to open your camera if your screen is asleep or inactive, but Apple introduced a new toggle in the iOS 18.2 so that you can press the Camera Control once to open your camera even if your screen is off.

To do this, go to Settings > Display & Brightness and tap the toggle next to Require Screen On to disable the feature. Now if you press the Camera Control while your screen is off, your iPhone will open your Camera without a second press. However, it could also lead to accidentally opening your camera more often.

Here are the full release notes for iOS 18.2.

The one MacBook feature that had everyone begging for change,"Summary

The Butterfly keyboard introduced in 2015 had major design flaws. Typists preferred the newer Magic keyboard over the Butterfly. Apple's newer M-series processors signal a new, more reliable era for MacBooks.

The Butterfly keyboard for Apple's MacBooks released between 2015 and 2020 proved to be one of the most controversial MacBook developments in Apple's history. Now, a few years after the fact, after Apple paid over $50M in a settlement related to the Butterfly keyboard, I've been re-thinking about what I consider the darkest era of MacBooks. The Butterfly keyboard was a keyboard I typed on for four years, which is also the same amount of time I've been typing on Apple's newer Magic keyboard. My question is this: is it really that much better, and was the Butterfly keyboard really that bad?

Keyboard preferences are something that varies from person to person. However, there was so much criticism surrounding the Butterfly keyboard, that it's nearly impossible to find writers who prefer it over the newer Magic keyboards. I went back and dug out my 2016 MacBook Air with a Butterfly keyboard and did some typing tests with it and then repeated those tests on my 2022 MacBook Pro with a Magic keyboard to see if I could tell the difference -- plus, here's the story of the Apple Butterfly keyboard.

2015: The introduction of the Butterfly keyboard

Introduced alongside the 12-inch MacBook

The MacBook 12-inch (note: not the ""Air"", or ""Pro"", just ""MacBook"") was released in 2015. It brought about a whole new design to the Apple MacBook lineup, with a new keyboard dubbed Butterfly, and a design that relied heavily on USB-C ports. It was an awkward Mac, not more powerful than the MacBook Air, and nowhere near the power of a MacBook Pro. It was incredibly small, and in turn, underpowered. It was also a bit too expensive, starting at a whopping $1200 when it was released. It just made more sense to buy a MacBook Air for most people, or go a step-up to the 13-inch MacBook Pro.

Anyone who has tried the 2015 MacBook 12-inch noticed immediately how thin the laptop was. It was the thinnest MacBook to date, and the primary reason for that thinness? The Butterfly keyboard. At first, there were a lot of benefits to the new butterfly keyboard. It kept size and weight down. The short key height made the key feel stable when you pressed down, meaning the entire key was uniform of feeling. You could hit the corner of a key, or the center of a key, and feel the same reaction.

However, these new design 'benefits' were double-edged swords. The short key design would cause tiny pieces of dirt or debris to prevent a key on the keyboard from working entirely. There also was no easy way to replace your keys. If you had a particular key issue with a Butterfly keyboard, it would require your MacBook to take a trip to an Apple repair center.

How the Butterfly key switch worked

A switch designed for thinness with the shape of a butterfly's wings

The switch used on the Butterfly keyboard that appeared with the 2015 MacBook was, itself, nothing new. The actual switch used in the Butterfly keyboard had been around since 2012, and was found in the MacBook Air series of Apple's flagship laptop. In earlier MacBook's, and in subsequent MacBook keyboards after the discontinuation of the Butterfly keyboard, Apple utilized what's called a 'scissor switch' underneath the keys.

The issue with laying the switch so close to the chassis was that if any debris came into the keyboard, it could make the switch inoperable.

The scissor switch takes its name from its mechanism and appearance, which looks like a pair of scissors closing and opening each time a key is pressed. This provides for a comfortable typing experience, but it also causes the key to be lifted off the chassis. The butterfly switch, on the other hand, used a switch mechanism that resembled a butterfly's wings, allowing the switch to rely nearly flat on the chassis. This particular aspect, of being laid so much closer to the chassis than the prior scissor switch, allowed Apple to focus on making MacBooks thinner than ever.

The issue with laying the switch so close to the chassis was that if any debris found its way into the keyboard, it could make the switch inoperable. Additionally, some critics worried that Apple was focusing more on thinness during this era, rather than usability. Another point of criticism that couldn't be dodged regarding the Butterfly keyboard was related to the travel distance of keys. The Butterfly keyboard featured an incredibly shallow 0.5mm travel distance.

A lower travel distance on keyboards typically relates to less pressure needed to register a key press. On the Butterfly keyboards, a simple glide over the keys could trigger key presses, but an adept typist should be able to adjust to this travel distance change. However, typically, on keyboards that are considered low travel, the travel distance typically ranges from 1.5 to 1.0mm.

The reaction to the Butterfly keyboard

Quiet suffering, followed by an article in 2017

Close

There wasn't much press regarding the Butterfly keyboard during its initial roll-out. The first major journalist to write about the problems that were becoming more and more apparent by 2017 with the Butterfly keyboard was Casey Jonston writing for The Outline. In the story, Jonston talks about a visit to a Manhattan Apple Store all because there was a piece of dust stuck under the spacebar of his MacBook. A small piece of dust was all it took to make the mighty MacBook inoperable. Apple, however, stuck with the Butterfly keyboard in the face of mounting criticism from both consumers and journalists, and made several attempts to tweak the many design flaws with the switch.

Apple did continue to atone for its Butterfly keyboard.

In 2018, Apple introduced a new repair program, which was the first time Apple acknowledged a problem with the Butterfly switch keyboard. While it's impossible to tell if the Butterfly keyboard contributed negatively to MacBook sales, Apple did continue to atone for its Butterfly keyboard. A year after the introduction of the repair program, in 2019, Apple issued an apology for issues relating to the Butterfly keyboard.

Apple also released several 'upgrades' to the Butterfly keyboard as time went on. In 2016, a so-called 'second generation' of the Butterfly keyboard was released. Later, in 2018, Apple added a silicone membrane to the Butterfly keyboard with the intention of preventing issues with dust disabling the keyboard. However, the silicone membrane was simply a band-aid, and not an elimination of the problem.

The Butterfly keyboard ultimately became a problem for Apple's reputation. Criticisms had abounded, as each new MacBook in the years of 2015-2019 didn't bring anything significant with regard to a hardware upgrade, and the response to the frustrating butterfly keyboard issues only intensified as Apple committed more and more to keeping the keyboard. It seemed like a grave the company decided to just keep digging.

Apple did introduce programs that allowed users to send in their MacBooks to repair the Butterfly keyboard, but once you got yours back and dust got into the keyboard again, you were out of luck. Ultimately, if you wanted to have an issue-free experience with a MacBook in this era, you were better off using an external keyboard, as long as it wasn't the external Butterfly keyboard sold by Apple.

A new era begins

A golden age began with M-series processors and the Magic keyboard

Close

While I think the Butterfly keyboard was one of Apple's darkest eras, the clouds parted and gave way to the shine of what I now believe may be Apple's golden era when it comes to MacBooks. First things first, the new Magic keyboards that were introduced first with the 16-inch MacBook Pro in 2020 feature scissor-style switches again, and have a higher travel distance at 1mm. I type on a MacBook Pro (2022) daily, and I love the keyboard, and when I went back and tried to type on a butterfly keyboard, my errors were out of control. There was a lot of speculation during the Butterfly keyboard era about the decline of Apple's Intel-based processors, and before the release of the Apple M1 processor there was an understandable amount of skepticism. Fortunately for both Apple and the rest of us, the M-series processors exceeded expectations and now get even better with every new generation .

Yes, the MacBook Pro isn't as thin as it used to be. But, it's more powerful, features an improved display, and a significantly more comfortable and less problematic keyboard. The newest MacBooks packing the M4 processors are a step ahead in nearly every category when it comes to processing power, and this time around, the keyboard isn't going to break the entire laptop next time a little bit of dust lands on your keyboard. The Magic keyboard is one of my absolute favorite keyboards across all laptops, and it makes writing on the MacBook Pro (2022) a dream.

While Apple's dark era of the Butterfly keyboard lasted nearly five years, we seem to be smooth sailing into a golden era, with thoughtful upgrades becoming more common.

To truly benefit from 5G, consumers ⁣need a smartphone specifically designed for the new network. These devices are equipped with specialized 5G modems and antennas that allow them to tap into the full⁤ potential of the technology.

so, how can you tell if your phone is 5G-ready?

most manufacturers clearly state 5G compatibility ⁢in their product descriptions and specifications. You can also check your phone's settings menu for information about network capabilities.

If your current phone isn't 5G-enabled, don't despair.There's a wide range of affordable and feature-packed 5G smartphones available on the market.

iOS 18.2 -- Update Now Warning Issued To All iPhone Users,"Update Dec. 13, 2024: This story, originally published Dec. 11, now includes details about a new CISA warning and an alert from researchers at security outfit Malwarebytes. A Dec. 12 update added information about the Passwords flaw patched in iOS 18.2, as well as other updates issued by Apple.

Apple has issued iOS 18.2, along with the first major Apple Intelligence features and 21 security updates you should apply to your iPhone now.

Many iPhone users will see iOS 18.2 as a reason to update to iOS 18 and the security fixes in this release should add to the incentive.

This indicates Apple is no longer giving you the option to stay on iOS 17 if you have a iOS 18-compatible device. If you remain on iOS 17, this means you will no longer be secure.

Apple doesn't give much detail about what's fixed in iOS 18.2, to give iPhone users as much time to update as possible before criminals can get hold of the details.

Among the issues fixed in iOS 18.2 are three Kernel flaws tracked as CVE-2024-54494, CVE-2024-54510 and CVE-2024-44245, the last of which could allow an app to cause unexpected system termination or corrupt Kernel memory, according to Apple's support page.

An issue in libexpat tracked as CVE-2024-45490 is particularly worrying, as it could see a remote attacker cause an unexpected app termination or execute code.

Apple's iOS 18.2 also patches two flaws in libxpc, one of which could see an app able to gain elevated privileges.

Four vulnerabilities in WebKit were fixed in iOS 18.2, allowing memory corruption if you were persuaded to interact with malicious web content.

A flaw in Passwords, tracked as CVE-2024-54492 and reported by researchers at Mysk, could also be a concern. Using the vulnerability patched in iOS 18.2, an attacker in a privileged network position could be able to alter network traffic, according to Apple's description.

The issue was addressed by using secure web protocol HTTPS when sending information over the network. ""Since iOS 18 launched, the new Passwords app has been using unencrypted HTTP to download icons for password entries -- a potential risk,"" Mysk researchers said.

Sean Wright, head of application security at Featurespace highlights the Passwords flaw seeing HTTP used instead of HTTPS as ""a bit of a concern.""

He advises ""updating as soon as you can,"" highlighting the benefits of the new Apple Intelligence features.

Alongside iOS 18.2 and iOS 17.7.3, Apple released Safari 18.2, fixing four WebKit issues and one Safari flaw. The iPhone maker also issued macOS Sequoia 15.2, macOS Sonoma 14.7.2, macOS Ventura 13.7.2, watchOS 11.2, tvOS 18.2 and visionOS 2.2.

As if there wasn't enough reason to update to iOS 18.2, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) has now entered the conversation with its own warning.

""Apple released security updates to address vulnerabilities in multiple Apple products,"" CISA wrote on its website. ""A cyber threat actor could exploit some of these vulnerabilities to take control of an affected system,"" the security agency added.

With this in mind, CISA is encouraging users and administrators to review the advisories issued for iOS 18.2 and other upgrades released by Apple on Dec. 11 and ""apply necessary updates.""

The CISA warning to update to iOS 18.2 is in addition to a new alert from researchers at security outfit Malwarebytes. The firm has alerted users that Apple has issued security patches for most of its operating systems, including iOS, Mac, iPadOS, Safari, and visionOS. Pieter Arntz, malware intelligence researcher at Malwarebytes is advising users to upgrade their software now.

He describes the vulnerability in the open-source XML parser libexpat tracked as CVE-2024-45490 as a ""noteworthy"" flaw is. ""This vulnerability has been patched in several popular applications since it was discovered in August,"" Arntz wrote in the blog.

Another ""important one"" is the vulnerability tracked as CVE-2024-54529, which is found in the Audio component of macOS and could allow an app to execute arbitrary code with Kernel privileges, Antz warned. ""This means that if you install a malicious app that can exploit this vulnerability, it could take over your system.""

A scary thought.

Malwarebytes also advises you to turn on Automatic Updates if you haven't already, which you can do on the Software Update screen. However, be aware that Apple rolls out its updates gradually so you can be waiting a number of days to receive important upgrades. Therefore I suggest checking your iPhone and my Forbes profile and applying them manually.

The security updates alone and the fact you can't stay on iOS 17 and remain secure should be enough to persuade you to update now to iOS 18.2. But Apple's iOS 18.2 also includes a number of very cool features, including the ability to use OpenAI's ChatGPT, which is now integrated with Siri for the first time.

Apple's iOS 18.2 is available for iPhone XS and later, iPad Pro 13-inch, iPad Pro 12.9-inch 3rd generation and later, iPad Pro 11-inch 1st generation and later, iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 7th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later.

So, what are you waiting for? Go to your Settings > General > Software Update and upgrade to iOS 18.2 as soon as you can.",Forbes,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2024/12/13/ios-182-update-now-warning-issued-to-all-iphone-users/,2024-12-13,
"I review iPhones, and these are the iPhone 16 models I'd pick as gifts","Chances are you've got an iPhone fan in your life, and because they've been good this year -- very, very good, as a matter of fact -- you've been thinking of getting them an iPhone 16 this year as a present. And why not? Any list of the best phones available is going to include some model of the iPhone 16 at or near the top. Most of us who review phones are agreed that Apple outdid itself this year, so the iPhone 16 would be an ideal gift for someone who needs a new handset.

The only question is, which iPhone it should be?

On the bright side, you can't really go wrong with any model, as all four of the latest iPhones are excellent devices that share many features in common. Your gift-giving budget will play a part in determining which iPhone 16 model is the right one to gift, but other factors -- screen size, features and battery life -- all come into play. Suddenly, picking out the best iPhone doesn't sound so easy.

Fortunately, I've had the opportunity to look at the different iPhone 16 models since their release this fall, and I can also talk to the Tom's Guide reviewers who have spent even more time with the phones to get their impressions of each different device. As a result, I'm pretty confident I can tell you who should get which type model and why the best iPhone for one person may be an entirely different version for someone else.

Let's hand out some iPhone 16 models, shall we?

Why you should get this iPhone: The iPhone 16 Pro Max is the best of the best, with a top-performing A18 Pro chip and the best phone battery life of any iPhone we've ever tested. The cameras are as good as ever, topping phones like the Galaxy S24 Ultra in our 200-photo face-off. Apple even increased the size of the screen to 6.9 inches, giving you more space to work with when you're out and about.

Why you should think twice: For most of us, money very much is an object, and spending at least $1,199 -- the iPhone 16 Pro Max's starting price -- on a gift runs the risk of crossing over from ""extravagant"" to ""buys professional sports teams on a whim."" On a more practical level, if your recipients struggles to use larger phones, that 6.9-inch iPhone is very difficult to operate with just one hand.

Who should receive this iPhone as a gift: Demanding gamers, mobile device power users and anyone who takes the lede on shooting photos and videos at family get-togethers will appreciate receiving the iPhone 16 Pro Max as a gift. The high-quality cameras make this an obvious choice for anyone who treats mobile photography as more than a hobby, and the epic battery life means that people on the go don't have to break stride to look for a ay to charge up their phone.

Why you should get this iPhone: Last year, the iPhone 15 Pro vs. iPhone 15 Pro Max divide was substantial, but with the iPhone 16 Pro adopting the 5x optical zoom found on the Pro Max, Apple's Pro models are back on level terms. The biggest difference remains the screen size, but some of us -- like me -- find more compact phones like the Pro easier to handle. Even then, Apple did increase the size of the iPhone 16 Pro's display to 6.3 inches, so you still get ample screen space for streaming and gaming.

Why you should think twice: At $999, the iPhone 16 Pro is certainly less expensive than the iPhone 16 Pro Max, but it's still not an inexpensive phone. Besides the screen size, you're also compromising on battery life, though to be fair, the iPhone 16 Pro's 14-hour plus time is still 4 hours better than the average smartphone, even if it lags the Pro Max by 3.5 hours.

Who should receive this iPhone as a gift: The same folks who would enjoy an iPhone 16 Pro Max would also enjoy the iPhone 16 Pro, provided the smaller screen and less robust battery life aren't deal killers. With the same A18 Pro chipset and camera setup as the Pro Max, the iPhone 16 Pro can do just about anything its bigger sibling can handle will leaving $200 extra in your pocket to spend on other gifts.

Why you should get this iPhone: Apple has spent years trying to distinguish its Pro phones from the standard iPhone by favoring the former with more features. With the iPhone 16, though, the gap with the Pro models doesn't close completely, but it's a lot more narrow than its been. In fact, my colleague John Velasco believes the iPhone 16 puts an end to the Pro envy that people owning the standard model might feel, as they also have a phone with features like Action and Camera Control buttons. The A18 chipset inside the iPhone 16 delivers pretty strong performance, too.

Why you should think twice: Because the A18 lacks an extra GPU core found in the A18 Pro silicon, the iPhone 16 Pro is a better option for gamers who favor graphically intense games (though the iPhone 16 can hold its own with more conventional games). Another strike against the iPhone 16 -- it has the worst battery life of the new models, though its 12 hour and 43 minute result on our test is an above average result compared to all the phones we've tested.

Who should receive this iPhone as a gift: All but the most demanding iPhone users would be happy with the iPhone 16 as a gift. It performs well, and its cameras are top-notch even without a dedicated telephoto lens. (The 48MP main camera can pull double-duty capturing 2x zooms that mimic optical zoom quality.) With stylish colors and a compact design, this is a satisfying device that delivers more than what you normally would expect from an entry-level offering.

Why you should get this iPhone: Since Apple first started coming out with a Plus model with the iPhone 14 lineup, there have been two reasons to turn to this phone -- it lets you enjoy a big-screen iPhone without paying Pro Max prices, and the battery life on this model tends to be superlative. That's the case once again with the iPhone 16 Plus, as it lasted around 16.5 hours on our test.

Why you should think twice: The Plus and Pro Max used to feature the same screen size, which made a compelling case of the cheaper big-screen iPhone. But with the iPhone 16 Pro Max swelling to 6.9 inches while the iPhone 16 Plus sticks at 6.7 inches, fans of super-sized displays may feel like they're getting short-changed with this model.

Who should receive this iPhone as a gift: The iPhone 16 Plus is still the phone to get for anyone who appreciates a big display but doesn't need the extra bells and whistles (like a telephoto lens) that drive up the iPhone 16 Pro Max's cost. You still get very good cameras with the iPhone 16 Plus and performance that equals what you get from the standard iPhone.

Apple keeps older devices in its lineup, reducing the prices whenever a new family of iPhones comes along. Right now, both the iPhone 15 and iPhone 14 remain available, in both standard and Plus versions.

Usually, older models represent a good bargain, given that they cost less than the iPhones Apple just released. In that sense, you could pick up a discounted iPhone as the very first phone for a teenager, without having to worry about them smashing up a $799-and-higher handset.

But there's a complication this year. Apple introduced AI-powered Apple Intelligence features to its phones via the iOS 18.1 software update in October. Apple Intelligence brings a revamped Siri to the iPhone as well as new tools like an image editing feature to remove distracting background objects from photos and writing tools that let you fine-tune and proofread anything you've written.

Sounds great, right? It can be... but it's not available to every iPhone that can run iOS 18. Instead, you need a device that features an A17 Pro or higher chip to take advantage of Apple Intelligence. And none of the iPhone 14 or iPhone 15 models available through Apple have the necessary horsepower. You'd need at least an iPhone 15 Pro to get something out of Apple Intelligence -- and Apple doesn't sell that phone any more, at a discount or otherwise. (You might have more luck, searching for an iPhone 15 Pro at a phone carrier, but if you do, make sure you get the phone at a discount from its original $999 price.)

That's not to say that you should ignore these phones. At a reduced price of $699, the iPhone 15 is a very good deal on a still capable phone. But know that if you go that route, whoever is on the receiving end of that device won't be experiencing any Apple Intelligence features.

Our low-cost iPhone discussion above excluded the iPhone SE, which seems like a glaring admission since that's the cheapest phone in Apple's lineup. At $429, it, too, would seem like a great gift for someone angling for their first phone. And it is... provided you know what you're missing out on.

We're not just talking about the extra lenses -- the iPhone SE has just one rear camera -- or the fact that there's no night mode support for low-light photos. Rather, it's that rumors indicate a new iPhone SE will arrive next year, with most people pointing to a spring release. What's more, the iPhone SE 4 is said to be adopting a more modern design. And depending on which chip Apple uses, the new phone could include Apple Intelligence support -- something missing from Apple's current crop of low-cost options.

Just because this iPhone you're considering is a gift doesn't mean you want to get stuck paying full price. Peruse our round-up of the best iPhone 16 deals to see if you can find a lower price on any of the iPhones we've mentioned.

The iPhone 16 models are new enough to the point where you're not going to find a lot of price drops. But if you turn to your wireless carrier, you may be able to significantly reduce the cost of your iPhone 16 by opening a new line of data or getting your service through an unlimited data plan.

Verizon customers, for example, can get an iPhone 16 Pro for free when they open a new line of data and sign up for the Unlimited Ultimate plan. That's Verizon's most expensive unlimited data plan at $90/month, so if that doesn't appeal to you, the carrier also has an iPhone 16 offer, where that phone comes free when you open a new line on the $80/month Unlimited Plus plan.

Similarly, AT&T has a deal where you can get the iPhone 16 for free with a trade-in; you also need to sign up for an eligible unlimited data plan with the carrier.

Both AT&T and Verizon spread your credits for your free device over 36 months, so you either have to stick with the carrier or be on the hook for whatever remains on the balance of your free iPhone. If you're willing to make that kind of commitment, your iPhone 16 gift may have just paid for itself.",Tom's Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/iphones/i-review-iphones-and-these-are-the-iphone-16-models-id-pick-as-gifts,2024-12-13,

iOS 18.2 LIVE  --  latest Apple Intelligence features and how to use them,"When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.

The iOS 18.2 rollout is underway as Apple finally brings the second wave of Apple Intelligence features to compatible iPhone, iPad and Mac devices. This includes several major new integrations, like the seriously impressive Visual Intelligence tool.

It's also a significant update for iPhone users in the U.K., Australia and a few other countries outside the U.S. who will now be able to access the AI features without needing to set their devices to US English.

Apple Intelligence is undoubtedly the headline act but as a reminder, it's only compatible with iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max and the iPhone 16 series of phones. For the record, here's why it's worth upgrading your iPhone to get access.

But that doesn't mean iOS 18.2 isn't a bumper upgrade for all Apple users -- noteworthy non-AI features include an update to Find My that lets you share AirTag locations with trusted friends or the option to view fullscreen videos in the redesigned Photos app.

The nature of software rollouts mean they won't hit everyone all at once, but we're following along with the update process live -- as well as calling out some of our favorite features below -- so you can stay updated with the latest changes you're getting on your iPhone, iPad or Mac.

Apple Intelligence is Apple's tightly integrated suite of AI solutions that will touch almost all areas of your iPhone. Here are some of the best new features you're going to want to try out as soon as you've updated.

The first thing you're going to want to know is how do you actually get the iOS 18.2 update on your iPhone? Luckily, the process couldn't be simpler. The most efficient way to make sure you're in line to get it is to turn on automatic updates in your iPhone's Setting menu. Simply go to Settings > General > Software Update on a compatible device.

If you want a full step-by-step breakdown, we've got you covered. Just follow our how-to guide here which includes screenshots walking you through the process.

Genmoji is a brilliant addition to the Apple ecosystem. It uses AI image generation technology for the specific purpose of letting users craft their own custom emojis. You can then send them in a chat as an emoji reaction, sticker or tapback.

There are now hundreds of different emojis available through the emoji keyboard, but with Genmoji you don't need to find one, or even a combination, that fit your requirements -- you can just make exactly what you want. For example, craft a slice of pizza with bananas on top or an emoji version of yourself playing guitar.

Available on any device capable of running Apple Intelligence, the genmoji is generated entirely 'on device', meaning no information is sent out to the cloud. Your phone, laptop or iPad does all the hard work which also makes it much faster and accessible.

There are limitations though as Apple has implemented guardrails preventing the creation of potentially harmful genmojis. Basically, if it wouldn't be available on a normal emoji keyboard then you probably can't generate it using Genmoji.

Visual intelligence is one of the most exciting features of Apple Intelligence coming through with iOS 18.2. It's Apple's answer to the likes of Google Lens and is only available on the iPhone 16 series where it can be accessed directly from the Camera Control button.

All you have to do is point your camera at something you want to learn about and click the shutter. You'll know Apple Intelligence is working because you'll see a rainbow-colored flash.

Once you have the image captured, Visual Intelligence will tell you things like opening hours for a shop, reviews for a cafe or even what a sign in a foreign language says. While you can typically do this with an old fashioned image search, the seamless interaction of Visual Intelligence with your iPhone's camera will hugely speed up this process.

Finally, if you snap a picture of something with a lot of text in it, Visual Intelligence can generate a quick summary for you to help save time.

Apple Intelligence is a pretty seismic shift in how you use your iPhone but, crucially, not everyone is going to get it with iOS 18.2. There are both device and region limitations to be aware of.

Cupertino's suite of AI enhancements will be available on the following devices: iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, iPhone 16 Pro Max, iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, any iPad with A17 Pro or M1 and later, and any Mac with an M1 chip and later.

When we're talking about iPad and Mac, those enhancements come with iPadOS 18.2 and macOS Sequoia 15.2 which are also rolling out today.

There's a caveat in place for anyone reading this in the EU -- while Apple Intelligence will roll out for the Mac in that region, it won't become available on iPhone or iPad for several months yet. Apple says it will be giving EU iPhone and iPad users access to Writing Tools, Genmoji, a redesigned Siri with richer language understanding, ChatGPT integration, and more from April 2025.

For anyone reading this outside of an English-speaking country, Apple Intelligence can be accessed in most regions around the world when the device and Siri language are set to localized English for the following regions: Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, the U.K., or the U.S.

Image Playground does something special that only Apple can do at this scale. It is fine-tuning an AI image model on your own pictures. This is known as personal context and its possible because it happens entirely on-device.

Your phone, tablet or laptop are doing all the hard work in analyzing your images, describing you and your family and then creating something new based on that detail.

It is an incredibly fun way to create personalized stickers to send in the group chat, build your own custom memes and otherwise generate images with a personal touch.

Available as a standalone app or from within Messages, Image Playground pictures come in two styles: Cartoon and Illustration. There's no photorealism, in part because that would over-tax the capabilities of a phone, but also because it allows Apple to reduce the potential for misuse.

It is one of those Apple Apps that you don't really ""get"" until you try it, and once you've tried it it'll likely become one of your favorites.

We've covered Apple Intelligence a fair bit on Tom's Guide, but we're not the only ones excited by the potential of this new technology. Over at the Wall Street Journal, Joanna Stern has given her thoughts in an in-depth Apple Intelligence review with the title ""The AI Apple Promised Us"".

You can read it for yourself here but Stern's take is similar to my own feeling on Apple Intelligence: it makes the iPhone 16 what was promised to us back in September.

What's interesting is that the WSJ isn't convinced a software update alone is enough to get people to upgrade their device. I'm not sure I agree. We know that users are holding onto their phones for longer and with seemingly ever-more-incremental hardware upgrades happening, the big draw to update your iPhone in future could well depend on large scale software improvements like Apple Intelligence.

To use Apple Intelligence in iOS 18.1, you had to have your device set to U.S. English. That's fine but not ideal if you speak a different flavor (or flavour if you prefer) of English, and could be tricky if English is not your native language.

Fortunately, among its upgrade iOS 18.2 allows devices using Australian, Canadian, Irish, New Zealand, South African and U.K. English to work with Apple Intelligence. Sadly beyond that, other languages are still only due to arrive between now and April 2025.

If you want to switch languages to take advantage of Apple Intelligence, you can use this guide.

Perhaps one of the biggest talking points in iOS 18.2 that I'm most excited for is the fact that ChatGPT itself will now be integrated with your iPhone.

It needs to be enabled manually, but with the feature switched on, ChatGPT will be able to take care of things that Siri can't alone, like generating text with Writing Tools. You can also log-in with your own account if you wish so you can access your ChatGPT Plus subscription if you have one.

ChatGPT also helps with Visual Intelligence on iPhone 16. The ""Ask"" function directs your requests through the chatbot to hopefully teach you more about what's in front of you.

Siri tends to take something of a beating when we talk about which virtual assistant is the best, but you're going to notice several changes once you've updated to iOS 18.2 that make it far more helpful.

For starters, Siri is now able to talk with a more conversational tone, and is better at understanding what you're asking. Better still it can remember what you've asked before, and continue conversations regardless of how many other requests you make in the interim.

Oh, and those requests can be made by typing, rather than forcing you to use your voice. If you want to get the best from Siri after you've installed your update, try these seven prompts first.

Today's update will also introduce Apple's Writing Tools, a suite of AI-driven features that enhance writing and communication. These tools offer functionalities such as grammar and spelling checks, tone adjustments, and sentence rewrites, directly integrated into Apple's ecosystem.

This development positions Apple Intelligence as a direct competitor to established services like Grammarly. Yet, with Apple Intelligence, users don't have to add any external writing tool apps because everything they need works seamlessly across Apple products.

Apple Intelligence in iOS 18.2 will provide comprehensive grammar correction, stylistic refinement, and tone adjustments regardless across multiple platforms. Open a Google Doc or email on your phone and start writing with the assistance of Apple AI. This is going to be very useful.

Philip Michaels here. I'm the managing editor for mobile at Tom's Guide, and I'll be taking over for Jeff Parsons the rest of the way. And now that we've talked about what features are available via the iOS 18.2 update, let's talk about how to use them.

Let's start with Image Playground, which is probably the feature people are most excited about. We've got a step-by-step guide on how to use Image Playground, but the TLDR; version is that you'll launch the app and be immediately greeted by a text field where you can enter in the image you want to see. There's also some suggestions on various objects, themes and backgrounds to use in your generated image if you need help coming up with a prompt or fine-tuning your creation.

My advice to you after using the app is to make a lot of adjustments to your image, either by adding more to your prompt or removing the parts of the prompt that don't quite work.

During the iOS 18.2 beta, you had to first sign up with Apple to use Image Playground, and you could only get started with the app once you were approved. In my experience, that took a couple of days. I don't know if that will continue now that iOS 18.2 is out of beta, but it's something to bear in mind when firing up Image Playground for the first time.

The arrival of ChatGPT on your iPhone is a pretty big deal, so you're going to want to get started with it right away. Here's our guide on how to use ChatGPT in iOS 18.2, including pointers on to set it up and how it integrates with features like Siri and Visual Intelligence.

Apple Intelligence features don't work on every iPhone that can run iOS 18, as you probably know. But there's at least one Apple Intelligence feature that won't work on every iPhone that supports Apple Intelligence.

We're talking about Visual Intelligence, Apple's answer to Google Lens, which is limited to the four new iPhone 16 models. But if you happen to be an iPhone 16 owner upgrading to iOS 18.2, you'll want to read our step-by-step guide on how to use Visual Intelligence with your new iPhone.

We're focusing on Apple Intelligence here for obvious reasons, but sometimes it helps to take a step back and look at the entire iOS 18 update to grasp just how many changes Apple has made. Our iOS 18 hub is now updated to reflect the new features introduced by iOS 18.2 -- you might find it a handy reference for all the big changes that have come to your iPhone in the last few months.

As someone who doesn't really use the emoji that already exist, I'm pretty sure that Genmoji -- Apple's generative imaging feature to create custom emoji through text prompts -- is not going to be something I turn to in iOS 18.2. But plenty of the rest of you seem to be emoji-crazy, so Genmoji is probably going to be one of the first things you try.

If so, you'll want to read our guide on how to use Genmoji, which walks you through the process of creating your very own emoji for just the right situation.

I had the chance to test Image Playground as part of the iOS 18.2 beta. My verdict: while the images the app creates are certainly fun, the tool feels very limited at the moment. There are just two styles at the moment -- animation and illustration -- and that inevitably means your output starts looking the same the more you use Image Playground.

I also wish you could do more with images once you've generated them. Right now, your output seems to be limited to ones that you can share in Messages or paste into a Note, but that's about it.

Your mileage may vary, of course, so we'd love to hear about what you wind up using Image Playground to create.

Apple Intelligence is the focus of iOS 18.2, but it's not the only source of changes in this software update. Among the changes available to all iPhones that run iOS 18 are some tweaks to the Photos app, which should make it easier to customize the look of things.

With iOS 18.2, you can now sort albums alphabetically. You're also able to clear the history in the Recently Viewed and Recently Shared albums. Additional improvements include the ability to scrub frame-by-frame when you're viewing videos and to turn off auto-looping video in the Settings app.

Whenever there's an update to Apple's iPhone software as hefty as iOS 18.2 is, I typically go and update my review of the operating system. That's why I've just finished the update to my iOS 18 review, accounting for the new Apple Intelligence features and some of the other changes Apple has made with this update.

My assessment hasn't changed that much since iOS 18.1 -- the Apple Intelligence additions are significant steps in Apple's move to include more AI-powered capabilities in its devices, though it remains a work in progress. Some tools are quite useful -- summaries for example -- while others need a bit more polish. (I refer you to my Image Playground criticism from earlier.) The biggest step forward will be a more context-aware Siri, but I don't imagine that's going to be complete until next year.

Some AI features can feel like gimmicks, but that doesn't seem to be the case with Visual Intelligence, where you can use both the camera on your iPhone and AI to look up information. Here's a look at one of the practical uses of that capability -- using Visual Intelligence to count calories in the food you eat.

OpenAI, which makes ChatGPT, is understandably excited about the integration of its AI model with iOS 18.2. That was the focus of today's installment of OpenAI's 12 days of announcements. And we've got a look at what OpenAI had to say about ChatGPT and Siri.",Yahoo,https://www.yahoo.com/tech/ios-18-2-live-latest-133942510.html,2024-12-12,
iPhone users say Apple's iOS 18.2 update is RUINING their battery life,"It's been a torturous wait for millions of eager Apple fans, but the firm's new operating system, iOS 18.2, is finally here.

Released on Wednesday, iOS 18.2 finally brings Apple Intelligence - Apple's fancy suite of AI features - to iPhones in the UK following an October release in the US.

Apple Intelligence includes helpful features like AI-generated emoji, image editing and a ChatGPT-powered version of smart assistant Siri.

However, several early users have taken to X (Twitter) to complain that the update is draining their battery life.

One user said: 'I downloaded 18.2 and it really killed my battery I had 70% now down to 34% usually my phone doesn't drain this fast.'

Someone then replied: 'Same here bro. My Plus has an amazing battery life but still it drains over 25% battery overnight after 18.2.

'As an iPhone user since 2011 I really switch to Android next time. At this point, there is no reason to be on iOS. Lack of innovation, killing a year old device.'

Here's what to do if your device is affected by 'battery drain'.

iOS 18.2 finally brings Apple Intelligence to the UK - but the update appears to be draining people's phone batteries (file photo)

Several early users have taken to X ( Twitter ) to complain that the iOS 18.2 update is draining their battery life

'Apple is not slapping anymore': Apple releases major iOS versions (e.g. iOS 18) in September with additional updates following throughout the year (e.g. iOS 18.2)

Battery drain is when a phone uses up more power than it usually would, meaning the device has to be charged more often or even kept plugged in.

The issue tends to happen after an iOS update because of the intensive recalibration tasks that require extra power.

Another X user said: 'iOS 18.1.1 decimated the battery life of my iPhone15 Pro. Installed 18.2 today, and now it literally drains faster than it charges while it lays unused on my desk. WTH @apple?'

A fourth person posted: 'Terrible battery drain on ios 18.2 after being unbelievably good on 18.1.'

A fifth said: 'iOS 18 have been draining battery ever since launch and you haven't solved that even in iOS 18.2. Apple is not slapping anymore.'

However, other users seemed to have been unaffected, with one posting: 'iOS 18.2 update has been pretty good so far. Solid battery life!'

If you're one of those to have noticed battery drain after updating, the first thing to do is be patient because the change should only be temporary.

Sometimes it can take hours and even days for software changes to finalise, which means that battery health can plummet or fluctuate.

One user said: 'I downloaded 18.2 and it really killed my battery I had 70% now down to 34% usually my phone doesn't drain this fast'

This user criticised Apple for 'lack of innovation' and threatened to switch to an Android phone

'If you notice that your battery life has decreased after updating your iPhone, wait a few days and then check again,' Apple says.

'Even though you can use your iPhone immediately after an update, certain tasks related to the update continue in the background and might affect battery life and thermal performance.'

However, if issues last for longer, it may be a good idea to check your phone battery's maximum capacity, located in the Battery tab in Settings.

An iPhone's capacity to hold charge decreases as the battery chemically ages, which may result in fewer hours of usage and worse performance between charges.

If your battery needs replacing, an 'important battery message' will pop up indicating that its health has significantly degraded.

Users should also check if Wi-Fi Assist setting is switched on, which keeps devices connected to the internet when the Wi-Fi connection is poor but can drain battery too.

If you're yet to get iOS 18.2 - and aren't deterred by the prospect of battery drain - your iPhone should alert you that the new update is available.

iPhone users can download iOS 18.2 by going to the Settings app, clicking 'General' and then 'Software Updates' before following on-screen instructions.

Apple's new iPhone 16 comes in much more pastel and vibrant colors than previous models

iOS 18.2 is available on iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, as well as iPhone 11, iPhone 12, iPhone 13, iPhone 14, iPhone 15 and the new iPhone 16, plus the iPhone SE 2 and 3 and some iPads and Mac computers.

However, only the very latest iPhones get Apple Intelligence on iOS 18.2 because of the special processing power required.

Apple Intelligence needs an up-to-date AI chip in a device to run - so the A17 Pro (in iPhones) or the M1 or later (in iPads and Macs).

iPhones that get Apple Intelligence are the full iPhone 16 series and the two top-end iPhone 15 models - iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max.

iPhone 16, starting at $799/£799, comes in two display sizes - 6.1 inches, and 6.7 inches for the Plus model (which costs £899/$899).

Meanwhile the two most expensive options - the Pro and Pro Max - respectively have 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch displays and cost £999/$999 and £1,199/$1,199.

Apple Intelligence: The best features

Apple Intelligence is essentially a snazzy brand name for Apple's new-found focus on AI, triggered by the huge success of the ChatGPT.

Here's a look at some of the best features of Apple Intelligence, which comes to the UK via the new iOS 18.2 operating system.

ChatGPT-Siri integration

Surely the biggest part of Apple Intelligence is the integration of OpenAI's hugely popular chatbot ChatGPT with Siri, Apple's in-built virtual assistant.

With better 'language-understanding capabilities' enabled by ChatGPT, Siri will help you across multiple apps and 'accelerate everyday tasks', Apple said.

You'll be able to press and hold the side button to activate Siri as normal, but with ChatGPT behind it Siri will be able to 'answer thousands of questions about how to do something' that it couldn't before.

iOS 18 users will be asked before any questions are sent to ChatGPT, along with any documents or photos, and Siri then presents the answer

For example, you could say, 'Play that podcast that Jamie recommended' and Siri will locate and play the episode, without the user having to remember whether it was mentioned in a text or an email.

Or you could ask, 'When is mum's flight landing?' and Siri will find the flight details and cross-reference them with real-time flight tracking to give an arrival time.

AI-generated emoji

If you can never quite find the emoji you're looking for during chat conversations, Apple has the answer.

One of the more fun parts of Apple Intelligence is AI-generated emoji, which Apple has called 'Genmoji' (a mix of 'generated' and 'emoji').

In the Messages app, you can type a short description of the emoji you want - such as 'smiley relaxing wearing cucumbers' or 'squirrel DJ'.

AI-generated emoji: In the Messages app, users can type a short description (e.g. 'smiley relaxing wearing cucumbers') to get a unique emoji to send to someone

Similar to AI tools that just need a few words to create weird artworks, from that single prompt Genmoji returns an AI-generated approximation of what you had in mind.

If you don't like what the AI has made for you, there are a few back-up options for you to choose from.

Clean Up

Apple's Clean Up tool for the Photos app makes ultra-clean edits to photos - without any telltale signs that the snap has been tampered with in any way.

It lets users remove 'distracting objects' from the background of a photo - for example a photobomber in the background of a family snap.

Clean Up is very similar to Google's photo-editing technology 'Magic Eraser' for its Pixel phones, heavily promoted in Google adverts in recent years.

The new Clean Up tool in Apple's Photos app can identify and remove 'distracting objects' in the background of a photo

But the technology has been described by some as 'Orwellian' as it can distort reality and 'create a false memory'.

Referring to Clean Up, one commenter said it 'can be misused' because it 'makes deleting evidence easy'.

Image Playground

AI also powers a new image-generating tool called 'Image Playground', which is available on multiple apps, including Messages and Pages.

With Image Playground, users can create images in a few seconds, choosing from three styles - 'animation', 'illustration' and 'sketch'.

Image Playground allows users to create fun images in seconds, choosing from three styles - Animation, Illustration and Sketch

A promo image appears to show a photo of a person being turned into a video game-style 3D avatar wearing a spacesuit in the 'animation' setting.

Rather like Genmoji, this 'exciting' image creation tool will help iPhone owners 'communicate and express themselves in new ways', the company says.

Movie Memories

The vast media storage capabilities of an iPhone means its always tempting to look back through your photos and video for a burst of nostalgia.

Recognizing this, Apple has come up with 'Movie Memories', an AI tool that creates the perfect home movie to watch on your device.

By typing a short description - for example 'last summer in our garden' - the AI can search your media library and and arrange photos and clips into a movie 'with its own narrative arc'.

Movie Memories picks out the best photos and videos based on a user's description and arranges it all into a movie with its own narrative arc

And as no movie is quite as good without a bit of music, you'll get song suggestions from Apple Music to match the memory.

Again, Apple stresses the privacy aspect of using an AI to search through your private life.

'As with all Apple Intelligence features, user photos and videos are kept private on device and are not shared with Apple or anyone else,' it says.

AI writing tools

Using AI to make your writing extra concise is not a new thing - for example Microsoft's Copilot AI is creating first drafts and suggesting edits in Word.

But now Apple is jumping on the bandwagon with its own AI-powered writing tools.

The tech will rewrite, proofread and summarize text on multiple apps, including Mail, Notes and Pages, as well as some third-party apps.

'Whether tidying up class notes, ensuring a blog post reads just right, or making sure an email is perfectly crafted, Writing Tools help users feel more confident in their writing,' the firm says.",Daily Mail Online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-14184909/iPhone-Apple-iOS-18-2-RUINING-battery-life.html,2024-12-12,
iOS 18.2 launches today: Here are all the new features - 9to5Mac,"iOS 18.2 is rolling out to iPhone users today. The update includes major new Apple Intelligence features, upgrades to the Camera Control on iPhone 16, a redesign for the Mail app, and much more. Head below for the full details on all the new iOS 18.2 and iPadOS 18.2 features.

iOS 18.2 will roll out to the general public today. You can check for the update by going to the Settings app, choosing General, and then choosing Software Update. If you don't see iOS 18.2 as an option right away, keep checking over the course of the day.

iOS 18.2 is available to all iPhones capable of running iOS 18. Apple Intelligence features are limited to iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and all iPhone 16 models.

The big change in iOS 18.2 is the addition of new Apple Intelligence features, including Genmoji, Image Playground, ChatGPT integration, and more.

For iPhone 16 users, iOS 18.2 continues to refine the functionality and features of the Camera Control. Most notably, the update brings Visual Intelligence. This feature can be activated by long-pressing the Camera Control. Then, you can point your iPhone's camera at something to learn more about it.

iOS 18.2 brings a major redesign to the Mail app that sorts your messages into four different categories:

If you disagree with how the Mail app has categorized a specific email, you can manually recategorize it, and that preference will be saved for future emails from that sender.

The update brings a new ""digest view"" that shows all emails from a specific business. You can also show notification badges only for unread messages in the ""Primary"" category.

iOS 18 introduced a dramatic redesign to the Photos app, and iOS 18.2 makes a few changes to that new design based on user feedback. Here's how Apple says it has addressed that feedback in iOS 18.2:

iOS 18.2 makes some big changes to the Find My app. Now, you can share the location of a misplaced AirTag or other Find My item by generating a link.

That link can be shared with others to help you find the lost item. People can access a website displaying the item's location on an interactive map using the link. The website automatically updates with new locations and includes timestamps for the most recent updates.

Apple has also announced it is teaming up with more than 15 airlines to implement systems to accept location links to help locate lost luggage.

The iOS 18.2 release notes also tout new features for Safari, including new customization options and a Live Activity for

In addition to these major new features and changes, iOS 18.2 also includes a ton of smaller updates. Here's a full breakdown:

Apple also outlines two bug fixes included in iOS 18.2:

iOS 18.1 introduced the world to Apple Intelligence with useful new features like Writing Tools, notification summaries, a new design for Siri, and new summarization and priority features in the Mail app. iOS 18.2, however, builds upon that foundation. It also includes Apple's first foray into image generation technology.

Genmoji is the standout feature in iOS 18.2. It makes it fun and easy to quickly create an emoji of anything. One of the best parts of Genmoji is how well it's integrated into the keyboard. For example, if you search for an emoji that is not available, you'll have the option to instantly create one with Genmoji based on your description.

Image Playground is another feature of Apple Intelligence that stands out thanks to its deep integration with iOS. Image Playground is available as a standalone app and integrated into other places, such as messages.

Image Playground creations aren't the most groundbreaking images you can generate using artificial intelligence. They are, however, easy, fun, and quick to create. Image Playground can also tap into your Photos library to create pictures based on your friends and family. I've found it to be a fun feature that strikes a great balance of image quality and speed.

Plus, all Image Playground and Genmoji creations are generated directly on device without cloud processing.

With iOS 18.2, you can also now tap into ChatGPT through Siri. I've found this to be a useful fallback for when Siri fails to answer a question properly. You can access ChatGPT through Siri without signing into an OpenAI account, and no record of your conversations will be kept. Your IP address is also obscured.

Optionally, you can sign into your ChatGPT account to unlock higher usage limits. If you choose to sign in, your usage falls under ChatGPT's data-use policies. When signed in to your ChatGPT account, your requests are saved to your chat history so you can access them later.

Apple has struck a great balance of integrating ChatGPT into Siri while also maintaining its own stance on privacy. It's useful to have ChatGPT as an option for additional world knowledge when talking to Siri, but I hope Apple can bring this functionality in-house sooner rather than later. I'd also like to see Apple refine the Type to Siri interface to handle longer-form interactions of multiple messages better. Right now, the interface isn't very conducive to those interactions.

More Apple Intelligence features are coming next year with iOS 18.3 and beyond, but as 2024 comes to an end, the Apple Intelligence suite is impressively strong. There are enough features throughout iOS 18.1 and iOS 18.2 that I think everyone will find a way Apple Intelligence benefits their life.

iOS 18.2 is a well-rounded update beyond Apple Intelligence. The upgrades to the Find My ecosystem should make it even easier to locate your lost items. The changes to the Photos app address user feedback while maintaining what I think is an overall excellent redesign. The new categorization features in the Mail app fall a bit short for how I use email, but Apple has made it easy to revert back to the single inbox view.

What is Apple Intelligence? (Image: Apple/Getty)

The tech buzzword for 2024 is most certainly AI. Most smartphone makers have opted to add artificial intelligence to their devices to try and give consumers new, exciting reasons to upgrade their phones. Apple has now joined the party with Apple Intelligence, its set of features available to select iPhone, iPad and Mac products via free software updates.

From rewriting texts to summarising emails or erasing people and objects from your photos, Apple Intelligence is now slowly rolling out to compatible Apple devices.

You might be unaware of what Apple Intelligence really is, what it can do, if it's all hype, and if your Apple gadgets will be getting in. In this article we will answer all of those questions to help you decide if the AI revolution is for you, or if you're perfectly happy to steer clear.

What is Apple Intelligence?

Apple Intelligence is Apple's set of software features that use artificial intelligence (AI) to perform various tasks and functions on some of the company's latest iPhone, iPad and Mac devices. These tools range from summarising notifications to helping you edit and rewrite messages, create a new kind of 3D emoji, and draw from data in all of your apps to improve the accuracy of answers digital voice assistant Siri can give you.

When is Apple Intelligence available?

Some features of Apple Intelligence were initially made available in iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1 and macOS Sequoia 15.1. The catch was that it was only technically out for users in the US, but you could get round that if you set your iPhone's language to US English.

As of 11 December 2024, Apple has released iOS 18.2, which switches on Apple Intelligence for compatible devices running UK English in the UK.

It's worth noting that not all the features and tools are currently available even if you have the latest software. Though Apple first announced the existence of Apple Intelligence at its WWDC event in June 2024, the firm is cautiously rolling out various features in stages.

Which iPhones are compatible with Apple Intelligence?

Here's the catch. Only the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, iPhone 16 Pro Max, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are compatible with Apple Intelligence. That's the latest generation of iPhone 16 and only the Pro models from the iPhone 15 range. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus don't support it, and nor do any iPhones older than them.

Which iPads are compatible with Apple Intelligence?

On the iPad front, if you have an iPad Pro with M1 chip or later, an iPad Air with M1 chip or later or the latest iPad mini with A17 Pro chip, you'll be getting Apple Intelligence.

Which Macs are compatible with Apple Intelligence?

The MacBook Air with M1 and later, MacBook Pro with M1 and later, iMac with M1 and later, Mac mini with M1 and later, Mac Studio with M1 Max and later and Mac Pro with M2 Ultra can all handle Apple Intelligence.

If you have a Mac with an Intel chip, you're out of luck.

How do I get Apple Intelligence?

If you live in the UK and own a compatible Apple device, you can access select Apple Intelligence features now. All you have to do is download the latest iOS or macOS version onto your device. These latest versions are iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2 and macOS Sequoia 15.2.

Do I need Apple Intelligence?

You don't necessarily need Apple Intelligence. It depends if you think the smarts it can deliver will be useful to you, and many are sceptical of its usefulness.

The best way to currently decide is by reading the rest of this article, and reading about all the features of Apple Intelligence in detail on Apple's website.

Though some tools may be useful, Apple is also playing catch up here with the rest of the smartphone industry, shown in its slow rollout of Apple Intelligence over several months. There is speculation that much of the trumpeting of the AI tools is to please shareholders, who were worried Apple was losing ground to its Android competitors and firms such as Google and OpenAI, the latter the maker of ChatGPT.

What can Apple Intelligence do?

While Apple Intelligence promises many fun and interesting features, it can only currently do a few of these things. Several features have not been released yet. Here's what Apple says you can currently do with Apple Intelligence.

Help with writing

If you find yourself struggling to write the perfect message, Apple Intelligence claims it can help you out. Supposedly a feature that will work in any app, you can ask the AI to rewrite, proofread or summarise any chunk of text. That means you could draft a message in Mail, Messages or WhatsApp, for instance, then ask Apple Intelligence to rewrite it for you in either a more friendly, professional, or concise way.

You can also summarise highlighted text, or condense it into key points, bullets, or a list.

Proofreading can check your grammar, word choice and sentence structure if you're nervous before sending that important work email, and you can reject suggestions for edits if you don't agree with them.

Improved Siri

Siri, Apple's voice assistant for iPhone, iPad and Mac is supposedly smarter with Apple Intelligence. It has been updated to be more conversational, so you should be able to have more of a natural natter to Siri rather than ask straightforward questions. It should also be able to remember the context of what you've already asked.

You'll notice if you have the new Siri because the edges of your iPhone's screen will light up now, rather than the amorphous Siri blob appearing at the bottom of your screen.

You can also now switch quickly between interacting with Siri via voice or by typing - you had to select one or the other before. Apple also says Siri has better knowledge of Apple settings so you can ask your devices how they work if you're not sure how to do something. At the moment, it looks as though this will only work best if you use Apple apps for most things: Mail, Messages, Notes and Calendar.

If you prefer Gmail, WhatsApp and Fantasical, Apple can't yet tap into those apps to cross-check your data, so Apple Intelligence won't be as, well, intelligent.

A smarter Photos app

You can now search your Photos app for specific images by typing in specific things, such as ""pictures of Henry on the beach"", and it should work if you've attached names to the important people in your life in the app, as you can do thanks to facial recognition. This also works for videos.

Just like Google's Magic Eraser tool, Photos now has a Clean Up tool that lets you erase unwanted objects in photos.

Add to that an improvement to the Memories feature that lets you create movies from your videos and photos by typing in a description, such as ""last winter in Berlin"", and Apple Intelligence should do the rest.

The Photos app has had a makeover (Image: Apple)

Tools for prioritising

Some of the features for priority messages only work if you use Apple apps, such as Mail and Messages. Gmail and WhatsApp stans could be out of luck, unless Apple lets third party developers in on the action.

Mail can now show you Priority Messages at the top of your inbox based on their context, such as emails that suggest you need to respond to them that day, or boarding passes, according to Apple. Emails are summarised so you don't; have to open them if not necessary, and this works for long email threads to summarise a long conversation.

Smart Reply claims to be able to suggest quick responses you can tap or click on that are generated by checking the contents of the message you're reading to identify appropriate quick responses.

You'll also get notification summaries, which are a new features that Apple says can condense information from a stack of notifications from apps (for example twenty new WhatsApp pings from a group chat) and give you a quick overview of the contents in natural language, saving you from having to read it all. Though, you'll probably have to go and read it all eventually.

A new Focus mode called Reduce Interruptions will also only ping you with the most important notifications if you're trying to get stuff done.

What Apple Intelligence features are coming soon?

Apple says more Apple Intelligence features will be available from December. This is also when we expect the tools to be available in UK English - remember, at present if you want to try any of the AI out you have to set your compatible devices to US English.

Apple is hyping up Genmoji, which presumably stands for 'generative emoji', where you can create unique emojis within messaging apps simply by typing any prompt: a pineapple with sunglasses, three cats singing the blues, a spanner with a face, you name it.

Image Playground will be a standalone app that offers you the chance to ""turn descriptions, concepts or people from your photo library into original, fun images in three unique styles"", according to Apple. A tool called Image Wand will also be able to turn your sketches into more realistic images, similar to Samsung's Sketch to Image function on its latest phones.

Apple says its writing tools will also expand with the ability to turn text into something specific such as a dinner invitation or poster for a party. As demonstrated in various product presentations, Apple will also add the option for Apple Intelligence devices to access ChatGPT within writing tools and Siri, but this appears to be something that you'll have to tap to acknowledge and accept, as ChatGPT is a third-party service not controlled by Apple. Apple has been careful to make its users aware when you could be giving your data to other companies.

Finally, another one to look out for that's due in December is built around the Camera Control button on the iPhone 16 series. Apple says tapping the button will get your iPhone's camera to scan what it sees and give you information about it, for example a restaurant, tourist attraction or object.

We'll be updating this article as Apple releases new Apple Intelligence features.

It looks like 2025 will be a big year for Apple's iPhone. Not only are we expecting an iPhone SE 4, but the iPhone 17 lineup will have some big changes, too. Coming off a particularly hot year with the iPhone 16 family, what changes and upgrades can we look forward to with the iPhone 17?

Here's everything we know about the iPhone 17 series so far.

iPhone 17: possible release date

Apple has a fairly regular release schedule for the flagship iPhone line, though there have been some deviations in the past. However, it's safe to say that the iPhone 17 will be announced and launched sometime in the fall, specifically in September.

Please enable Javascript to view this content

Let's look at Apple's historical track record when it comes to some of the recent iPhone releases.

iPhone 16: Announced September 9, released September 20, 2024 iPhone 15: Announced September 12, released September 22, 2023 iPhone 14: Announced September 7, released September 16, 2022

Unless there's another anomaly like the iPhone 12's October 2020 release, we can expect to see the iPhone 17 lineup revealed sometime in September 2025.

iPhone 17: possible price

We've only seen one report so far about the pricing for the iPhone 17 series, and it mostly aligns with what we've seen in the past. The base iPhone 17 should start at $799, the iPhone 17 Pro at $1,099, and the iPhone 17 Pro Max at $1,299.

However, there may be a change in this year's lineup, as Apple plans to eliminate the Plus variant and replace it with an iPhone 17 ""Slim"" model. There have been conflicting reports about this device's possible price.

Initially, when the iPhone 17 Slim rumors started, it seemed to be the next ""high-end"" device that would be as or more expensive than the Pro Max model and start at $1,299.

However, more recent rumors have indicated that the Slim may replace the Plus size, so it might end up with a price tag similar to the Plus, sitting between the base iPhone 17 and the iPhone 17 Pro.

iPhone 17: design

From the rumors we've seen so far, it looks like the iPhone 17 lineup could see some design changes from the current iPhone 16 family.

iPhone 17 'Slim' or 'Air'

Again, from the rumors, it seems Apple is eliminating the Plus size from the lineup. Instead, it will be replaced with a ""slim"" model, which could be called the iPhone 17 Slim or iPhone 17 ""Air.""

The reports about this device suggest that it will be 25% thinner than the iPhone 16 Pro. The thinness would be achieved by Apple using its in-house modem to replace the Qualcomm ones it previously used. However, a much thinner chassis may not leave much room for battery, which is something to consider.

The iPhone 17 Slim is likely to only feature a single-lens rear camera, similar to the iPhone SE series. Regarding placement of the rear camera, there are reports that it may be a vertical layout in the top-left corner like on the iPhone 16, or it could switch to a large, centered camera bump on the back.

There would not be enough room on the bottom edge for a speaker, so the iPhone 17 Slim may just have one speaker at the top. The frame will be titanium/aluminum, but with more aluminum in the mix than titanium compared to the current Pro models.

iPhone 17

Considering that Apple just tweaked the design of the iPhone 16, it's unlikely that we will see any major revamp for the base model iPhone 17.

Rumors have suggested that Apple may actually slightly increase the size of the base model iPhone 17 to 6.3 inches (up from 6.1 inches), which would be the same size as the iPhone 16 Pro. Aside from that, though, there hasn't been much information about the base model's design changes. Some mock-ups (like the one above), suggest we'll see a new camera design, but it's too early to tell at this point.

iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max

On the other hand, while the iPhone 16 Pro models looked the same as the past few years, it appears that we're in for big changes with the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max.

Initially, it was suggested that Apple would no longer use titanium for the iPhone 17 Pro models, but instead go back to an aluminum frame. However, a recent December report indicates that Apple will actually be sticking with titanium. All this is speculation, though, and we expect more contradictory reports from now until next September. But until then, either is a possibility, though we'd probably lean more heavily with the titanium.

The back glass could also change, going from an all-glass back to half aluminum and half glass. Rumors have indicated the top half of the back panel could be aluminum, while the bottom half is still glass, which would support wireless charging. Another benefit of having aluminum on the back would be more durability against drops, at least for the aluminum portion.

While the iPhone 16 Pro models were disappointing due to a lack of change with the camera design, it looks like the iPhone 17 Pro will have some significant changes in store. Apple could be removing the square camera module and replacing it with a rectangular camera bar made of aluminum. It's reminiscent of what Google has done on the Pixel 9 Pro.

The iPhone 17 Pro Max might have a smaller Dynamic Island. The reason behind that possibility is a new ""meta-lens"" that will be used for Face ID, which means less space is needed.

There is also a rumor about brighter, more saturated colors for the iPhone 17 Pro models, including dark green, teal, and green. This claim comes from leaker Majin Bu, though I would be skeptical of this one as the leaker has a mixed record with rumors in the past.

iPhone 17: display

One of the biggest complaints about the base model iPhone, even with the iPhone 16, is that it still uses a display with only a 60Hz refresh rate. That may be changing with the iPhone 17 series.

According to industry sources, Apple may use LTPO (low-temperature polycrystalline oxide) displays across the iPhone 17 lineup. Yes, that includes the base model and the Slim variant. LTPO technology allows an OLED screen to have a dynamic refresh rate while using less power. With this in mind, all iPhone 17 models should have the 120Hz ProMotion always-on display.

Another big change we may see is an anti-reflective layer on the glass, which would help reduce glare and make it easier to see outdoors. This coating could also make the screen more resistant to scratches than the current Ceramic Shield.

Now, let's talk about the sizes of the displays on each model. As we mentioned previously, the base model iPhone 17 could get a bump in size to a 6.3-inch LTPO OLED display. The iPhone 17 Slim/Air may be 6.6 inches, while the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max should remain 6.3 inches and 6.9 inches, respectively.

iPhone 17: specs

Apple always upgrades the new iPhones with faster and more efficient processors every year, and the iPhone 17 lineup will be no exception.

Unfortunately, it doesn't look like Apple will be getting TSMC's next-generation 2nm chip, but the A19 chips that we expect in the iPhone 17 should be manufactured with an upgraded 3nm process. This means a slight bump in performance and power efficiency.

For the base iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Slim, we will have the standard A19. The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max will be equipped with the A19 Pro.

In terms of RAM, the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Slim could have 8GB RAM. There are some conflicting reports regarding the Pro models, though. One rumor suggests that both Pro models will have 12GB RAM, while another says that only the Pro Max version will have 12GB RAM, while the regular Pro will have 8GB.

Apple has also been rumored to transition to its own in-house modems beginning in 2025, with the iPhone SE 4 being the first iPhone to switch from Qualcomm. The transition will take place over the next three years, so at least one of the iPhone 17 models will also have Apple's own 5G modem, while the rest could stick with Qualcomm.

iPhone 17: cameras

The cameras on the iPhone 17 lineup will also see some significant upgrades, which should be welcome news for iPhone photographers.

Across the board, the iPhone 17 lineup should have an improved front-facing selfie camera with 24MP resolution instead of 12MP. The higher megapixels should equate to higher detail and more clear selfies.

Apple may, unfortunately, bring back some feature disparity between the Pro models. Reports have suggested that only the iPhone 17 Pro Max would get a 48MP primary camera, 48MP ultrawide camera, and a 48MP telephoto camera -- the smaller iPhone 17 Pro would still have a 12MP telephoto lens if that's true. However, both Pro models should still have the 5x optical zoom capability.

For the slim variant, it will reportedly have a single-lens 48MP camera.

There have also been whispers that at least one iPhone 17 model will have a mechanical aperture, but it's unclear which one. Such a feature would allow users to adjust the size of the aperture to change the amount of light that comes in through the lens. Currently, iPhones have a fixed aperture, but with a variable aperture, images can be captured with a more shallow depth of field.

iPhone 17: battery life

The upgraded manufacturing process for the A19 chip should mean we have better performance and power efficiency. Typically, Apple doesn't significantly increase battery capacity, but we should see potential increases in battery life due to the processor's power efficiency, even if the capacity is similar to the current generation.

But there may be welcome news for those who want to replace their iPhone 17 batteries in the future. Apple began using a new type of adhesive that can be loosened with a low-voltage electrical current, which has been used in the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, but not the Pro models. This adhesive makes removing the battery easier if one needs to replace it. If Apple uses this new adhesive across the entire iPhone 17 lineup, battery replacements will be easier.",Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/apple-iphone-17-everything-we-know-so-far/,2024-12-11,

"Apple Intelligence in iOS 18.2: A Deep Dive into Working with Siri and ChatGPT, Together","Apple is releasing iOS and iPadOS 18.2 today, and with those software updates, the company is rolling out the second wave of Apple Intelligence features as part of their previously announced roadmap that will culminate with the arrival of deeper integration between Siri and third-party apps next year.

In today's release, users will find native integration between Siri and ChatGPT, more options in Writing Tools, a smarter Mail app with automatic message categorization, generative image creation in Image Playground, Genmoji, Visual Intelligence, and more. It's certainly a more ambitious rollout than the somewhat disjointed debut of Apple Intelligence with iOS 18.1, and one that will garner more attention if only by virtue of Siri's native access to OpenAI's ChatGPT.

And yet, despite the long list of AI features in these software updates, I find myself mostly underwhelmed - if not downright annoyed - by the majority of the Apple Intelligence changes, but not for the reasons you may expect coming from me.

Some context is necessary here. As I explained in a recent episode of AppStories, I've embarked on a bit of a journey lately in terms of understanding the role of AI products and features in modern software. I've been doing a lot of research, testing, and reading about the different flavors of AI tools that we see pop up on almost a daily basis now in a rapidly changing landscape. As I discussed on the show, I've landed on two takeaways, at least for now:

I see these tools as a natural evolution of automation and, as you can guess, that has inevitably caught my interest. The implications for the Accessibility community in this field are also something we should keep in mind.

To put it more simply, I think empowering LLMs to be ""creative"" with the goal of displacing artists is a mistake, and also a distraction - a glossy facade largely amounting to a party trick that gets boring fast and misses the bigger picture of how these AI tools may practically help us in the workplace, healthcare, biology, and other industries.

This is how I approached my tests with Apple Intelligence in iOS and iPadOS 18.2. For the past month, I've extensively used Claude to assist me with the making of advanced shortcuts, used ChatGPT's search feature as a Google replacement, indexed the archive of my iOS reviews with NotebookLM, relied on Zapier's Copilot to more quickly spin up web automations, and used both Sonnet 3.5 and GPT-4o to rethink my Obsidian templating system and note-taking workflow. I've used AI tools for real, meaningful work that revolved around me - the creative person - doing the actual work and letting software assist me. And at the same time, I tried to add Apple's new AI features to the mix.

Perhaps it's not ""fair"" to compare Apple's newfangled efforts to products by companies that have been iterating on their LLMs and related services for the past five years, but when the biggest tech company in the world makes bold claims about their entrance into the AI space, we have to take them at face value.

It's been an interesting exercise to see how far behind Apple is compared to OpenAI and Anthropic in terms of the sheer capabilities of their respective assistants; at the same time, I believe Apple has some serious advantages in the long term as the platform owner, with untapped potential for integrating AI more deeply within the OS and apps in a way that other AI companies won't be able to. There are parts of Apple Intelligence in 18.2 that hint at much bigger things to come in the future that I find exciting, as well as features available today that I've found useful and, occasionally, even surprising.

With this context in mind, in this story you won't see any coverage of Image Playground and Image Wand, which I believe are ridiculously primitive and perfect examples of why Apple may think they're two years behind their competitors. Image Playground in particular produces ""illustrations"" that you'd be kind to call abominations; they remind me of the worst Midjourney creations from 2022. Instead, I will focus on the more assistive aspects of AI and share my experience with trying to get work done using Apple Intelligence on my iPhone and iPad alongside its integration with ChatGPT, which is the marquee addition of this release.

Apple Intelligence in iOS and iPadOS 18.2 offers direct integration with OpenAI's ChatGPT using the GPT-4o model. This is based on a ChatGPT extension that can be enabled in Settings ⇾ Apple Intelligence & Siri ⇾ Extensions.

The mere existence of an 'Extensions' section seems to confirm that Apple may consider offering other LLMs in the future in addition to ChatGPT, but that's a story for another time. For now, you can only choose to activate the ChatGPT extension (it's turned off by default), and in doing so, you have two options. You can choose to use ChatGPT as an anonymous, signed-out user. In this case, your IP address will be obscured on OpenAI's servers, and only the contents of your request will be sent to ChatGPT. According to Apple, while in this mode, OpenAI must process your request and discard it afterwards; furthermore, the request won't be used to improve or train OpenAI's models.

You can also choose to log in with an existing ChatGPT account directly from the Settings app. When logged in, OpenAI's data retention policies will apply, and your requests may be used for training of the company's models. Furthermore, your conversations with Siri that involve ChatGPT processing will be saved in your OpenAI account, and you'll be able to see your previous Siri requests in ChatGPT's conversation sidebar in the ChatGPT app and website.

You have the option to use ChatGPT for free or with your paid ChatGPT Plus account. In the ChatGPT section of the Settings app, Apple shows the limits that are in place for free users and offers an option to upgrade to a Plus account directly from Settings. According to Apple, only a small number of requests that use the latest GPT-4o and DALL-E 3 models can be processed for free before having to upgrade. For this article, I used my existing ChatGPT Plus account, so I didn't run into any limits.

But how does Siri actually determine if ChatGPT should swoop in and answer a question on its behalf? There are more interesting caveats and implementation details worth covering here.

By default, Siri tries to determine if any regular request may be best answered by ChatGPT rather than Siri itself. In my experience, this usually means that more complicated questions or those that pertain to ""world knowledge"" outside of Siri's domain get handed off to ChatGPT and are subsequently displayed by Siri with its new ""snippet"" response style in iOS 18 that looks like a taller notification banner.

For instance, if I ask ""What's the capital of Italy?"", Siri can respond with a rich snippet that includes its own answer accompanied by a picture. However, if I ask ""What's the capital of Italy, and has it always been the capital of Italy?"", the additional information required causes Siri to automatically fall back to ChatGPT, which provides a textual response.

Siri knows its limits; effectively, ChatGPT has replaced the ""I found this on the web"" results that Siri used to bring up before it had access to OpenAI's knowledge. In the absence of a proper Siri LLM (more on this later), I believe this is a better compromise than the older method that involved Google search results. At the very least, now you're getting an answer instead of a bunch of links.

You can also format your request to explicitly ask Siri to query ChatGPT. Starting your request with ""Ask ChatGPT..."" is a foolproof technique to go directly to ChatGPT, and you should use it any time you're sure Siri won't be able to answer immediately.

I should also note that, by default, Siri in iOS 18.2 will always confirm with you whether you want to send a request to ChatGPT. There is, however, a way to turn off these confirmation prompts: on the ChatGPT Extension screen in Settings, turn off the 'Confirm ChatGPT Requests' option, and you'll no longer be asked if you want to pass a request to ChatGPT every time. Keep in mind, though, that this preference is ignored when you're sending files to ChatGPT for analysis, in which case you'll always be asked to confirm your request since those files may contain sensitive information.

The other area of iOS and iPadOS that is receiving ChatGPT integration today is Writing Tools, which debuted in iOS 18.1 as an Apple Intelligence-only feature. As we know, Writing Tools are now prominently featured system-wide in any text field thanks to their placement in the edit menu, and they're also available directly in the top toolbar of the Notes app.

In iOS 18.2, Writing Tools gain the ability to refine text by letting you describe changes you want made, and they also come with a new 'Compose' submenu powered by ChatGPT, which lets you ask OpenAI's assistant to write something for you based on the content of the document you're working on.

If the difference between the two sounds confusing, you're not alone. Here's how you can think about it, though: the 'Describe your change' text field at the top of Writing Tools defaults to asking Apple Intelligence, but may fall back to ChatGPT if Apple Intelligence doesn't know what you mean; the Compose menu always uses ChatGPT. It's essentially just like Siri, which tries to answer on its own, but may rely on ChatGPT and also includes a manual override to skip Apple Intelligence altogether.

In testing the updated Writing Tools with ChatGPT integration, I've run into some limitations that I will cover below, but I also had two very positive experiences with the Notes app that I want to mention here since they should give you an idea of what's possible.

In my first test, I was working with a note that contained a list of payments for my work at MacStories and Relay FM, plus the amount of taxes I was setting aside each month. The note originated in Obsidian, and after I pasted it into Apple Notes, it lost all its formatting.

There were no proper section headings, the formatting was inconsistent between paragraphs, and the monetary amounts had been entered with different currency symbols for EUR. I wanted to make the note look prettier with consistent formatting, so I opened the 'Compose' field of Writing Tools and sent ChatGPT the following request:

This is a document that describes payments I sent to myself each month from two sources: Relay FM and MacStories. The currency is always EUR. When I mention ""set aside"", it means I set aside a percentage of those combined payments for tax purposes. Can you reformat this note in a way that makes more sense?

I hit Return, and after a few seconds, ChatGPT reworked my text with a consistent structure organized into sections with bullet points and proper currency formatting. I was immediately impressed, so I accepted the suggested result, and I ended up with the same note, elegantly formatted just like I asked.

This shouldn't come as a surprise: ChatGPT - especially the GPT-4o model - is pretty good at working with numbers. Still, this is the sort of use case that makes me optimistic about this flavor of AI integration; I could have done this manually by carefully selecting text and manually making each line consistent, but it was going to be boring busywork that would have wasted a bunch of my time. And that's time that is, frankly, best spent doing research, writing, or promoting my work on social media. Instead, Writing Tools and ChatGPT worked with my data, following a natural language query, and modified the contents of my note in seconds. Even better, after the note had been successfully updated, I was able to ask for more additional information including averages, totals for each revenue source, and more. I could have done this in a spreadsheet, but I didn't want to (and I also never understood formulas), and it was easier to do so with natural language in a popup menu of the Notes app.

The second example of ChatGPT and Writing Tools applied to regular MacStories work involves our annual MacStories Selects awards. Before getting together with the MacStories team on a Zoom call to discuss our nominees and pick winners, we created a shared note in Apple Notes where different writers entered their picks. When I opened the note, I realized that I was behind others and forgot to enter the different categories of awards in my section of the document. So I invoked ChatGPT's Compose menu under a section heading with my name and asked:

Can you add a section with the names of the same categories that John used? Just the names of those categories.

A few seconds later, Writing Tools pasted this section below my name:

This may seem like a trivial task, but I don't think it is. ChatGPT had to evaluate a long list of sections (all formatted differently from one another), understand where the sections entered by John started and ended, and extract the names of categories, separating them from the actual picks under each category. Years ago, I would have had to do a lot of copying and pasting, type it all out manually, or write a shortcut with regular expressions to automate this process. Now, the ""automation"" takes place as a natural language command that has access to the contents of a note and can reformat it accordingly.

As we'll see below, there are plenty of scenarios in which Writing Tools, despite the assistance from ChatGPT, fails at properly integrating with the Notes app and understanding some of the finer details behind my requests. But given that this is the beginning of a new way to think about working with text in any text field (third-party developers can integrate with Writing Tools), I'm excited about the prospect of abstracting app functionalities and formatting my documents in a faster, more natural way.

Having used ChatGPT extensively via its official app on my iPhone and iPad for the past month, one thing is clear to me: Apple has a long way to go if they want to match what's possible with the standalone ChatGPT experience in their own Siri integration - not to mention with Siri itself without the help from ChatGPT.

The elephant in the room here is the lack of a single, self-contained Siri LLM experience in the form of an app that can remember all of your conversations and keep the context of an ongoing conversation across multiple sessions. Today, Apple's efforts to infuse Siri with more ""Apple Intelligence"" result in a scattershot implementation comprised of disposable interactions that forego the true benefits of LLMs, lacking a cohesive vision. It's quite telling that the best part of the ""new"" Siri experience is the ChatGPT integration in 18.2, and even then, it's no replacement for the full-featured ChatGPT app.

With ChatGPT on my iPhone and iPad, all my conversations and their full transcripts are saved and made accessible for later. I can revisit a conversation about any topic I'm researching with ChatGPT days after I started it and pick up exactly where I left off. Even while I'm having a conversation with ChatGPT, I can look further up in the transcript and see what was said before I continue asking anything else. The whole point of modern LLMs is to facilitate this new kind of computer-human conversation where the entire context can be referenced, expanded upon, and queried.

Siri still doesn't have any of this - and that's because it really isn't based on an LLM yet. While Siri can hold some context of a conversation while traversing from question to question, it can't understand longer requests written in natural language that reference a particular point of an earlier request. It doesn't show you the earlier transcript, whether you're talking or typing to it. By and large, conversations in Siri are still ephemeral. You ask a question, get a response, and can ask a follow-up question (but not always); as soon as Siri is dismissed, though, the entire conversation is gone.

As a result, the ChatGPT integration in iOS 18.2 doesn't mean that Siri can now be used for production workflows where you want to hold an ongoing conversation about a topic or task and reference it later. ChatGPT is the shoulder for Siri to temporarily cry on; it's the guardian parent that can answer basic questions in a better way than before while ultimately still exposing the disposable, inconsistent, impermanent Siri that is far removed from the modern experience of real LLMs.

But let's disregard for a second the fact that Apple doesn't have a Siri LLM experience comparable to ChatGPT or Claude yet, assume that's going to happen at some point in 2026, and remain optimistic about Siri's future. I still believe that Apple isn't taking advantage of ChatGPT enough and could do so much more to make iOS 18 seem ""smarter"" than it actually is while relying on someone else's intelligence.

Unlike other AI companies, Apple has a moat: they make the physical devices we use, create the operating systems, and control the app ecosystem. Thus, Apple has an opportunity to leverage deep, system-level integrations between AI and the apps billions of people use every day. This is the most exciting aspect of Apple Intelligence; it's a bummer that, despite the help from ChatGPT, I've only seen a handful of instances in which AI results can be used in conjunction with apps. Let me give you some examples and comparisons between ChatGPT and Siri to show you what I mean.

In addition to text requests, ChatGPT has been integrated with image and file uploads across iOS and iPadOS. For example, if you have a long PDF document you want to summarize, you can ask Siri to give you a summary of it, and the assistant will display a file upload popup that says the item will be sent to ChatGPT for analysis.

In this popup, you can choose the type of file representation you want to send: you can upload a screenshot of a document to ChatGPT directly from Siri, or you can give it the contents of the entire document. This technique isn't limited to documents, nor is it exclusive to the style of request I mentioned above. Any time you invoke Siri while looking at a photo, webpage, email message, or screenshot, you can invoke requests like...

...and ChatGPT will be summoned - even without explicitly saying, ""Ask ChatGPT..."" - with the file upload permission prompt. As of iOS and iPadOS 18.2, you can always choose between sending a copy of the full content of an item (usually as a PDF) or a screenshot of just what's shown on-screen.

In any case, after a few seconds, ChatGPT will provide a response based on the file you gave it, and this is where things get interesting - in both surprising and disappointing ways.

By default, you'll find a copy button in the notification with the ChatGPT response, so that's nice. Between the Side button, Type to Siri (which also got a Control Center control in 18.2), and the copy button next to responses, the iPhone now has the fastest way to go from a spoken/typed request to a ChatGPT response copied to the clipboard.

But what if you want to do more with a response? In iOS and iPadOS 18.2, you can follow up to a ChatGPT response with, ""Make a note out of this"", and the response will be saved as a new note in the Notes app with a nice UI shown in the Siri notification.

This surprised me, and it's the sort of integration that makes me hopeful about the future role of an LLM on Apple platforms - a system that can support complex conversations while also sending off responses into native apps.

Sadly, this is about as far as Apple's integration between ChatGPT and apps went for this release. Everything else that I tried did not work, in the sense that Siri either didn't understand what I was asking for or ChatGPT replied that it didn't have enough access to my device to perform that action.

Specifically:

Why is it that Apple is making a special exception for creating notes out of responses, but nothing else works? Is this the sort of thing that will magically get better once Apple Intelligence gets connected to App Intents? It's hard to tell right now.

The lackluster integration between ChatGPT and native system functions goes beyond Siri responses and extends to Writing Tools. When I attempted to go even slightly beyond the guardrails of the Compose feature, things got weird:

Clearly, Apple has some work to do if they want to match user requests with the native styling and objects supported by the Notes app. But that's not the only area where I've noticed a disparity between Siri and ChatGPT's capabilities, resulting in a strange mix of interactions when the two are combined.

One of my favorite features of ChatGPT's website and app is the ability to store bits of data in a personal memory that can be recalled at any time. Memories can be used to provide further context to the LLM in future requests as well as to jot down something that you want to remember later. Alas, ChatGPT accessed via Siri can't retrieve the user's personal memories, despite the ability to log into your ChatGPT account and save conversations you have with Siri. When asked to access my memory, ChatGPT via Siri responds as such:

I'm here to assist you by responding to your questions and requests, but I don't have the ability to access any memory or personal data. I operate only within the context of our current conversation.

That's too bad, and it only exacerbates the fact that Apple is limited to an à la carte assistant that doesn't really behave like an LLM (because it can't).

The most ironic part of the Siri-ChatGPT relationship, however, is that Siri is not multilingual, but ChatGPT is, so you can use OpenAI's assistant to fill a massive hole in Siri's functionality via some clever prompting.

My Siri is set to English, but if I ask it in Italian, ""Chiedi a ChatGPT"" (""Ask ChatGPT""), followed by an Italian request, ""Siri"" will respond in Italian since ChatGPT - in addition to different modalities - also supports hopping between languages in the same conversation. Even if I take an Italian PDF document and tell Siri in English to, ""Ask ChatGPT to summarize this in its original language"", that's going to work.

Speaking as a bilingual person, this is terrific - but at the same time, it underlines how deeply ChatGPT puts Siri to shame when it comes to being more accessible for international users. What's even funnier is that Siri tries to tell me I'm wrong when I'm typing in Italian in its English text field (and that's in spite of the new bilingual keyboard in iOS 18), but when the request is sent off to ChatGPT, it doesn't care.

I want to wrap up this section with an example of what I mean by assistive AI in regards to productivity and why I now believe so strongly in the potential to connect LLMs with apps.

I've been trying Todoist again lately, and I discovered the existence of a TodoistGPT extension for ChatGPT that lets you interact with the task manager using ChatGPT's natural language processing. So I had an idea: what if I took a screenshot of a list in the Reminders app and asked ChatGPT to identify the tasks in it and recreate them with the same properties in Todoist?

I asked:

This is a screenshot of a work project in the Reminders app. Can you identify the two remaining tasks in it, along with their due dates and, if applicable, repeat patterns?

ChatGPT identified them correctly, parsing the necessary fields for title, due date, and repeat pattern. I then followed up by asking:

Can you add these to my Work Review project?

And, surely enough, the tasks found in the image were recreated as new tasks in my Todoist account.

Right now, Siri can't do this. Even though the ChatGPT integration can recognize the same tasks, asking Siri a follow-up question to add those tasks to Reminders in a different list will fail.

Think about this idea for a second: in theory, the web-based integration I just described is similar to the scenario Apple is proposing with App Intents and third-party apps in Apple Intelligence. Apple has the unique opportunity to leverage the millions of apps on the App Store - and the multiple thousands that will roll out App Intents in the short term - to quickly spin up an ecosystem of third-party integrations for Apple Intelligence via the apps people already use on their phones.

How will that work without a proper Siri LLM? How flexible will the app domains supported at launch be in practice? It's hard to tell now, but it's also the field of Apple Intelligence that - unlike gross and grotesque image generation features - has my attention.

The other area of iOS that now features ChatGPT integration is Visual Intelligence. Originally announced in September, Visual Intelligence is a new Camera Control mode and, as such, exclusive to the new iPhone 16 family of devices.

With Visual Intelligence, you can point your iPhone's camera at something and get information about what's in frame from either ChatGPT or Google search - the first case of two search providers embedded within the same Apple Intelligence functionality of iOS. Visual Intelligence is not a real-time camera view that can overlay information on top of a live camera feed; instead, it freezes the frame and sends a picture to ChatGPT or Google, without saving that image to your photo library.

The interactions of Visual Intelligence are fascinating, and an area where I think Apple did a good job picking a series of reasonable defaults. You activate Visual Intelligence by long-pressing on Camera Control, which reveals a new animation that combines the glow effect of the new Siri with the faux depressed button state first seen with the Action and volume buttons in iOS 18. It looks really nice. After you hold down for a second, you'll feel some haptic feedback, and the camera view of Visual Intelligence will open in the foreground.

Once you're in camera mode, you have two options: you either manually press the shutter button to freeze the frame then choose between ChatGPT and Google, or you press one of those search providers first, and the frame will be frozen automatically.

Google is the easier integration to explain here. It's basically reverse image search built into the iPhone's camera and globally available via Camera Control. I can't tell you how many times my girlfriend and I rely on Google Lens to look up outfits we see on TV, furniture we see in magazines, or bottles of wine, so having this built into iOS without having to use Google's iPhone app is extra nice. Results appear in a popup inside Visual Intelligence, and you can pick one to open it in Safari. As far as integrating Google's reverse image search with the operating system goes, Apple has pretty much nailed the interaction here.

ChatGPT has been equally well integrated with the Visual Intelligence experience. By default, when you press the 'Ask' button, ChatGPT will instantly analyze the picture and describe what you're looking at, so you have a starting point for the conversation. The whole point of this feature, in fact, is to be able to inquire about additional details or use the picture as visual context for a request you have.

I'll give you an example. A few days ago, Silvia and I noticed that the heated tower rail in our bathroom was making a low hissing noise. There were clearly valves we were supposed to operate to let air out of the system, but I wanted to be sure because I'm not a plumber. So I invoked Visual Intelligence, took a picture, and asked ChatGPT - in Italian - how I was supposed to let the air out. Within seconds, I got the confirmation I was looking for: I needed to turn the valve in the upper left corner.

I can think of plenty of other scenarios in everyday life where the ability to ask questions about what I'm looking at may be useful. Whether you're looking up instructions to operate different types of equipment, dealing with recipes, learning more about landmarks, or translating signs and menus in a different country, there are clear, tangible benefits when it comes to augmenting vision with the conversational knowledge of an LLM.

Right now, all Apple Intelligence queries to ChatGPT are routed to the GPT-4o model; I can imagine that, with the o1 model now supporting image uploads, Apple may soon offer the option to enable slower but more accurate visual responses powered by advanced reasoning. In my tests, GPT-4o has been good enough to address the things I was showing it via Visual Intelligence. It's a feature I plan to use often - certainly more than the other (confusing) options of Camera Control.

Looking ahead at the next year, it seems clear that Apple will continue taking a staged approach to evolving Apple Intelligence in their bid to catch up with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Meta.

Within the iOS 18 cycle, we'll see Siri expand its on-screen vision capabilities and gain the ability to draw on users' personal context; then, Apple Intelligence will be integrated with commands from third-party apps based on schemas and App Intents; according to rumors, this will culminate with the announcement of a second-generation Siri LLM at WWDC 2025 that will feature a more ChatGPT-like assistant capable of holding longer conversations and perhaps storing them for future access in a standalone app. We can speculatively assume that Siri LLM will be showcased at WWDC 2025 and released in the spring of 2026.

Taking all this into account, it's evident that, as things stand today, Apple is two years behind their competitors in the AI chatbot space. Training large language models is a time-consuming, expensive task that is ballooning in cost and, according to some, leading to diminishing returns as a byproduct of scaling laws.

Today, Apple is stuck between the proverbial rock and hard place. ChatGPT is the fastest-growing software product in modern history, Meta's bet on open-source AI is resulting in an explosion of models that can be trained and integrated into hardware accessories, agents, and apps with a low barrier to entry, and Google - facing an existential threat to search at the hands of LLM-powered web search - is going all-in on AI features for Android and Pixel phones. Like it or not, the vast majority of consumers now expect AI features on their devices; whether Apple was caught flat-footed here or not, the company today simply doesn't have the technology to offer an experience comparable to ChatGPT, Llama-based models, Claude, or Gemini, that's entirely powered by Siri.

So, for now, Apple is following the classic ""if you can't beat them, join them"" playbook. ChatGPT and other chatbots will supplement Siri with additional knowledge; meanwhile, Apple will continue to release specialized models optimized for specific iOS features, such as Image Wand in Notes, Clean Up in Photos, summarization in Writing Tools, inbox categorization in Mail, and so forth.

All this begs a couple of questions. Will Apple's piecemeal AI strategy be effective in slowing down the narrative that they are behind other companies, showing their customers that iPhones are, in fact, powered by AI? And if Apple will only have a Siri LLM by 2026, where will ChatGPT and the rest of the industry be by then?

Given the pace of AI tools' evolution in 2024 alone, it's easy to look at Apple's position and think that, no matter their efforts and the amount of capital thrown at the problem, they're doomed. And this is where - despite my belief that Apple is indeed at least two years behind - I disagree with this notion.

You see, there's another question that begs to be asked: will OpenAI, Anthropic, or Meta have a mobile operating system or lineup of computers with different form factors in two years? I don't think they will, and that buys Apple some time to catch up.

In the business and enterprise space, it's likely that OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google will become more and more entrenched between now and 2026 as corporations begin gravitating toward agentic AI and rethink their software tooling around AI. But modern Apple has never been an enterprise-focused company. Apple is focused on personal technology and selling computers of different sizes and forms to, well, people. And I'm willing to bet that, two years from now, people will still want to go to a store and buy themselves a nice laptop or phone.

Despite their slow progress, this is Apple's moat. The company's real opportunity in the AI space shouldn't be to merely match the features and performance of chatbots; their unique advantage is the ability to rethink the operating systems of the computers we use around AI.

Don't be fooled by the gaudy, archaic, and tone-deaf distractions of Image Playground and Image Wand. Apple's true opening is in the potential of breaking free from the chatbot UI, building an assistive AI that works alongside us and the apps we use every day to make us more productive, more connected, and, as always, more creative.

That's the artificial intelligence I hope Apple is building. And that's the future I'd like to cover on MacStories.",MacStories,https://www.macstories.net/stories/apple-intelligence-and-chatgpt-in-18-2/,2024-12-11,

I Have Been an Apple User for 10 Years and Here's How I Make Most out of Apple Ecosystem,"I'm an Apple superfan and have invested heavily in the Apple ecosystem. I started with an iPhone, then bought a Mac and iPad, and now I've got a device from almost every lineup. Ten years down, I'm happily tied to the Apple ecosystem, and it has made my everyday life a lot easier. The Apple Ecosystem offers seamless connectivity between devices that can make incredible things happen. There are many reasons to love the Apple ecosystem. Right from the ability to switch your AirPods depending on the device you're using to access all your photos and files across your gear, Apple offers an array of convenient features.

After using Apple devices for more than a decade now, I've curated a list of the 13 best features that can help you unleash the true power of the Apple ecosystem. If you've invested in multiple Apple devices or are planning to do so, this guide will help you make enjoy a connected experience.

Note:

One of the strongest suites of the Apple Ecosystem is how connected everything is. When you've signed in with the same Apple ID on your Apple devices, you can sync your files, contacts, photos, and everything else across your devices, including iPhone, iPad, and Mac. There are several cloud-based services like Google Drive and Microsoft One that give you the liberty to back up your iPhone and access all your documents on the go. Apple's iCloud gives a solid advantage if you've invested in the Apple ecosystem. It lets you sync your files across all your devices, including your desktop.

With iCloud Drive, all your documents, folders, and files are automatically synced across your devices where you've signed in with the same Apple ID. So, any time you add a new document to your Mac or a new file on your iPhone, it will be automatically uploaded to iCloud. You can anytime access your documents, folders, and projects via the Files app on your device. This helps you keep your files up to date across your Apple devices.

To sync your files with iCloud, you have to do the following:

Love your Mac, but don't like its old 720p camera? This feature can help you fix such problems. Introduced with macOS Ventura, Continuity Camera is a useful feature that allows you to use the powerful camera system of your iPhone as a webcam for your Mac. With Continuity Camera, your Mac can recognize a nearby iPhone (with the same Apple ID) without having to wake or select it, helping establish a wireless connection between an iPhone and a Mac. This can help video calls on a Mac with features like Center Stage, Portrait mode, Studio Light, and Desk View.

To use your iPhone as a webcam on a Mac, you have to mount your iPhone to your Mac using a compatible mount or stand. When mounted, your iPhone should be locked, in a stable landscape orientation, positioned with its rear cameras unobstructed facing you, and near your Mac.

Once your iPhone is properly mounted, its camera and microphone should be available to use within the compatible apps. To use your iPhone's camera on Mac, open FaceTime or any other supported app, and choose your iPhone camera from the app's video menu, camera menu, or another setting. Unless your Mac has a built-in or external mic, your app should choose your iPhone's mic automatically. If that doesn't happen, open System Settings -> Sound and select your iPhone in the Input tab.

If you own a pair of AirPods, you would know how seamlessly they pair and work with an iPhone. But, did you know that your AirPods can become your go-to audio accessory with all your Apple devices, including your Mac? Well, Apple offers a clever Handoff feature that lets you seamlessly switch between your iPhone, iPad, and Mac. This feature is enabled by default on your devices. So, if you've connected AirPods to your iPhone and you then switch to your Mac, a notification will pop up automatically asking if you wish to connect. Besides, you can also use Handoff to swap FaceTime calls between your iPhone and Mac.

With the Handoff feature, you don't have to go to settings and manually switch between the devices. Any pair of earbuds or headphones with Apple's H1 or W1 chip supports the HandOff feature. This includes all AirPods and most of the wireless headphones from Beats.

That's not all. Apple's Handoff feature also gives you the freedom to start something on one device and finish it on another. This is an absolute convenience. When you've signed in with the same iCloud account on your devices, any changes you make to Notes, Reminders, Messages, Contacts, Mail, etc will be synced across your devices. You can easily start a task on one device and continue it on your other device. For instance, you can prepare notes for your upcoming meeting/vacation on your iPhone, you can pick it up later on your MacBook. With Apple's Continuity features, you're always in sync, no matter which device you're using.

Gone are the days when you would have to pull out a cable to transfer some files or photos between your phone and computer. If you've invested in the Apple ecosystem, you can easily exchange files via Bluetooth. AirDrop is one of the most valuable features of the Apple ecosystem that simplifies file sharing across your Apple devices. This feature is available on all Apple devices by default and doesn't require any dedicated setup. It uses Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to transfer files, photos, videos, contacts, map locations, websites, and more between nearby Apple devices. It's a fast, secure, and reliable way to send and receive files between your iPhone and Mac, or other gear.

Thanks to AirDrop, these everyday transfers don't feel like a task. I can quickly transfer files between my Apple devices without any hassle. Unarguably, AirDrop is one of the best features that can help you make the most out of the Apple Ecosystem.

If you're a beginner, you can check out our guide on how to turn on AirDrop on iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

Here's another interesting Apple ecosystem that can boost your productivity. The latest iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia brings a super-useful iPhone Mirroring feature that lets you use your iPhone, check out iPhone notifications, use iPhone apps, and do a lot more, from your Mac's display. For many users, iPhone Mirroring is their favorite Apple feature that brings a ton of convenience.

With iPhone Mirroring, you can move your files, photos, videos, and files between your iPhone and Mac wirelessly. The drag-and-drop works even if your iPhone is locked and charging. To transfer photos from your Mac to your iPhone, drag a photo from the Finder window or Photos app and drop it to the Photos app on your iPhone. You can also do vice-versa. Similarly, to move a PDF or document, drag it from your Mac to the Files app on your iPhone.

To transfer files, your iPhone and Mac should be running the latest developer beta of iOS 18.1 and macOS Sequoia, respectively. The stable version of this feature will be available with iOS 18.1 and macOS Sequoia 15.1 arriving on October 28.

Besides drag & drop, iPhone Mirroring lets you access your iPhone's Home Screen, use Spotlight search on your iPhone, and use your Mac's keyboard to type messages, emails, and other documents on your iPhone. For more details, you can check out our detailed guide on how to set up and use iPhone Mirroring on Mac.

If you've got an iPad, you don't need to invest in another external display for your Mac. Thanks to the amazingly connected Apple ecosystem, you can use your iPad as a second display for your Mac wirelessly. Sidecar is an incredible feature for anyone who wishes to boost their workflow with a multi-monitor setup that can be moved anywhere. The best thing about the Sidecar feature is that you can use it wired or wirelessly. Therefore, it's super easy to set up and get going, no matter where you are.

The Sidebar also puts commonly used Mac controls on the side of your iPad screen. It includes Shift, Command, and other essential commands that you can choose with your finger or Apple Pencil instead of a keyboard. That means, you can see your main work window on your Mac and access tools from your iPad. Also, you can mirror your iPad screen on your Mac to see the same content. So whether you're a student, a creative on a work trip, or a full-time digital nomad, Sidecar can help you unleash the true capability of your Apple devices.

To know prerequisites, compatible devices, and set-up details, you can check out our guide on how to use an iPad as a second display for Mac.

There can be instances when you discover something interesting while browsing on your Mac and wish to share it on your social media using your iPhone or iPad. In such situations, the Universal Clipboard comes in really handy it lets you copy content like text, photos, and videos from one Apple device and paste it onto another device with the same Apple ID. This feature is available on all devices running macOS Sierra or later, iOS 10 or later, and visionOS.

To copy content between your Apple devices, you must enable Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and HandOff on both devices.

Once your prerequisites are sorted, copy the text or photo on one device as you would normally do. The content will be automatically added to the clipboard of your other nearby device and will remain there until you replace it by copying something else. Finally, paste the copied content on the intended device as normal.

Another useful feature of the Apple ecosystem is the ability to route your iPhone calls to your iPad or Mac. Also, you can make calls from your iPad or Mac if your iPhone is in another room. Besides phone calls, you can also route your text messages from iPhone to iPad or Mac so you can stay connected no matter which device you're using.

For this, you must enable Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and FaceTime on your devices. Of course, you must sign in with the same Apple ID on your devices.

Once you've done this, follow the below steps to set up iPhone calls on other devices:

Being a long-time Apple user, I absolutely love how easily I can access my photos and videos across my devices. Apple's iCloud is an incredibly powerful tool that automatically backs up important data on your device. When you've enabled iCloud Photos sync, any photo or video you capture on your iPhone will be automatically uploaded to iCloud. Therefore, it will be available on all your other Apple devices, including your iPad, Mac, or the iCloud website. In short, iCloud Photos helps you access your iPhone photo library on every device you own.

We all know there isn't a way to expand storage on our iPhones or other Apple devices. Thankfully, iCloud photo syncing also helps you manage storage on your Apple devices. You can free up precious storage space on your devices while keeping your entire photo library within your reach.

To enable iCloud Photos syncing on your iPhone or iPad, open Settings -> Apps -> Photos -> iCloud Photos and turn the toggle on.

On your Mac, open the Photos app, click on Photos from the top Menu bar, and choose Settings. From the iCloud tab, make sure there's a ""Checkmark"" against ""iCloud Photos"".

If you've subscribed to iCloud+ and have a lot of storage space, you can share it with up to 5 family members or friends using Apple Family Sharing. Depending on your subscription, you can share up to 12TB of iCloud storage space and other features like iCloud Private Relay, Hide My Email, and HomeKit Secure Video support.

Bear in mind that only the iCloud storage space and features are shared. You can share family photo albums, but each member's photos and other information will remain private. With Family Sharing, you can also share Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple TV+, Apple News+, and Apple Card.

For complete details, don't forget to visit our guide on how to share iCloud storage on iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

If you've added an Apple Watch to your tech essentials, you can go beyond tracking your everyday health metrics and utilize your wearable for smarter integrations. First, just like your iPhone, you can use Apple Pay on your Apple Watch to make payments. You don't have to take the iPhone out of your pocket, just bring your Apple Watch near the NFC-enabled card reader, and you're done. When you set up Apple Pay on your iPhone, it offers an option to add the card to your Apple Watch. You can also do it later via the Watch app on your iPhone paired with Apple Watch.

In addition, you can also unlock your iPhone with your Apple Watch. It is super useful in situations when you're wearing a mask or FaceID isn't working on your iPhone. Besides the iPhone, you can also unlock your Mac with your Apple Watch. When you're wearing your Apple Watch, your Mac can sense when you're nearby and automatically logs you in. To make this work, make sure to enable Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on your devices. Now, go to System Settings -> Touch ID & Password and turn on the settings for your Apple Watch.

Apple's Find My app leverages the extensive Apple ecosystem, utilizing billions of devices to help you locate and track your belongings. With Apple's Find My, you can locate your lost or misplaced iPhone, Apple Watch, keys with AirTag, AirPods, and other devices associated with your Apple ID. Turning on Find My will give you peace of mind that you can always know where your devices are. Previously, you could track only 16 items. Now, you can track up to 32 items on the Find My app.

Last, but definitely not the least, you can use AirPlay to stream or share content from your iPhone or iPad to a bigger screen like Apple TV, a Mac, or an AirPlay-compatible smart TV. You can stream a video to amp up your binge-watching experience, share photos to enjoy some special moments with your family, or simply mirror your iPhone screen to boost productivity.

You can use the Handoff feature to stream video from your iPhone/iPad screen automatically. Alternatively, while playing a video on your iPhone, tap on the AirPlay icon and choose your Mac or TV from the list of available devices. Watching your iPhone content seamlessly mirrored on the Apple TV or Mac is a pure delight.

That's all for our side. The Apple ecosystem has been criticised for being a walled garden, but if you're in it, you just can't deny how beautiful and connected it is. Apple has built its entire ecosystem with the strong pillars of connectivity, simplicity, and security. It has revolutionised how seamlessly we can interact across different devices and different software.",Beebom,https://beebom.com/how-make-most-out-apple-ecosystem/,2024-12-10,
The iPhone in 2025: Apple May Have More Up Its Sleeve Than Usual Next Year,"Expertise Apple | Samsung | Google | Smartphones | Smartwatches | Wearables | Fitness trackers

Next year could end up being a big moment for the iPhone, potentially marking a few significant firsts for Apple's 16-year-old device.

Apple may release its first ""slim"" iPhone model, put its own 5G modems inside the iPhone for the first time and we may see the first iPhone SE with Face ID. Plus, we'll likely get a much closer look at Apple's AI plans for the iPhone, since the current wave of Apple Intelligence features feels like just the beginning.

There's a lot riding on Apple's plans for the iPhone in 2025. At a time when consumers are holding onto their phones for longer periods of time, it's harder than ever to entice iPhone users to upgrade. According to a CNET survey in partnership with YouGov, 44% of smartphone owners only buy a new phone when their current one needs replacing.

But with rumored new models like the iPhone 17 Slim and a redesigned cheaper iPhone, Apple could have an easier time exciting potential shoppers.

If it gets it right, that is. If Apple does release a significantly thinner iPhone, there's a chance that the extra-svelte design will come at a higher cost. And given the lukewarm reception Apple Intelligence has gotten so far, the pressure will be on Apple to impress consumers with new features next year.

Read more: Apple Watch Settings You Should Change for a Smoother Experience

While Samsung, Google and other Android phone makers offer screens that fold in half, Apple is sticking with the same traditional bar shape the iPhone has had since its inception. But the company is reportedly considering shaking up the iPhone's design in a different way: by making it significantly thinner.

Reports from The Information, Bloomberg and TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo indicate Apple may release a notably slimmer iPhone in 2025 instead of an iPhone 17 Plus.

The phone's sleek looks would be its main attraction; it would likely have similar specifications as the standard iPhone 17 otherwise but with a few compromises. For example, Kuo reports that this phone would have a single rear camera instead of the double camera found on the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus. It would also have the same processor as the base iPhone 17, according to the analyst.

The iPhone 17 Slim, if well received, could be just what Apple needs to get consumers excited about its non-Pro iPhones. That's to say, perhaps a snazzy redesign will coerce consumers to upgrade because they want to, not because they need to. Over the last two years, Apple's strategy has involved trickling features down from the Pro models, such as the Dynamic Island and the Action Button, to its standard iPhones to make them feel fresh and new compared to their predecessors.

But with the iPhone 17 Slim, Apple would be introducing an entirely new style of iPhone for the first time since 2022, back when it launched the first Plus. Still, that phone didn't feel as novel and original as the iPhone 17 Slim likely will. Instead of just changing the size of the screen, it sounds like Apple is rethinking the iPhone's design in a way that would make it feel more portable and premium than a regular iPhone, a value proposition that's not too different from that of a flip phone-style foldable phone. Flip phones, for example, stand out for their unconventional looks and more compact designs. If Apple were to release a sleeker iPhone, it would presumably check both of those boxes, too.

That said, there's a chance the iPhone 17 Slim will come with some tradeoffs, particularly around pricing since it could be more expensive than the Pro Max model, according to The Information. The phone's extreme thinness could also raise durability concerns, although it's impossible to know until Apple releases the product -- if it does at all. The device is said to be 6-millimeters thin, according to analyst Jeff Pu as MacRumors reported, which would make it notably sleeker than the 7.8mm iPhone 16.

Otherwise, the iPhone 17 lineup will likely come with fresh processors from Apple and screens with higher refresh rates across all four models (only the Pros have this feature currently), according to ETNews. All new iPhone models will also reportedly have a higher resolution 24-megapixel selfie camera, says analyst Jeff Pu per MacRumors.

The iPhone SE is expected to get a glow up. The fourth-generation of Apple's entry-level phone, which the company is expected to release in 2025, is said to have an edge-to-edge display like Apple's other iPhones, Face ID, the Action button, a 48-megapixel camera and Apple Intelligence, according to reports from MacRumors, Bloomberg and Kuo. That would represent a huge overhaul from the current model, released back in 2022, which looks like an iPhone 8 with the same chip as the iPhone 13.

Those changes alone could make the iPhone SE a compelling option for those looking to replace their current iPhone but don't need high-end specs like a smoother screen and additional camera. Android phones like the Google Pixel 8A have been leaving the iPhone SE in the dust in terms of design, screen size and camera capabilities, but it sounds like that could change with the next model.

There's another reason why the iPhone SE 4 could be particularly special: It may provide a peek at Apple's first cellular modem. Apple is reportedly developing its own modem, which is the component that enables phones to connect to cellular networks, to reduce its reliance on long term partner and rival Qualcomm, according to Bloomberg. The iPhone SE 4 will be the first Apple product with the modem when it launches next spring, the report says, before making its way to more premium devices.

Apple's first modem is said to be less capable than Qualcomm's; it won't, for example, support millimeter wave 5G, says Bloomberg. But the initiative would give Apple more control over its product development cycle, which could eventually result in new capabilities and better performance the same way its M-series chips have for the Mac.

Apple Intelligence, the company's first major push into consumer-facing AI, officially arrived in October, providing a glimpse into Apple's vision for how AI can make our phones more useful. But the first wave of features doesn't bring radical changes to the iPhone and neither will the second phase, which is expected to arrive soon. Apple Intelligence, in its current form, primarily consists of assistive tools for tasks such as erasing objects from photos, rewriting text and getting tech help from Siri.

But next year, Apple will start laying the groundwork for what could be a larger shift in how we use our phones -- primarily thanks to Siri. Apple's virtual helper will be able to incorporate personal context into responses, take action within apps and understand what's on your phone's screen to assist with answering questions.

Read more: I'm Not Impressed With AI on Phones Yet. What It Will Take to Change My Mind

Those changes could make Siri a far more capable virtual assistant and could perhaps set the stage for a broader shift towards the iPhone's software becoming more intelligent. Apple indeed has larger plans to revamp Siri with more sophisticated large language models (i.e. the same tech that fuels ChatGPT), according to Bloomberg. This new Siri would be capable of answering questions more quickly and in a more natural manner, more similar to Google's Gemini and OpenAI's ChatGPT.

But that overhaul isn't expected to arrive until 2026 even if Apple announces it next year, the report says. If accurate, this would mean Apple's true answer to OpenAI and Google's chatbot would come to the market much later than its competitors, putting more pressure on Apple's technology to be successful. But Apple sees this as a long-term play and would rather wait until it's perfected its own unique approach rather than rushing to catch up, which is its modus operandi.

""We view it sort of like multitouch, which enabled the smartphone revolution and the modern tablet,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook said to Wired's Steven Levy in a recent interview when asked if he had considered charging for Apple Intelligence.

Rumblings of an iPhone that bends in half have circulated for years, but don't expect to see one anytime soon. Bloomberg reports that a foldable iPad will likely come before a foldable iPhone, and both devices are likely still years away.

Android phone makers have looked to foldable designs as a means to reinvigorate the smartphone market amid stalling sales and longer upgrade cycles. But even though the market for foldable phones is expected to grow by 10.5% in 2024 according to the International Data Corporation, growth is slowing as phonemakers -- particularly those in China, where foldables are particularly popular -- are shifting their focus to generative AI.

Foldable phones can be beneficial for the right type of consumer, but their high prices make them hard to justify for most. Traditional phones are so ingrained in our lives that it's going to take a convincing argument to coerce shoppers into trying something new. The fact that Apple hasn't released a foldable phone yet -- and doesn't seem to be in a rush to do so -- suggests it may have the same perspective.

Until Apple publicly announces its new products, nothing is certain. But if the reports turn out to be true, 2025 will have much more in store than your average iPhone launch. Given that Apple has a reputation for showing consumers why new technologies are useful rather than being first, the expectations for new products like Apple Intelligence (and perhaps eventually a foldable iPhone) are particularly high.",CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/the-iphone-in-2025-apple-may-have-more-up-its-sleeve-than-usual-next-year/,2024-12-10,
iOS 18.2 RC 2: Get Ready For More Than Just AI Features on Your iPhone,"Apple software beta tester, ""Helps make our computers and phones work!"" - Zach's grandparents

Apple released the second iOS 18.2 release candidate to developers and beta testers on Dec. 9. The tech giant released the RC more than a month after the company released iOS 18.1 to the general public. While iOS 18.1 brought a few new features and fixes to all iPhones, and a few Apple Intelligence features to others, the RC brings more AI features to some developers and beta testers. There are also a few new features and upgrades in the RC that aren't a part of Apple Intelligence, so everyone can access them.

Read more: An Expert's Guide to iOS 18

Since this is still a beta, I recommend downloading it on something other than your primary device. Because this isn't the final version of iOS 18.2, the update might be buggy and battery life may be short, so it's best to keep those troubles on a secondary device.

Note that the RC is not the final version of iOS 18.2, so there could be more features to land on your iPhone when iOS 18.2 is released. There's no word on when Apple will release iOS 18.2 to the public, but Apple usually releases updates to the general public about a week or so after it releases an RC.

Here are some of the features that could land on your iPhone with iOS 18.2 soon. Just a reminder that only developers and beta testers who have an iPhone 15 Pro, Pro Max or the iPhone 16 lineup can access the AI features for now. If you have any other iPhone, you won't have access to those features.

The Find My app can be used to locate things like your AirPods and MacBook, and with the iOS 18.2 RC, Apple makes it easy for everyone to get help finding lost items. In the RC, if you go into Find My > Items and tap one of your items, you have two new options: Share Item Location and Show Contact Info.

If you enable Share Item Location, Find My will create a link that you can share with others so they can notify you if they find your lost or missing item. This could be especially helpful as we head into the holidays as more people are traveling and losing luggage at airports or leaving items behind. These links expire after one week, though, which may not be enough time to find them.

If you enable Show Contact Info, others can connect to lost items so they can find ways to contact you and bring your item back to you.

The Mail app on every iPhone also gets an upgrade in the iOS 18.2 RC. Apple announced in September that Mail would soon be able to sort emails to multiple categories to keep your important emails in one place and ads or promotions in another, like Gmail and Outlook do. The new layout keeps things mostly tidy, but Mail doesn't always get it right. For example, I found an email for digital tickets I previously ordered in the Promotions category rather than the Primary category.

You don't have to use the new layout if you don't want to. To change your Mail layout back, go into Mail, tap the three dots (...) in the top right corner and tap List View.

Apple previously removed the volume slider on the iPhone's lock screen. You could still use the volume buttons on the side of your iPhone, but it wasn't as precise as the slider. With the iOS 18.2 RC, though, you can add the slider back to your lock screen.

Go to Settings > Accessibility > Audio and Visual and tap the toggle next to Always Show Volume Control. Now, whether you're listening to a podcast or music from one of Apple's apps or a third-party app the volume slider will be present on your lock screen.

If you have kids who like to play games or watch videos on their iPhones and they set the music to full blast, that could damage their device's speakers -- not to mention it could be annoying to you. With the iOS 18.2 RC, you can set a maximum volume limit on your or your kid's iPhone.

To set a limit go to Settings > Sounds & Haptics > Volume Limit and tap the toggle next to Limit Maximum Volume. A scale will appear and you can select what you want the limit to be. Apple does note that this limit doesn't apply to things like phone calls, FaceTime calls, emergency calls or Find My sounds.

There are over 3,000 emoji you can use, but sometimes you can't find the one you really want. Genmoji is here to help. With the Apple Intelligence Genmoji feature, you can describe the emoji you're looking for and iPhones with Apple Intelligence will attempt to generate a new emoji based on your description.

To use Genmoji, go into a message and tap the emoji keyboard in the bottom left corner of your keyboard. Then, type the emoji you're looking for into the search bar. If there isn't an emoji that matches your description, tap Create New Emoji just below the search bar. Your iPhone will then show you a few examples of what it came up with based on your description. You can swipe through the emoji, and when you find a Genmoji you like, tap Add in the top right corner to permanently add that new emoji to your keyboard.

This is Apple's answer to Google Lens. Visual Intelligence is an Apple Intelligence feature that lets you point your camera at something, like a dog, and your iPhone will then use the photo to search online to help you identify it. The feature can also be used to detect phone numbers to create contacts, scan QR codes and translate languages.

You can also integrate this feature with ChatGPT to help you identify items, as well as to help you better understand what's on a page or screen. It's important to note that you don't need a ChatGPT account to use the integration.

This feature is also only available on the iPhone 16 lineup since it utilizes the series' new camera control side-button. If you have one of the new iPhones, long press the new side-button where the SIM card tray used to be to quickly pull up Visual Intelligence.

""The camera control provides instant, easy access to the camera with just a click. It allows you to adjust various camera features simply by sliding your finger,"" Apple said at its Glowtime event in September. ""Its convenient design ensures it's always within reach.""

This Apple Intelligence feature takes Genmoji one step further and lets you create whole images based on text prompts called Image Playground. This feature is a standalone app and it can also be found in Message by tapping the plus (+) button to the left of your text box.

Image Playground is filled with prompt suggestions, themes, places and more to get you started. You can enter multiple prompts to make the image more specific, but once I entered seven prompts a popup appeared telling me to use fewer. There's also an option to change the art style from the default cartoony 3D images to illustrations.

If you want to put yourself, friends and family or your pet into one of these images, you can. Tap the plus (+) sign in the bottom right corner and then tap either Choose Photo or Take Photo. You'll still have to choose or enter a prompt in addition to the photo.

The feature can create some simple images, and it can be unintentionally funny with how weird other images are. In one instance, I selected the prompts astronaut, artist and lighthouse. One of the results showed what I can only describe as a half-stronaut propped up on an easel surrounded by frames opposite another easel with a drawing of a lighthouse on it. Stellar work.

You can also draw a sketch in Notes, select your sketch and use it with Visual Playground. That way you can either clean up your sketch, or if you're not an artist -- like myself -- you can use the feature to flesh out your sketch.

Apple announced at WWDC in May that its virtual assistant Siri was soon entering a ""new era"" thanks to Apple Intelligence enhancements. With the iOS 18.2 RC, Apple is bringing most of those enhancements to some iPhones.

With Apple Intelligence, instead of seeing a logo pop up on your screen when you activate Siri, you'll see a glowing light around your screen. You can use Siri like you normally would, and you can also use ChatGPT for your queries.

I asked Siri to use ChatGPT to show me how to brew a cup of coffee, and it wrote out a seven-step process on how to make drip coffee in a standard brewer. The instructions were a little wonky, telling me to measure out my water and coffee grounds before grinding my coffee beans. There is a disclaimer at the bottom of these ChatGPT requests that reads, ""Check important info for mistakes.""

You can also copy what Siri and ChatGPT show you by tapping a button in the top right corner of the window that shows two pieces of paper. Then, you can paste this in a message or a note if you want -- but again, you should verify the details of your request.

If you have any phones from the iPhone 16 lineup, you have the Camera Control button. You have to press this twice to open your camera if your screen is asleep or inactive, but Apple introduced a new toggle in the iOS 18.2 RC so that you can press the Camera Control once to open your camera even if your screen is off.

To do this, go to Settings > Display & Brightness and tap the toggle next to Require Screen On to disable the feature. Now if you press the Camera Control while your screen is off, your iPhone will open your Camera without a second press. However, it could also lead to accidentally opening your camera more often.

Here are the full release notes for the iOS 18.2 RC.

Apple Intelligence (All iPhone 16 models, iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max)

4. Image Wand turns sketches and handwritten or typed notes into images in Notes.

Change is scary, but a change as seismic as going from an Android phone to an iPhone is something that shouldn't be taken lightly. Sure, I'm kidding. But only a little bit, because it's a shift that affects many lives daily. Think about how much time you spend on your phone each day -- if you're like me, it's a ton. All the texting and scrolling means you're spending many hours working within an operating system.

There are many apps that work for both Android and iOS, so when it comes to using software, the experience may not be as different. But there are plenty of apps that don't work for one or the other, so you're opening up your world to a lot of new possibilities. Going from Android to iOS may actually take a little bit more getting used to because of the complexities of an iPhone.

Differences between iOS and Android

The culture switch can be a lot to handle

Most people just focus on the colors of the text bubbles on their iPhone when they think of the differences between iOS and Android. It's one of the most recognizable things when someone is texting you in iOS, as Android users' messages appear in green bubbles, while iMessages from other iPhone users show up in blue.

However, the differences between these operating systems go far beyond text bubble colors. Apple is known for having better software updates and introducing bug fixes in a more timely fashion, but you can customize your Android phone much more easily, which is similar to a PC being more customizable than a MacBook.

AI-powered features are usually powered by Google Gemini on an Android phone. It's more readily available on a variety of Android phones, while Apple Intelligence -- Apple's suite of AI-powered tools -- is only built into the new iPhone 16 lineup. iOS is lauded for its security and privacy features, and integration is simple between Apple devices.

Because of Android's open-source nature, many different companies can make Android phones, so it can be harder to integrate between the devices. You'll probably notice that the customer service is slightly easier to deal with when it comes to Apple, though getting an appointment at an Apple Store can be difficult.

Apple's consistent stock performance demonstrates its resilience and market dominance. Investors see Apple's ability to deliver value as a testament to its robust business strategy, making it a cornerstone stock in many portfolios.

Financial Results and Future Outlook

Apple's Q4 fiscal 2024 results were stellar, with revenue hitting a record $94.9 billion, a 6% year-over-year increase. Earnings per shareEarnings per share (EPS) is a fundamental financial metric that provides valuable insights into a company's profitability.

Strong financial performance solidifies Apple's position as a reliable investment. The company's ability to consistently grow revenue and earnings even in a challenging macroeconomic environment highlights its operational excellence and market resilience.

Product and Technology Updates

Apple's innovation pipeline continues to impress, with the iPhone 16 launch marking the beginning of a ""super cycle."" This product cycle is expected to drive significant growth as customers upgrade to the latest technology. Additionally, the company is set to launch its in-house cellular modem chips in spring 2025, starting with the iPhone SE. Apple is also advancing its artificial intelligence capabilities with ""Apple Intelligence,"" aimed at enhancing user experiences across its ecosystem of devices.

Apple's ability to innovate ensures it remains competitive in the fast-evolving tech industry. The introduction of proprietary technologies like in-house modem chips and enhanced AI capabilities positions Apple for long-term growth and margin improvements.

Market Position and Analyst Predictions

Apple continues to dominate multiple sectors, including smartphones, personal computers, smartwatches, and tablets. Analysts have varied perspectives on Apple's stock outlook. Some predict the stock could reach $415 in two years, presenting a potential 73% upside from current levels. Others adopt a more conservative approach, with a price target of $262.67.

Market analysts are forecasting that Apple's revenue for the fiscal year 2025 will reach an impressive $415 billion, concluding in September of that year.

Apple's diverse product portfolio and strong market share across key technology segments make it a stable and attractive option for investors. While analysts may differ in their projections, the consensus is that Apple remains a leader in innovation and profitability.

How Does the iPhone Impact AAPL Stock's Value?

The iPhone plays a crucial role in influencing AAPL stock's value due to its central position in the company's product ecosystem. As the flagship product, the iPhone serves as a major revenue driver. While the smartphone market matures, the profitability of releasing new versions, although significant, can be outpaced by the introduction of groundbreaking devices or technologies that diversify revenue streams.

Sales and Upgrade Cycles

Global Considerations

The company's production and sales strategies, heavily influenced by international markets like China, pose both opportunities and challenges. Dependence on manufacturing and sales partnerships in these regions can affect supply chains and market performance, which in turn impacts stock value.

Innovation and Market Perception

The iPhone's success sets high expectations for future innovations. While groundbreaking devices can drive stock prices upward, reliance on evolutionary product updates might not provide the same boost.

The iPhone's impact on AAPL stock is multifaceted, involving steady revenue from upgrades, cross-product integration, and global market dynamics. Its influence remains pivotal in shaping investor perceptions and the company's financial health.

How Apple's Service Segment Fuels Growth

Apple's service segment has emerged as a powerhouse in driving the company's growth. In the latest quarter, it generated an impressive $25 billion in revenue. This encompasses a wide array of services, including iTunes, digital content, AppleCare, Apple Pay, and various licensing deals.

Diversifying Revenue Streams

This diverse portfolio plays a critical role in Apple's future expansion. By focusing on services, Apple is creating a robust secondary revenue stream that complements its hardware sales. This strategy helps mitigate risks associated with the cyclical nature of the tech industry, especially as Apple's devices saturate the market.

The Strategic Importance

The service segment's significance cannot be overstated. It represents a stable growth avenue, ensuring that even if hardware sales waver, the company's overall growth trajectory remains strong. This dual-line approach not only sustains current financial performance but also secures a foundation for long-term prosperity.

How is Apple Expanding Into New Markets?

Apple is implementing several strategies to broaden its reach in global markets, focusing particularly on regions with untapped potential.

Flexible Payment Options

One key approach involves providing installment plans. By allowing customers to pay for products over time, Apple makes its offerings more accessible in markets where high upfront costs might be a barrier.

Targeting Emerging Economies

Another vital strategy is aiming for deeper market penetration in emerging economies. By tailoring their approach to these regions' unique needs and economic conditions, Apple positions itself to capture a broader audience.

Expanding Operational Presence

Additionally, Apple is enhancing its operational footprint in crucial areas like Europe and China. By establishing a stronger local presence, the company can better understand and cater to the diverse preferences of these markets.

Apple's expansion is driven by flexible payment options and strategic market penetration, enabling it to connect with a wider, global audience.

Exploring Apple's Potential Entry into the Automotive Market by 2025

The question of whether Apple could enter the automotive market by 2025 is intriguing. Apple recently pivoted from its ambitious self-driving car project, which had the potential to put it head-to-head with automotive giants like Tesla. After nearly a decade of exploration and development, the company has chosen a different route.

Instead of pursuing its own vehicle, Apple plans to integrate the technological advancements from its project into existing products. This includes enhancing innovations such as Apple CarPlay and possibly influencing other areas within its technological ecosystem. While a full-fledged Apple car may not hit the roads by 2025, the learnings and tech advancements from its automotive explorations will likely impact various aspects of Apple's offerings.

Given the rapid evolution of technology and Apple's renowned ability to pivot successfully, it remains a possibility. However, it seems their immediate focus will be on embedding automotive intelligence rather than launching a standalone vehicle.

Potential Challenges for Apple in 2025

As we look towards 2025, Apple is not likely to struggle with maintaining its presence or generating substantial revenue. The company has established itself firmly across various sectors. However, the real challenge lies not in survival but in justifying its high stock valuation to investors.

In its earlier days, Apple captured global attention by consistently delivering groundbreaking technology and innovations. As a mature company, maintaining this level of excitement is significantly more demanding. Investors are no longer swayed simply by being great; they demand consistent evidence of growth relative to the company's already substantial valuation.

This situation creates a critical question: how can Apple continue to convince the market of its worth? The company needs to navigate the complexities of being a mature entity while still finding avenues for growth that satisfy investor expectations. Balancing between incremental innovation and groundbreaking advancements remains a key concern as they strive to uphold their market-leading status and prove their value to Wall Street.

Is Apple's Stock Considered Safe for Long-Term Investment?

When it comes to stock market investing, the concept of ""safety"" is often a matter of perspective rather than fact. Apple's stock, like many others in the market, has experienced its fair share of volatility. Historically, it has endured significant downturns, including periods where the stock value dropped by as much as 50% or more. At its worst, there was an 81% decline from peak to trough, highlighting the inherent risks.

In more recent times, during the market turbulence of 2022, the broader S&P 500 index experienced an 18% decline, yet Apple saw a more substantial decrease of 26%. This clearly indicates that the stock is not insulated from broader economic challenges and market fluctuations.

Despite these numbers, Apple boasts a strong financial foundation. This robust financial health acts as a solid buffer, providing a degree of reassurance to long-term investors. While the stock is not immune to market volatility, its stability over the very long term can appeal to investors with patience and a long-term outlook.

While Apple's stock cannot be deemed ""safe"" in the traditional sense due to its volatility, its underlying financial strength may present a beneficial aspect for those willing to invest over an extended period.

Conclusion

Apple's exceptional stock performance, robust financial results, and strategic innovations reaffirm its status as a dominant player in the tech industry. For investors, Apple represents a compelling opportunity to invest in a company that continues to set benchmarks in innovation and market leadership. With the potential for further growth and new product launches on the horizon, Apple is well-positioned to remain a top choice for long-term investment.",Guerilla Stock Trading,https://www.guerillastocktrading.com/apple-stock-trading-plan/,2024-12-08,

iOS 18.2即将发布 大量AI功能值得关注_手机网易网,"iOS 18.2 候选发布版本已经发布，苹果公司正在为该软件的全面公开发布做准备。 以下是您需要了解的有关该更新及其功能的所有信息。本周四，在第四个开发者测试版发布两周后，苹果部署了iOS 18.2 的候选发布版构建。 虽然该更新可安装在 iPhone XR 和 iPhone XS 等设备上，但该软件包含的各种功能仅适用于 iPhone 15 Pro 、iPhone 15 Pro Max 和 iPhone 16 系列。

Apple Intelligence 使生成式 AI 软件在文本编辑、校对、 摘要以及音调调整等方面的应用成为可能。 这些功能可通过 iOS、iPadOS 和macOS 上的专用写作工具框架在全系统范围内使用，而 iOS 18.2 将带来更多由人工智能驱动的功能。

该软件扩展了最初随 iOS 18.1 推出的书写工具的现有功能。 iOS 18.2 更新提供了许多与图像生成相关的全新 Apple Intelligence 功能，以及各种其他改进。

iOS 18.2 为写作工具和 Siri 带来了 ChatGPT

从 iOS 18.2 开始，Siri 可以将问题和请求转发至 ChatGPT。 OpenAI 的软件还为写作工具中的新文本合成功能提供了支持。 这意味着用户可以要求 ChatGPT 直接从 iOS 中生成文本或回答问题，而无需使用第三方应用程序或网站。

iOS 18.2 引入了 ChatGPT 集成

ChatGPT 集成的引入考虑到了用户隐私，因为所有请求都是匿名发送的。 使用基本功能不需要 ChatGPT 帐户，用户可随时免费使用这些功能。

不过，高级 ChatGPT 功能只能在有限范围内使用。 作为 iOS 18.2 更新的一部分，用户将能看到自己是否超过了 ChatGPT 高级功能的每日限额。

一旦超过高级功能限制，其他请求将被发送到基本版 ChatGPT，最长持续 24 小时。 现在，想要获得更多功能的用户可以直接从""设置""应用升级到 ChatGPT Plus，月费 19.99 美元。 Siri 通过 ChatGPT Plus 获得了获取实时信息的能力，虚拟助手也可以通过 ChatGPT 分享屏幕截图。

值得注意的是，ChatGPT 集成仅适用于已经支持Apple Intelligence的设备，如 iPhone 16 系列。 在 iOS 18.2 更新中，苹果还加入了针对这些设备的新设置。

iOS 18.2 在 iPhone 16 系列上启用视觉智能

iOS 18.2 为相机控制引入了各种设置，相机控制在 iPhone 16 系列中首次亮相。 相机控制是一个全新的硬件组件，是一个带有电容表面和力度传感器的按钮。 该按钮可通过一项名为""视觉智能""（Visual Intelligence）的全新功能与Apple Intelligence系统结合使用。

视觉智能功能适用于运行 iOS 18.2 的 iPhone 16 机型

有了视觉智能功能，用户可以点击并按住相机控制按钮，同时将 iPhone 16 对准感兴趣的物体或位置。 这反过来又会通过苹果公司的人工智能生成软件为用户提供有用的信息。

例如，用户可以将设备指向一家餐厅，然后就能获得该餐厅的评级或工作时间等详细信息。 同样，还可以从传单中添加日历事件，或根据品种识别狗的身份。

为 iPhone 16 用户提供更多相机控制设置

iOS 18.2 中还有与相机控制及其功能相关的新设置。 用户现在可以调整相机控制的双击速度。 除了 Default 选项外，双击速度还可设置为 Slow 或 Slower 。

iOS 18.2 为 iPhone 16 的相机控制引入了更多设置

软件更新还新增了AE/AF Lock选项，可在拍照时锁定曝光和对焦。 相机控制功能可配置为轻按一下即可切换 AE/AF 锁定。 这意味着即使在iPhone左右移动时，曝光也会保持一致，图像也不会变暗。

Apple 添加了一个新的自定义选项，让您在屏幕关闭的情况下也能打开相机应用。 在Settings > Display and Brightness中，现在有一个名为Require Screen On的选项，该选项默认为启用。 禁用该选项后，即使设备的显示屏当前处于关闭状态，您也可以通过相机控制来激活相机应用。

苹果Image Playground - 一款全新的全系统 AI 图像生成工具

iOS 18.2 引入了图像游乐场，这是一个全新的系统应用程序，可让用户通过人工智能创建图像。

Image Playground 利用人工智能根据用户的要求生成图像

在 Image Playground 应用程序中，用户可以写下他们希望看到的图像描述，然后让人工智能生成图像。 这可以是他们认识的人、风景、物体或任何介于两者之间的图像。 不过，该软件有防护措施，因此无法创建受版权保护的人物或不恰当内容的图像。

创建的图像有两种风格：动画和插图。 在 Image Playground 中创建的内容无论如何都不会过于逼真。 苹果公司还确保用该应用生成的所有图像都标明了真实图像，这样就不会被误认为是真实世界的照片了。

Image Playground 可以生成用户认识的人的图像

Image Playground 允许您生成分辨率为 1024 x 1024 的图像。 这些图片保存在本地，并可像其他照片一样在 iPhone、iPad 或 Mac 上共享。 一项名为 Image Wand 的类似功能可让用户根据在备忘应用中找到的文本创建图像。 输入或手写文本可以通过人工智能变成图像。

Image Playground 与 Freeform、Keynote、Messages 和 Pages 等系统应用以及第三方应用进行了集成。 通过它，用户可以创建所谓的 Genmojis 以及其他类型的图像。

在 iOS 18.2 上使用Apple Intelligence创建自定义""Genmoji

有了 iOS 18.2，用户可以直接在 iOS 键盘上创建独特的表情符号。 这些自定义表情符号被称为 Genmoji，可通过 iCloud 进行同步，并在所有兼容设备的用户贴纸抽屉中显示。

在 iOS 18.2 中，用户可以创建所谓的 Genmoji

用户只需描述他们想要创建的表情符号，例如基于某个物体或某个熟人的表情符号，Apple Intelligence系统就会将其变为现实。 Genmoji 可以使用照片应用中的源图像来创建，也可以使用通用的 emoji 人来代替。

不过，Genmoji 不一定必须是人，因为它们可以由各种物体组成，包括真实的和想象的物体，这完全取决于最终用户的创造力。

邮件应用软件中提供设备上电子邮件分类功能

邮件应用在 iOS 18.2 中获得了重大更新，因为 Apple 的内置电子邮件应用现在可以将电子邮件按预定义的类别进行分类。 邮件分类是在 WWDC 2024 上预览的主要改进之一，现在终于实现了。

在 iOS 18.2 上，苹果的邮件应用可以将电子邮件按预定义的类别进行分类

通过机器学习，内置的邮件应用可以将电子邮件分为以下类别：

主要--显示时间敏感信息、来自用户可能认识的人的电子邮件以及其他重要信息

交易--收据和订单确认的电子邮件类别

更新 - 包含新闻简报和社交媒体通知

促销--用于营销和销售相关的电子邮件

邮件应用现在具有全新的摘要视图，可显示来自特定公司的所有电子邮件，从而大大方便了与这些邮件的交互。

有了摘要视图，用户就可以获得特定公司的航班信息等。 用户还可以调整发件人显示的邮件类别。 应用徽章也有了新的选项，用户可以选择是只显示主要未读邮件，还是显示所有未读邮件。

虽然Apple Intelligence及其相关功能无疑是 iOS 18.2 更新的主要组成部分，但该软件还包含与人工智能无关的各种改进。 具体来说，iOS 18.2 包含 FindMy、照片等新功能。

FindMy 现在可让您共享丢失的 AirTags 的位置

FindMy 在 iOS 18.2 中获得了重大更新，该软件现在可让用户与他们信任的人共享丢失物品的位置。

FindMy 在 iOS 18.2 中获得了重大改进

当AirTag或其他物品丢失时，用户可以选择与可信赖的个人甚至航空公司共享物品的位置，以便更轻松地找回丢失的物品。 这对于丢失的行李尤其有用，不过在某些情况下，配备 FindMy 的设备也 帮助当局找到被盗车辆。

丢失物品的位置会以链接的形式共享。 链接接收者可以在有限的时间内看到 AirTag 的位置、序列号以及用户的 Apple 账户电子邮件或电话号码。 一旦找到物品或物品位置链接过期，位置共享将自动停止。

AirPods Pro 2 的听力健康功能现在可在更多国家使用

iOS 18.2 还扩大了AirPods Pro 2无线耳塞的听力健康功能的可用性。 具体而言，听力测试功能现在可在塞浦路斯、捷克、法国、意大利、卢森堡、罗马尼亚、西班牙、阿拉伯联合酋长国和英国使用。 同时，临床级助听器功能已在阿拉伯联合酋长国推出。

AirPods Pro 2 的听力健康功能现已在更多国家/地区推出

Hearing Health 功能最初是在 2024 年 9 月获得FDA 批准后，随 iOS 18.1 更新在美国推出的。 在 AirPods Pro 2 上，这些功能可让用户测试自己的听力，或在轻度至中度听力损失的情况下将设备用作助听器。

不过值得注意的是，AirPods Pro 2 需要运行 7B19 或更新的固件才能实现这些功能。 在尚未获得批准的国家或地区，这些功能将无法使用。

iOS 18.2 更新中的其他更改

操作系统还对""照片""应用中的视频播放进行了微调。 视频不再在开始播放时自动放大。 用户还可以选择逐帧浏览视频，并禁用视频播放的自动循环功能。

iPadOS 18.2 对 Apple TV 应用程序中的标签栏进行了改进

在 iPad 方面，iPadOS 18.2 为 Apple TV 应用程序引入了一个值得注意的变化。 应用内的标签栏可进行自定义，现在侧边栏中的项目也可添加到标签栏中。

某些系统应用程序和功能也进行了小幅更新：

Apple Music 和 Apple TV - 新的自然搜索功能可让用户更轻松地按演员、年代、类型、情绪等搜索内容。

Face ID - 通过 iPhone 信任电脑时，现在可以使用 Face ID 代替用户的密码进行身份验证。

iPhone 镜像 - 即使 Mac 将 iPhone 用作个人热点，用户也可以镜像 iPhone 屏幕。

另一方面，visionOS 2.2 对 Mac 虚拟显示功能进行了重大改进。 虽然 Apple Vision Pro 一直可用作 Mac 的外接显示器，但现在新增了两种显示模式： 超宽和宽屏幕。 据苹果公司称，新的 Ultrawide 设置相当于将两台 4K 显示器连接到 Mac 并排使用。

visionOS 2.2 对 Mac 虚拟显示功能进行了改进

苹果还使在 Apple Vision Pro 上同时观看多场体育比赛成为可能。 借助 visionOS 2.2，用户现在可以通过Apple TV+ 订阅同时观看多达 5 场 MLB 或 MLS 比赛。 虽然目前还不能观看其他体育比赛，但 Apple 在 visionOS 2.2 中增加了SharePlay集成，让耳机用户可以一起观看比赛。

在 Apple Watch 上，watchOS 11.2 为相机遥控应用引入了一个新的暂停按钮。 这意味着现在可以通过 Apple Watch 上的 Camera Remote 应用程序，通过屏幕左侧的一个新按钮暂停 iPhone 上录制的视频。

不过，高级 ChatGPT 功能只能在有限范围内使用。 作为 iOS 18.2 更新的一部分，用户将能看到自己是否超过了 ChatGPT 高级功能的每日限额。

一旦超过高级功能限制，其他请求将被发送到基本版 ChatGPT，最长持续 24 小时。 现在，想要获得更多功能的用户可以直接从""设置""应用升级到 ChatGPT Plus，月费 19.99 美元。 Siri 通过 ChatGPT Plus 获得了获取实时信息的能力，虚拟助手也可以通过 ChatGPT 分享屏幕截图。

值得注意的是，ChatGPT 集成仅适用于已经支持Apple Intelligence的设备，如 iPhone 16 系列。 在 iOS 18.2 更新中，苹果还加入了针对这些设备的新设置。

iOS 18.2 在 iPhone 16 系列上启用视觉智能

iOS 18.2 为相机控制引入了各种设置，相机控制在 iPhone 16 系列中首次亮相。 相机控制是一个全新的硬件组件，是一个带有电容表面和力度传感器的按钮。 该按钮可通过一项名为""视觉智能""（Visual Intelligence）的全新功能与Apple Intelligence系统结合使用。

视觉智能功能适用于运行 iOS 18.2 的 iPhone 16 机型

有了视觉智能功能，用户可以点击并按住相机控制按钮，同时将 iPhone 16 对准感兴趣的物体或位置。 这反过来又会通过苹果公司的人工智能生成软件为用户提供有用的信息。

例如，用户可以将设备指向一家餐厅，然后就能获得该餐厅的评级或工作时间等详细信息。 同样，还可以从传单中添加日历事件，或根据品种识别狗的身份。

为 iPhone 16 用户提供更多相机控制设置

iOS 18.2 中还有与相机控制及其功能相关的新设置。 用户现在可以调整相机控制的双击速度。 除了 Default 选项外，双击速度还可设置为 Slow 或 Slower 。

iOS 18.2 为 iPhone 16 的相机控制引入了更多设置

软件更新还新增了AE/AF Lock选项，可在拍照时锁定曝光和对焦。 相机控制功能可配置为轻按一下即可切换 AE/AF 锁定。 这意味着即使在iPhone左右移动时，曝光也会保持一致，图像也不会变暗。

Apple 添加了一个新的自定义选项，让您在屏幕关闭的情况下也能打开相机应用。 在Settings > Display and Brightness中，现在有一个名为Require Screen On的选项，该选项默认为启用。 禁用该选项后，即使设备的显示屏当前处于关闭状态，您也可以通过相机控制来激活相机应用。

苹果Image Playground - 一款全新的全系统 AI 图像生成工具

iOS 18.2 引入了图像游乐场，这是一个全新的系统应用程序，可让用户通过人工智能创建图像。

Image Playground 利用人工智能根据用户的要求生成图像

在 Image Playground 应用程序中，用户可以写下他们希望看到的图像描述，然后让人工智能生成图像。 这可以是他们认识的人、风景、物体或任何介于两者之间的图像。 不过，该软件有防护措施，因此无法创建受版权保护的人物或不恰当内容的图像。

创建的图像有两种风格：动画和插图。 在 Image Playground 中创建的内容无论如何都不会过于逼真。 苹果公司还确保用该应用生成的所有图像都标明了真实图像，这样就不会被误认为是真实世界的照片了。

Image Playground 可以生成用户认识的人的图像

Image Playground 允许您生成分辨率为 1024 x 1024 的图像。 这些图片保存在本地，并可像其他照片一样在 iPhone、iPad 或 Mac 上共享。 一项名为 Image Wand 的类似功能可让用户根据在备忘应用中找到的文本创建图像。 输入或手写文本可以通过人工智能变成图像。

Image Playground 与 Freeform、Keynote、Messages 和 Pages 等系统应用以及第三方应用进行了集成。 通过它，用户可以创建所谓的 Genmojis 以及其他类型的图像。

在 iOS 18.2 上使用Apple Intelligence创建自定义""Genmoji

有了 iOS 18.2，用户可以直接在 iOS 键盘上创建独特的表情符号。 这些自定义表情符号被称为 Genmoji，可通过 iCloud 进行同步，并在所有兼容设备的用户贴纸抽屉中显示。

在 iOS 18.2 中，用户可以创建所谓的 Genmoji

用户只需描述他们想要创建的表情符号，例如基于某个物体或某个熟人的表情符号，Apple Intelligence系统就会将其变为现实。 Genmoji 可以使用照片应用中的源图像来创建，也可以使用通用的 emoji 人来代替。

不过，Genmoji 不一定必须是人，因为它们可以由各种物体组成，包括真实的和想象的物体，这完全取决于最终用户的创造力。

邮件应用软件中提供设备上电子邮件分类功能

邮件应用在 iOS 18.2 中获得了重大更新，因为 Apple 的内置电子邮件应用现在可以将电子邮件按预定义的类别进行分类。 邮件分类是在 WWDC 2024 上预览的主要改进之一，现在终于实现了。

在 iOS 18.2 上，苹果的邮件应用可以将电子邮件按预定义的类别进行分类

通过机器学习，内置的邮件应用可以将电子邮件分为以下类别：

主要--显示时间敏感信息、来自用户可能认识的人的电子邮件以及其他重要信息

交易--收据和订单确认的电子邮件类别

更新 - 包含新闻简报和社交媒体通知

促销--用于营销和销售相关的电子邮件

邮件应用现在具有全新的摘要视图，可显示来自特定公司的所有电子邮件，从而大大方便了与这些邮件的交互。

有了摘要视图，用户就可以获得特定公司的航班信息等。 用户还可以调整发件人显示的邮件类别。 应用徽章也有了新的选项，用户可以选择是只显示主要未读邮件，还是显示所有未读邮件。

虽然Apple Intelligence及其相关功能无疑是 iOS 18.2 更新的主要组成部分，但该软件还包含与人工智能无关的各种改进。 具体来说，iOS 18.2 包含 FindMy、照片等新功能。

FindMy 现在可让您共享丢失的 AirTags 的位置

FindMy 在 iOS 18.2 中获得了重大更新，该软件现在可让用户与他们信任的人共享丢失物品的位置。

当AirTag或其他物品丢失时，用户可以选择与可信赖的个人甚至航空公司共享物品的位置，以便更轻松地找回丢失的物品。 这对于丢失的行李尤其有用，不过在某些情况下，配备 FindMy 的设备也 帮助当局找到被盗车辆。

丢失物品的位置会以链接的形式共享。 链接接收者可以在有限的时间内看到 AirTag 的位置、序列号以及用户的 Apple 账户电子邮件或电话号码。 一旦找到物品或物品位置链接过期，位置共享将自动停止。

AirPods Pro 2 的听力健康功能现在可在更多国家使用

iOS 18.2 还扩大了AirPods Pro 2无线耳塞的听力健康功能的可用性。 具体而言，听力测试功能现在可在塞浦路斯、捷克、法国、意大利、卢森堡、罗马尼亚、西班牙、阿拉伯联合酋长国和英国使用。 同时，临床级助听器功能已在阿拉伯联合酋长国推出。

AirPods Pro 2 的听力健康功能现已在更多国家/地区推出

Hearing Health 功能最初是在 2024 年 9 月获得FDA 批准后，随 iOS 18.1 更新在美国推出的。 在 AirPods Pro 2 上，这些功能可让用户测试自己的听力，或在轻度至中度听力损失的情况下将设备用作助听器。

不过值得注意的是，AirPods Pro 2 需要运行 7B19 或更新的固件才能实现这些功能。 在尚未获得批准的国家或地区，这些功能将无法使用。

iOS 18.2 更新中的其他更改

操作系统还对""照片""应用中的视频播放进行了微调。 视频不再在开始播放时自动放大。 用户还可以选择逐帧浏览视频，并禁用视频播放的自动循环功能。

iPadOS 18.2 对 Apple TV 应用程序中的标签栏进行了改进

在 iPad 方面，iPadOS 18.2 为 Apple TV 应用程序引入了一个值得注意的变化。 应用内的标签栏可进行自定义，现在侧边栏中的项目也可添加到标签栏中。

某些系统应用程序和功能也进行了小幅更新：

Apple Music 和 Apple TV - 新的自然搜索功能可让用户更轻松地按演员、年代、类型、情绪等搜索内容。

Face ID - 通过 iPhone 信任电脑时，现在可以使用 Face ID 代替用户的密码进行身份验证。

iPhone 镜像 - 即使 Mac 将 iPhone 用作个人热点，用户也可以镜像 iPhone 屏幕。

播客 - 新增收藏类别选项和个性化搜索页面。

备注 - 新增""创建图片""按钮，在选择文本时显示。

Safari - Safari 开始页的新背景图片，以及文件下载的实时活动。

快捷方式 - 三个与健身应用程序相关的新快捷方式。

股票 - 盘前报价可让用户在开盘前跟踪纳斯达克和纽约证券交易所的股票行情

语音备忘录 - 支持分层录音，可用于为歌曲创意添加人声等。

杂项 - 现在可为犹他州的未成年人自动启用网页内容过滤器。

虽然本列表中有一些值得注意的改进，但绝大多数改进都是在现有应用程序及其功能的基础上进行的。 该软件还包含一些小的错误修复，详见苹果公司的发布说明。

visionOS 2.2 为 Mac 虚拟显示器带来宽屏和超宽屏视图，watchOS 11.2 新增暂停按钮

另一方面，visionOS 2.2 对 Mac 虚拟显示功能进行了重大改进。 虽然 Apple Vision Pro 一直可用作 Mac 的外接显示器，但现在新增了两种显示模式： 超宽和宽屏幕。 据苹果公司称，新的 Ultrawide 设置相当于将两台 4K 显示器连接到 Mac 并排使用。

visionOS 2.2 对 Mac 虚拟显示功能进行了改进

苹果还使在 Apple Vision Pro 上同时观看多场体育比赛成为可能。 借助 visionOS 2.2，用户现在可以通过Apple TV+ 订阅同时观看多达 5 场 MLB 或 MLS 比赛。 虽然目前还不能观看其他体育比赛，但 Apple 在 visionOS 2.2 中增加了SharePlay集成，让耳机用户可以一起观看比赛。

在 Apple Watch 上，watchOS 11.2 为相机遥控应用引入了一个新的暂停按钮。 这意味着现在可以通过 Apple Watch 上的 Camera Remote 应用程序，通过屏幕左侧的一个新按钮暂停 iPhone 上录制的视频。

不过，Apple Vision Pro 和 Apple Watch 平台仍然缺乏Apple Intelligence（Apple Intelligence）功能，这意味着它们的用户无法利用其他苹果平台上的各种人工智能功能。

iOS 18.2 预计将于 2024 年 12 月初发布，届时图像游乐场和视觉智能等功能将向所有用户开放。",cnBeta.COM,http://m.cnbeta.com.tw/view/1460794.htm,2024-12-06,
12 Reasons to Wait for Next Year's iPhone 17,"Apple's iPhone development roadmap runs several years into the future and the company is continually working with suppliers on several successive iPhone models simultaneously, which is why we sometimes get rumored feature leaks so far ahead of launch. The iPhone 17 series is no different - already we have some idea of what to expect from Apple's 2025 smartphone lineup.

If you plan to skip this year's iPhone 16, or if you're just plain curious about what's on the horizon, here are 12 rumored features that we are expecting to arrive in time for its successor, the iPhone 17 series, which is likely to be released in September 2025.

Apple plans to launch an all-new iPhone 17 model with a ""significantly thinner"" design, reports The Information. The device, which could be called ""iPhone 17 Air,"" will allegedly feature a ""major redesign"" that could feature a single rear camera located at the top-center of the device, along with a narrower Dynamic Island, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. However, one rumor claims the battery will be around 6mm thick, suggesting that the device itself will be thicker than this. Apple's thinnest ever iPhone was the iPhone 6 at 6.9mm, meaning that the iPhone 17 ""Air"" may not be much thinner than the 2014 flagship. The device is rumored to have a 6.5-inch display size, and may replace the iPhone 17 Plus model, but this is unconfirmed. Other potential features include an aluminum chassis, an A19 chip, an Apple-designed 5G modem, and an improved front camera. See our iPhone 17 ""Slim"" rumor roundup for more.

2. New All-Aluminum Design

All iPhone 17 Models

Apple is reportedly planning to bring all its devices back to aluminum with the iPhone 17 lineup. The two flagship iPhone 17 Pro models will mark the return of aluminum frames to high-end iPhones for the first time since Apple began distinguishing between Pro and non-Pro models. In recent years, aluminum frames have been reserved for lower-end devices like the iPhone SE and iPhone 16, while premium models featured stainless steel frames until the iPhone 15 Pro, which introduced a titanium chassis as a major upgrade. This shift in materials for the iPhone 17 lineup signals a unified approach, with aluminum frames set to return across the entire device range.

3. Rectangular Camera Bump

iPhone 17 Pro & iPhone 17 Pro Max

The iPhone 17 Pro models are rumored to feature a new rear design combining aluminum and glass. The top half of the back will be aluminum, incorporating a ""rectangular camera bump"" made from aluminum instead of the traditional 3D glass. The bottom half will remain glass to enable wireless charging. While Apple has used a glass back since the iPhone 8 and iPhone X in 2017, earlier iPhone models -- except the iPhone 3G, iPhone 3GS, and iPhone 5C -- had aluminum rears. Additionally, the aluminum camera bump on the iPhone 17 Pro will reportedly be larger than in previous models, according to The Information.

4. New Display Sizes

iPhone 17 & iPhone 17 Plus

This year's iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max got bigger display sizes, going from 6.12- and 6.69-inches to 6.27- and 6.86-inches, respectively. For 2025, Apple is also expected to bring the larger 6.27-inch display size to its standard iPhone model, while the equivalent ""iPhone 17 Plus"" model (provisionally called ""iPhone 17 Air"") could adopt completely new display dimensions.

5. 120Hz ProMotion (Always-on Display)

iPhone 17 & iPhone 17 Plus

Apple intends to expand ProMotion to all iPhone models in 2025, allowing all models to ramp up to a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling and video content when necessary. Previously, only ""Pro"" models in Apple's iPhone lineup have had the feature. Notably, ProMotion would also enable the display on the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 ""Air"" to ramp down to a more power-efficient refresh rate as low as 1Hz, allowing for an always-on display that can show the Lock Screen's clock, widgets, notifications, and wallpaper even when the device is locked.

Apple's premium 2025 models are expected to be equipped with an Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip for the first time. Wi-Fi 7 support would allow the ""Pro"" models to send and receive data over the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands simultaneously with a supported router, resulting in faster Wi-Fi speeds, lower latency, and more reliable connectivity. The Wi-Fi chip would also allow Apple to further reduce its dependance on external suppliers like Broadcom, which currently supplies Apple with a combined Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip for iPhones.

An upgraded 48-megapixel Telephoto lens on Apple's largest premium device is expected to be optimized for use with Apple's Vision Pro headset. That would make 2025's ""Pro Max"" the first iPhone to have a rear camera system composed entirely of 48-megapixel lenses, making it capable of capturing even more photographic detail.

The iPhone 17 lineup will feature a 24-megapixel front-facing camera with a six-element lens, according to one rumor. The iPhone 14 and 15 feature a 12-megapixel front-facing camera with five plastic lens elements, and this year's iPhone 16 lineup features the same hardware. The upgraded resolution to 24 megapixels on the iPhone 17 will allow photos to maintain their quality even when cropped or zoomed in, while the larger number of pixels will capture finer details. The upgrade to a six-element lens should also slightly enhance image quality.

The iPhone 17 will feature an anti-reflective display that is more scratch-resistant than Apple's Ceramic Shield found on iPhone 15 models, according to one rumor, although the new iPhone 16 Pro models do have the latest-generation Ceramic Shield, which has an advanced formulation that is 2x tougher than glass on any other smartphone. The outer glass on the iPhone 17 is said to have a ""super-hard anti-reflective layer"" that is ""more scratch-resistant."" It's not clear whether Apple is planning to adopt the Gorilla Glass Armor that Samsung uses in its Galaxy S24 Ultra, but the description of Corning's latest technology matches the rumor.

At least one model in Apple's iPhone 17 lineup will come with 12GB. Jeff Pu of investment firm Haitong has claimed that both Pro models will come with the upped RAM, while Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes only the iPhone 17 Pro Max will feature 12GB. In contrast, another reliable source has claimed that all iPhone 17 models will have 12GB of RAM. For comparison, the standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus have 6GB of RAM, and the iPhone 15 Pro models have 8GB of RAM, while all iPhone 16 models have 8GB of RAM. Any such increase would allow for improved multitasking on the iPhone, as well as provide additional resources for Apple Intelligence features that require large-language models to be resident in memory.

Apple's highest-end 2025 iPhone will feature a significantly narrower Dynamic Island, thanks to the device's adoption of a smaller ""metalens"" for the Face ID system, claims Haitong's Jeff Pu. While a traditional iPhone camera has curved lenses that redirect light towards the image sensor, a metalens is a thin and flat lens with microscopic patterns etched onto it that can focus light more precisely. Assuming this results in a narrowed Dynamic Island , it would be the first time that Apple has changed the feature since it debuted on the iPhone 14 Pro in 2022.

Apple typically upgrades iPhones with faster and more efficient chip technology each year. While we are not expecting the iPhone 17 series to get TSMC's next-generation 2-nanometer chips, Apple's A19 chip technology is likely to be built on an upgraded 3-nanometer process. The iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to include an A19 Pro chip, while the iPhone 17 and the iPhone 17 Air could have the standard A19 chip. TSMC is working on its N3P process, with mass production set to begin in late 2024, so that's the chip technology that we're expecting Apple will use for the iPhone 17 lineup. Compared to earlier versions of 3nm chips, the N3P chips offer increased performance efficiency and increased transistor density.",MacRumors,https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/12-reasons-wait-for-iphone-17/,2024-12-06,
Was ist iOS? Das Betriebssystem von Apple erklärt,"* iOS ist das mobile Betriebssystem von Apple, das auf allen iPhones läuft.

* Auf iOS basieren außerdem die Betriebssysteme für iPad, Apple Watch und Apple TV.

* Eine der Besonderheiten von iOS ist, dass alle kompatiblen iPhones von Apple die iOS-Updates gleichzeitig bekommen.

OS ist die Abkürzung des englischen Worts für Betriebssystem - Operating System. Genau das ist iOS: das Betriebssystem für die mobilen Geräte von Apple. Es handelt sich also um die Software, die dafür sorgt, dass Nutzer:innen ein Gerät verwenden können. iOS-Geräte sind demnach alle iPhones des Herstellers. Es läuft ausschließlich auf dem iPhone, nicht aber auf den Smartphones anderer Anbieter.

Das ist ein Unterschied zu Android, dem konkurrierenden mobilen Betriebssystem von Google: Dieses ist auf den Smartphones vieler Handyhersteller installiert, nicht nur auf den Google-Pixel-Smartphones. Auch Samsung, Sony oder Xiaomi verwenden Android als Grundlage für ihre Benutzeroberfläche.

"" Das iPhone 16 mit Vertrag bestellen ""

Apples iOS ist aber nicht nur auf dem iPhone zu finden. Auf dem Betriebssystem basieren außerdem iPadOS für das iPad, watchOS für die Apple Watch sowie seit Version 4 die Software für Apple TV. Ein weiteres Gerät mit iOS war der Musikplayer iPod Touch, dessen Produktion Apple im Jahr 2022 eingestellt hat.

Jedes Jahr im Herbst bringt Apple in der Regel eine neue iPhone-Generation heraus. Diese Modelle sind jeweils die Ersten, die auch mit einer neuen Version des Betriebssystems ausgerüstet sind. iOS erhält damit zusätzliche Funktionen, zudem werden wichtige Bugfixes bereitgestellt.

"" Das iPhone 16 Pro Max mit Vertrag bestellen ""

Mit den Modellen der iPhone-16-Reihe erschien im September 2024 zum Beispiel iOS 18. Danach folgten mehrere kleinere Aktualisierungen, die zusätzliche Features boten oder Sicherheitslücken stopften. So gibt es seit November 2024 bereits iOS 18.1.1.

Aber nicht nur die neuen iPhones bekommen das neue iOS, sondern auch ältere Modelle. Im Fall von iOS 18 sind das alle iPhones, die maximal fünf Jahre alt sind. Das Update auf iOS 18 haben also das iPhone Xr, Xs (Max) und jünger erhalten.

Das Apple-Betriebssystem zeichnet sich durch einige besondere Merkmale aus:

* Optimierung auf Apple-Geräte: Weil Betriebssystem und Geräte aus einer Hand stammen, kann Apple diese bestmöglich aufeinander abstimmen.

* Benutzerfreundliche und intuitive Oberfläche: iOS ist so gestaltet, dass es leicht zu bedienen ist - auch wenn jemand technisch weniger versiert ist.

* Nahtlose Integration ins Apple-Ökosystem: Mobile Geräte mit dem Betriebssystem können problemlos mit anderen Geräten des Herstellers zusammenarbeiten und Daten austauschen, etwa mit Apple Watch, Mac oder Apple TV.

* App Store: Im App Store für das iPhone finden Anwender:innen unzählige Apps, die speziell für iOS entwickelt und daran angepasst wurden.

* Sicherheit und Datenschutz: Das Betriebssystem bietet Schutzmaßnahmen auf Hard- und Softwareebene, um es vor Angriffen zu schützen. iOS-Apps laufen in einer abgeschotteten Sandbox. Dort finden sich nur vertrauenswürdige Apps, die vor Veröffentlichung streng geprüft wurden.

* Updates: Die Updates für iOS bekommen alle kompatiblen iPhones gleichzeitig. Bei Android hängt es vom jeweiligen Handyhersteller ab, wann welches Gerät aktualisiert wird.

* Weniger Freiheit: Nutzer:innen von Android-Handys haben mehr Möglichkeiten. Sie können etwa die Benutzeroberfläche stärker personalisieren. iOS-User sind dagegen eingeschränkter.

iOS 19: Was wir zu schon zu Release und Features wissen

In der Abkürzung iOS steckt die Bezeichnung für das, was es ist - ein OS, also ein Betriebssystem. An dem Buchstaben i erkennst Du, dass es sich um ein Produkt von Apple handelt, genau wie bei iPhone, iPad, iMac oder iPod. Ursprünglich hieß iOS aber etwas anderes: Das Wort stand für ""iPhone Operating System"".

"" Das iPhone 16 Pro im Vodafone-Shop bestellen ""

Im Jahr 2005 hat Apple unter der Führung von Steve Jobs mit der Entwicklung von iOS und dem ersten iPhone begonnen. Zusammen mit dem ersten iPhone-Modell ist es schließlich 2007 herausgekommen. Auch die aktuellen iPhones des Herstellers - iPhone 16, 16 Plus, 16 Pro und 16 Pro Max - verwenden das System, allerdings in einer neuen Version.

Bis 2010 sprach Apple selbst vom iPhone OS. Weil aber das im selben Jahr veröffentlichte iPad das gleiche System verwendete, wurde der Name abgekürzt. 2019 brachte Apple dann erstmals ein eigenständiges iPadOS heraus, das seitdem auf allen Tablets des Herstellers läuft.

Als das erste iPhone mit iOS 2007 herauskam, war das Betriebssystem einzigartig. Doch Google zog mit Android nach: Das erste Handy mit diesem Betriebssystem erschien 2008. Drei Jahre später hatte das Google-System den weltweit größeren Marktanteil, und so ist es bis heute geblieben.

Laut Statista teilen Apple und Google den Markt der mobilen Betriebssysteme unter sich auf, andere Anbieter spielen keine Rolle mehr. Mehr als zwei Drittel der mobilen Geräte in Deutschland laufen mit Android-Betriebssystem, ein Drittel sind iPhones, berichtet Statista.

iOS 18.1 und iOS 18.1.1: Release und Neuerungen im Überblick

Weltweit bewegen sich die Marktanteile des iPhones und damit des Apple-Betriebssystems zwischen 12 und 20 Prozent, meldet Statista weiter. Nur in einigen Ländern ist es anders, etwa in den USA oder in Großbritannien, wo der Anteil bei 40 Prozent liegt.

iOS 18.2 -- All the new AI features and changes explained,"The release candidate version of iOS 18.2 has arrived, as Apple gears up for the software's full public rollout. Here's everything you need to know about the update and its features.

On Thursday, two weeks after the fourth developer beta, Apple deployed the release candidate build of iOS 18.2. While the update can be installed on devices as old as the iPhone XR and iPhone XS, the software includes a variety of features that only work on iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and the iPhone 16 range.

Apple Intelligence makes it possible to use generative AI software for things such as text editing, proofreading, summarization, as well as tone adjustment, among other things. These features are available system-wide through a dedicated Writing Tools framework on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, with iOS 18.2 bringing even more AI-powered functionality to the table.

The software expands upon the existing capabilities of Writing Tools, originally introduced with iOS 18.1. The iOS 18.2 update offers many new Apple Intelligence features related to image generation, as well as a variety of other improvements.

Starting with iOS 18.2, Siri can forward questions and requests to ChatGPT. OpenAI's software also powers a new text composition feature in Writing Tools. This means that users can ask ChatGPT to generate text or answer questions directly from iOS, rather than using a third-party app or website.

ChatGPT integration was introduced with user privacy in mind, as all requests are sent anonymously. A ChatGPT account is not required for the use of basic features, which are freely available to users at any time.

Advanced ChatGPT capabilities, however, are available only in a limited capacity. As part of the iOS 18.2 update, users will be able to see whether or not they've exceeded the daily limit for ChatGPT's advanced capabilities.

Once the advanced capability limit has been passed, additional requests are sent to the basic version of ChatGPT for up to 24 hours. Those who want even more now have the option to upgrade to ChatGPT Plus for $19.99 a month straight from the Settings app. Siri has gained the ability to fetch real-time information with ChatGPT Plus, and the virtual assistant can share screenshots with ChatGPT as well.

It's worth pointing out that ChatGPT integration is only available for devices that already support Apple Intelligence, such as the iPhone 16 range. With the iOS 18.2 update, Apple has also included new settings specific to these devices.

iOS 18.2 introduces various settings for the Camera Control, which made its debut with the iPhone 16 range. The Camera Control is an entirely new hardware component, a button with a capacitive surface and a force sensor. The button can be used in conjunction with Apple Intelligence through an entirely new feature known as Visual Intelligence.

With Visual Intelligence, users can click and hold the Camera Control button while aiming their iPhone 16 at an object or location of interest. This will, in turn, provide users with useful information via Apple's generative AI software.

For instance, users can point their devices towards a restaurant and receive details about the location's ratings or working hours. In the same way, it's also possible to add a calendar event from a flyer or identify a dog by breed.

There are also new settings related to the Camera Control and its functions in iOS 18.2. Users can now adjust the double-click speed for Camera Control. Apart from the Default option, the double-click speed can be set to Slow or Slower.

The software update adds a new AE/AF Lock option as well, which locks the exposure and focus when taking a photo. The Camera Control can be configured to toggle AE/AF Lock with a light press. This means that the exposure stays consistent and that the image won't darken, even when the iPhone is moved around.

Apple has added a new customization option that lets you open the Camera app even if your screen is off. Located in Settings > Display and Brightness, there's now an option titled Require Screen On, which is enabled by default. Disabling this option lets you activate the Camera app via Camera Control even if the device's display is currently off.

iOS 18.2 introduces Image Playground, which is an entirely new system application that lets users create images through artificial intelligence.

In the Image Playground app, users can write a description of the image they want to see and have generative AI create it. This can be an image of a person they know, a landscape, an object, or anything in between. The software does have guardrails in place, though, so it's not able to create images of copyrighted characters or inappropriate content.

Images can be created in one of two styles: animation and illustration. The content created within Image Playground is not hyper-realistic by any means. Apple has also made sure that all images generated with the app are labeled as such so that they could never be mistaken for real-world photographs.

Image Playground allows you to generate images with a resolution of 1024 by 1024. They are saved locally and can be shared like any other photo on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. A similar feature, known as Image Wand, lets users create images based on text found within the Notes app. Typed or handwritten text can be turned into an image through artificial intelligence.

Image Playground features integration with system applications such as Freeform, Keynote, Messages, and Pages, as well as with third-party apps. With it, users can create so-called Genmojis along with other types of images.

With iOS 18.2, users can create unique emojis straight from the iOS keyboard. These custom emoticons are known as Genmoji and can be synced via iCloud, appearing in the user's sticker drawer across all compatible devices.

Users can simply describe the emoji they want to create, such as one based on an object or a person they know, and Apple Intelligence will make it a reality. Genmoji can be created with source images from the Photos app, or a generic emoji person can be used instead.

Genmoji don't necessarily need to be people, though, as they can consist of various objects, both real and imaginary -- it's all up to the end user's creativity.

The Mail app has received a significant update with iOS 18.2, as Apple's built-in email application can now sort emails into pre-defined categories. Email categorization was one of the key improvements previewed at WWDC 2024, and it's now finally here.

Through machine learning, the built-in Mail app can classify emails into categories such as:

The Mail app now features an entirely new Digest view, which can display all emails from a specific company, making interactions with these messages significantly easier.

With the Digest view, users will be able to get information about flights from a particular company, for instance. Users will also be able to adjust the email category in which senders appear. There's also a new option for app badges, letting users choose whether they appear only for primary unread messages or all unread messages.

While Apple Intelligence and its associated features are undoubtedly a major component of the iOS 18.2 update, the software also contains a variety of improvements that have nothing to do with AI. Specifically, iOS 18.2 contains new features for FindMy, Photos, and much more.

FindMy has received a significant update with iOS 18.2, as the software now lets users share the location of lost items with people they trust.

When an AirTag or other item is lost, users can opt to share the location of the item with a trusted individual or even an airline, all so that the lost item can be more easily recovered. This could be particularly useful for lost luggage, though FindMy-equipped devices have also helped authorities locate stolen vehicles in some instances.

The lost item's location is shared in the form of a link. The link recipient will be able to see the AirTag's location, serial number, and the user's Apple Account email or phone number for a limited amount of time. Location sharing is automatically stopped once the item is found, or when the link to the item's location expires.

iOS 18.2 also expands the availability of Hearing Health features for the AirPods Pro 2 wireless earbuds. Specifically, the Hearing Test feature is now available in Cyprus, Czechia, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Romania, Spain, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom. The clinical-grade Hearing Aid feature, meanwhile, was made available in the United Arab Emirates.

Hearing Health features were originally introduced with the iOS 18.1 update in the United States, following FDA approval in September 2024. On AirPods Pro 2, these features let users test their hearing or use the device as a hearing aid in cases of mild to moderate hearing loss.

It's worth noting, though, that the AirPods Pro 2 need to be running firmware 7B19 or newer for any of these features to function. The features are not meant to work in countries or regions where they have not yet been approved.

The operating system also introduces a minor change to video playback in the Photos application. Videos are no longer automatically zoomed in as soon as playback begins. Users also have the option to scrub through a video frame-by-frame and can disable the auto-looping of video playback.

On the iPad side of things, iPadOS 18.2 introduces a noteworthy change to the Apple TV application. The in-app tab bar has been made customizable, and now items from the sidebar can be added to it.

Certain system applications and features have also received minor updates:

While there are some improvements of note in this list, the great majority of them build upon existing applications and their features. The software also contains a few minor bug fixes, as detailed in Apple's release notes.

visionOS 2.2, on the other hand, includes a major improvement to the Mac Virtual Display feature. While the Apple Vision Pro was always usable as an external display for Mac, there are now two new display modes: Ultrawide and Wide. According to Apple, the new Ultrawide setting is the equivalent of connecting two 4K monitors to a Mac and using them side-by-side.

Apple also made it possible to view multiple sports games at once on the Apple Vision Pro. With visionOS 2.2, users can now view up to 5 MLB or MLS games simultaneously through their Apple TV+ subscription. While it's not currently possible to view other sports, Apple has added SharePlay integration with visionOS 2.2, letting users of the headset watch games together.

On the Apple Watch, watchOS 11.2 introduces a new pause button for the Camera Remote application. This means that it's now possible to pause videos being recorded on an iPhone via the Camera Remote app on an Apple Watch, through a new button located on the left side of the screen.

The Apple Vision Pro and Apple Watch platforms still lack Apple Intelligence, though, meaning that their users won't be able to take advantage of the various AI features available on other Apple platforms.

Although some Apple Intelligence features are already here, such as email summarization and the Clean Up tool in Photos, a good chunk of them are still only available in the release candidate build. iOS 18.2 is expected to receive its final public release in early December 2024, which is when features like Image Playground and Visual Intelligence will become available to all users.",AppleInsider,https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/12/05/ios-182-is-nearing-its-public-release-and-its-packed-with-ai-features,2024-12-05,
7 Best iPhone Data Recovery Software of 2024,"Read our disclosure page to find out how can you help Windows Report sustain the editorial team. Read more

Although you can use native iPhone recovery methods like iCloud, sometimes it just isn't enough. I tested many iPhone data recovery software solutions and narrowed down 7 of the best.

These are useful when regular iCloud or iTunes backups fail. It is especially true following virus attacks, accidental deletion, hardware damage, iOS update corruption, and other problems.

Using iPhone data recovery software can help you retrieve lost or deleted data, minimizing the impact of unexpected issues.

So, let's dive in...

I ranked the following 1-7 based on features, compatibility, ease of use, and pricing:

As a Windows user with an iPhone, my current go-to recovery software is Stellar iPhone Recovery. Of course, it's also compatible with Mac.

Depending on your device's condition, the powerful tool is able to recover the full range of data. This encompasses your app library, contacts, call history, text messages, photos, videos, documents, Notes, Voice Memos, Safari data, and more.

You can even rescue media from third-party apps like WhatsApp, Photo Stream, Viber, Tango; you name it. If it was on your device, you have a strong chance of getting it back.

While I focused on iPhone, you'll be pleased to know Stellar also recovers iPad (Air, Mini, Pro) and iPod Touch data. It supports iOS 18 through 12 and earlier, so data is still recoverable whether you have the latest Series or an older device.

It doesn't matter if you accidentally deleted something, are experiencing iOS update issues, or factory reset the phone. Stellar uses your computer to comb through the storage to find the data iOS won't display on the handset.

What's more, it can pull deleted data from iCloud and iTunes. I like that it offers a full restore from backup and the ability to choose exactly what you want.

Moreover, even if the iTunes backup is encrypted, Stellar gets the job done.

Simply launch the software, choose iPhone, iTunes, or iCloud, and check what data to look for. Scanning is some of the fastest I've tested, and you get to preview the contents before proceeding.

Unlike other tools, you have the option of a fast or deep scan. The latter recognizes file signatures even if the data is corrupted. E.g., I got some photos back without the filenames or metadata, that may have ordinarily been missed.

It also offers a full toolkit version, i.e., Stellar Toolkit for iPhone that comes with a permanent data eraser and the ability to remove your Apple ID, even if you've forgotten the password.

Furthermore, you can repair iOS problems, such as crashes, reboot loops, black screen, and white screen. It recovers the OS while still maintaining the data.

Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone is one of the few that offers free functionality, allowing you to connect your iPhone, Scan data for recovery and Preview the recovered data.

It's also one of the most affordable, starting at just $39.99 for 5 devices or $49.99 for the Toolkit which have additional functionalities like repair iPhone iOS, remove Apple ID, iPhone data eraser along with the iPhone data recovery.

The Data Recovery software from Disk Drill is another powerful solution for retrieving lost or deleted data. It covers iPhones, iPads, and iPod Touch devices, and is compatible with Windows and Mac.

Disk Drill can scan your iPhone's internal memory and recover data directly from the device.

Moreover, it extracts and recovers data from iTunes and iCloud backups without having to erase the existing data on your device.

If you don't have an iTunes backup, it can restore your files by bypassing the iOS restrictions and creating one itself.

For iCloud, it can even recover files that have been permanently deleted after the 30-day recovery period.

I particularly like that it offers Recovery Vault and Guaranteed Recovery, which helps safeguard your data against future loss.

Disk Drill iPhone Data Recovery is visually appealing with a simple interface. You can preview files before recovery and pick and choose specific files to recover.

This includes call, chat, and text history, as well as photos, videos, contacts, app data, notes, and Voice Memos. It also restores media from other common apps like WhatsApp.

The free version only lets you preview what can be recovered. To actually recover iPhone data, you'll need the $89 lifetime license, with an added $19 for lifetime upgrades. This supports one user and three devices.

Aiseesoft's FoneLab is a solid choice for iPhone data recovery, as well as iPad and iPod Touch devices.

It's capable of rescuing a comprehensive range of data. This includes photos, messages, contacts, music, videos, and even WhatsApp, LINE, and Kik attachments.

FoneLab offers three modes, digging deep into your device's memory, iTunes backup, or iCloud backup. Plus, it runs on Windows and Mac.

I like its clean interface, with clearly labeled data types and large preview icons.

Moreover, it covers practically all iOS versions including iPhone 16, iOS 18 and countless earlier versions.

It also provides several extra features, such as iOS system recovery. I.e. when you're experiencing system errors. It doubles as its own iPhone backup and restore tool. Then it offers its own dedicated WhatsApp transfer feature that transfers, backs up and restores WhatsApp data and attachments between devices.

FoneLab follows a familiar scan and preview process, which went smoothly for me. The free version is limited to previewing found data, while the paid version unlocks everything for $69.95.

If I have one complaint, my missing notes weren't restored to the Notes apps. Instead, I got a HTML document, but it's not the end of the world.

Another comprehensive data recovery tool is iMobie PhoneRescue. This powerful software not only recovers data directly from your iOS device, but also allows you to restore files from iTunes or iCloud backups.

Plus, it comes with handy tools like iOS system recovery and hidden data recovery, making it a versatile solution for any data disaster.

What's more, PhoneRescue supports both Windows and Mac operating systems, and can handle a wide range of file types. This includes text messages, media files, contacts, notes, app data, messaging attachments, and more.

PhoneRescue takes just a few steps to recover data and has a good visual interface with previews.

First it scans for recoverable data and then thoroughly analyzes it. I found it slower than the likes of Stellar, but it still gets the job done.

Again, while you can preview what can be rescued for free, you'll need to pay to actually recover it.

With support for more than 30 file types, FonePaw's iPhone data recovery software is certainly worth considering.

The Windows and Mac tool can bring your data back from current and old iOS devices. Plus, it supports iTunes and iCloud, with the ability to choose precisely what data you want.

I was able to salvage everything from audio files and Safari history to Voice Memos and Notes. It also supports third-party app data like WhatsApp, Kik, Line, Viber, Messenger, and Wechat messages and attachments.

The simple 3-step process involves selecting the recovery mode, waiting for the scan, and previewing the data before recovery.

In terms of speed, it falls somewhere in the middle. Not as fast as the top picks but not as slow as PhoneRescue.

Comparatively, its lifetime license is an affordable $66.47, which supports six devices and one PC. You can also opt for a one-month $49.95 plan. All plans come with upgrades and technical support.

It follows the preview before you buy model, so you can see what can be recovered before purchasing.

Wondershare offers a lot of tools for iOS and other devices, but for iPhone you want the Dr.Fone Data Recovery iOS version. This also supports iPad and iPod touch.

Its perpetual license is $79.95 and covers up to 5 mobile devices from one PC or Mac, with a 7-day money back guarantee.

Like FonePaw, it supports over 30 file types, which is essentially everything. You can also selectively choose what to restore.

Likewise, it can access your iPhone directly or draw from iCloud and iTunes backups.

Dr.Fone has one of the more visually appealing interfaces, boasting large previews with associated info.

It stands out thanks to extra features like iOS repair, remote screen unlock, and phone-to-phone transfer. Though if you don't need these, cheaper options are available.

One of the most affordable options comes from iMyFone's D-Back for iOS. This Windows and Mac software is just $49.99 for the full version, while you can scan and preview missing iPhone data for free.

It supports iOS going back to iOS 9, as well as iPod Touch 1-7, and the full range of iPads.

Although it has a modern interface and supports device, iTunes, and iCloud recovery modes, it can only recover about 20 types of data. This includes the most important files, app, and phone data, but lacks the depth of my top picks.

Nonetheless, it's fast and easy-to-use, with a good preview feature and selective recovery. Simply scan, select, and recover.

Its standout feature is AI recovery. This can help piece back together corrupt images and videos that would usually not be recoverable.

I also found success when the iPhone is unresponsive, as long as the computer can still recognize it. Moreover, it can still find device data if it hasn't been overwritten or still resides in the 30-day window.

The iPhone data recovery software you choose will depend on your needs. However, to make my rankings, I personally considered the following:

Compatibility - Not everyone with an iPhone uses Mac, so it's important the software also works on Windows. Moreover, not everyone uses the latest iPhone and iOS, so I picked software with good backwards compatibility. In many cases, you can recover data from iPads and iPods too. Some even support Android, though this wasn't my focus.

Number of Devices - Most iPhone recovery tools require a computer, but what if you have multiple mobile devices to recover? I chose software that supports more than one device, while some even serve unlimited phones.

Extra Features - I consider extra features to be a bonus, but many are useful. From data protection to stop data loss in the future to AI image and video recovery, a lot of software is starting to expand its functionality.

Ease of Use - If you can't scan and recover in a few steps, then it's best to avoid the software. Look for visual previews of recoverable data, and remember, it shouldn't take forever for the process to complete.

Pricing - I picked software with pricing plans to suit all budgets. To make the rankings, the tool must at least let you preview its recovery options, so you're confident it will work for you. Anything over $100 is not worth the price, as I found the best solutions rarely exceed this. A good tip is to weigh the pros and cons of a one-off lifetime license vs a cheaper monthly plan that you can cancel. It all depends on how likely you think you'll need the software.

Successfully recovering data from your iPhone depends on the underlying problem. However, following these tips give you a better chance of the process going smoothly:

As my top pick, here's a quick summary of how to get started with Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone.

4. Choose from Recover from iPhone, iTunes Backup, or iCloud Backup. Then check or uncheck the type of data you wish to recover.

5. For device recovery, click Next, check the right device is connected and click Scan.

6. Once complete, you will see a tree structure on the left of all the categories of recovered data, which you can expand and collapse. Previews of the data are shown in the main window.

When you can't get back your iPhone data, data recovery software is here to help. Based on its intuitive interface, deep recovery capabilities, and affordable pricing, Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone is my top choice. Its Toolkit of extra features is a great bonus.

Nonetheless, all the other picks do the job well too. Which do you prefer? Let me know in the comments below!",Windows Report | Error-free Tech Life,https://windowsreport.com/best-iphone-data-recovery-software/,2024-12-05,
New to iPhone? Here Are All of Apple's First-Party Apps and What They Do,"If you're switching from Android to iPhone, you probably already know that things can be a bit different.

Even though the interface is now pretty similar, some differences might be challenging to adjust to. One of the most significant differences is Apple's iPhone apps in its App Store.

Apple offers a bunch of first-party apps that try to make your iPhone experience easy and simple. While they do a good job at it, Apple doesn't really tell you which first-party apps are available from the start.

When you set up your iPhone, you'll get essential apps like Reminders and Calendar, but what about the others?

At the time of this writing, Apple has over 40 iPhone apps -- also available for the iPad -- that you can download for free. Some of them are self-explanatory, while others might confuse even seasoned iPhone users.

But if you want to master your iPhone and make the most of all the apps Apple offers, here's a breakdown of every first-party iPhone app and its capabilities.

Following this link will take you to Apple's developer page on the App Store, where you'll find almost all iPhone apps available. You can download as many apps as you like and experience them yourself or read the brief descriptions of what these apps offer.

This is one of Apple's newest additions coming in iOS 18.2 this month -- and one of the first Apple Intelligence apps you can use on selected iPhones. This app lets you create illustrations, sketches, or animations based on the prompts you give it. For instance, you can ask for a birthday cake, and Image Playground will provide you with precisely that in different art styles.

It's worth noting that this app is only available for the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 models.

This is another new app from Apple that lets you store and manage your passwords on any Apple device. You can store your passwords, Wi-Fi passwords, and verification codes. There's also a Windows app available as part of Apple's iCloud for Windows tools.

This is a music streaming app focused on classical music. It has the largest classical music catalog, and all songs are available in the highest audio quality Apple Music has to offer. If you're an Apple Music, you can use this app for no extra cost.

This is a productivity app that lets you work with other people remotely. It's a whiteboard you can use to sketch a project and share it with others in real time. People can see what you're creating, and they can even collaborate and make changes on their own. Of course, you can also use it by yourself if you want to work on a solo project.

This is an app that most of us won't ever need. It lets studios and recording houses review their videos before uploading them to the Apple TV app.

This is another niche app that lets you manage all the apps that you might use in your company. It can also let you manage devices that are part of an Apple Business Essentials subscription.

This is Apple's one-stop shop for all health-related things. With this app, you can track your sleep, weight, medications, and much more. You can then share that data with other apps that need it. An Apple Watch can also help you track your heart rate automatically.

This one is pretty self-explanatory. It's Apple's camera app, which is preinstalled on your iPhone by default and can't be removed (unless you're in the European Union).

Another pretty self-explanatory app is the clock app. It lets you manage the time for different time zones simultaneously, set timers or a stopwatch, and create alarm clocks.

This is Apple's messages app. You can use it to talk with Android users via regular text messages or with other iPhone users through iMessage, Apple's instant messaging service.

This app will automatically store all the pictures you take and all the images you download or receive from instant messaging apps. It will also create memories with previous pictures you took and automatically make movies to remember previous events or vacations.

This is Apple's browser app and one of the best options for the iPhone. It lets you create different profiles to keep your personal stuff and work-related browsing separate, and it also lets you add extensions as if you were on a desktop.

This is an accessibility app that lets you turn your iPhone's camera into a magnifying glass, allowing you to see things more clearly.

As you can guess by its name, this app lets you experience the world of Apple's For All Mankind original series from Apple TV+, by looking at objects from the past. It's a little game that uses your iPhone's augmented reality capabilities and gives you the whole story about the objects from the story.

This is one of the most valuable apps if you have other Apple devices. It will let you keep track of all your Apple devices' locations and help you delete them remotely in case they go missing. You can also track other third-party devices in the Find My network.

The name says it all; this is a translation app that lets you translate almost any language into English -- and vice versa. You can type words to get a translation or use the camera to translate a picture or image on the go. And you can also use it to hear the pronunciation of other languages so the other person understands what you're trying to say a little bit better.

This app maximizes Augmented reality, allowing you to modify or create objects virtually. You can also create 3D models and see what they look like in your physical space. Of course, you'll need an iPhone Pro with LiDAR to make this work, which is available on the iPhone 12 Pro and later models.

This was one of Apple's first video games, and it's been around for over a decade. It's a Texas Hold'em game you can play with 24 other in-game players or friends online.

The Shortcuts app lets you create or download shortcuts that perform specific actions. For instance, you can create a shortcut to open a particular app when you arrive at work or home or use a shortcut to set a Focus mode after a specific time. The possibilities are endless, and you can download thousands of useful iPhone shortcuts right now.

You've probably heard of Shazam before, but now it's part of Apple's first-party apps. You can use it to find the name of a song, discover more artists, or watch music videos. You can link your Apple Music or Spotify account and update a Shazam playlist with the new songs you find.

This remote is for the Apple Music, iTunes, or Apple TV apps. With it, you can connect your iPhone to your Mac or PC and control your music remotely. You can access all your libraries or search for more songs on your iPhone. When you choose a song or playlist, your Mac or PC will start playing it.

This unique and interesting app lets you measure real-life objects with your iPhone. The app is incredibly accurate, but you need an iPhone with a LiDAR sensor -- an iPhone 12 Pro or a later Pro model -- to use it.

This app is for developers, so most of us won't find it helpful. It lets you manage the apps you've uploaded to the App Store. You can manage your App Stores submissions, view statuses, and check your app's performance and sales.

This is Apple's file management app. It contains all the files you've stored or downloaded to your iPhone. You can use it to make some basic edits to specific files, and it will automatically sync with all your other Apple devices.

If you have an Apple Watch, this app will keep track of your workouts, the calories you've burned, and the medals you've earned by closing your rings. You'll also find Apple Fitness+, a subscription service with different workouts you can do at home.

This is a simple app that lets you make quick videos and edit them for sharing on social media or with your friends and family. You can add your stickers or favorite emojis or text and other filters.

This app will help you find troubleshooting tips for your iPhone or other Apple devices. If you can't fix the issue, you can make a reservation with an authorized service provider so a professional can examine your iPhone.

This app has a vast library of TV shows and movies you can rent or buy with a few taps. You can also watch live sports events that you've paid for before.

Of course, this is where you'll also find Apple TV+, Apple's streaming service filled with exclusive movies and TV shows. You can also add other streaming services like Max or Prime Video to see your watchlist in one place.

As you can guess by its name, this is Apple's news app. It offers news from your local area and all over the world. It has a dedicated section for sports news and even word games that are updated daily. While most of the news articles can be read for free, you'll need to subscribe to a monthly or yearly plan to read some paid news sources like the Wall Street Journal and access more advanced features like puzzles and audio news.

This app lets you control all your smart home devices in one place. You can, for instance, control your lights, security cameras, or climate. You can also create schedules so you know your home will always be locked and the lights will be turned off after a specific time.

This navigation app will guide you wherever you need to go. You can download maps so you don't get lost, even if you don't have service, and you can even find cool new places you've never heard of.

Granted, this is an app that you probably don't need. With it, you can search for over 100 million songs you can buy. It used to have movies and shows, but Apple moved them to the TV app. It's best to ignore this app and use Apple Music and TV instead.

This is Apple's default mail app. It lets you add any type of email address, making it easier to manage all your accounts in one place. With Apple Intelligence, available for the iPhone 16 and iPhone 15 Pro models, Apple will add different tools, like a sorting feature, smart notifications, and writing tools so that you can sound more professional with your coworkers.

This one is pretty self-explanatory. You can check the calendar, find upcoming holidays in your country, or create events you don't want to forget about. It also syncs all your reminders, making it easier to find everything you need to do during the day.

This app lets you find, create, or manage contacts on your iPhone. Your contacts will be synced in the cloud, so you'll be able to find them on your other Apple devices.

This is Apple's popular video-calling app. With a few taps, you can call other Apple devices or send a link so Android and Windows users can join the calls.

This is an app you probably won't need. It lets you see all the TV shows, movies, and videos you bought on the iTunes Store. You can also play them from this app, and with iCloud, you can pick up where you left off. Realistically, it's best to stick to Apple TV if you plan to manage the TV shows and movies you've bought.

This is Apple's music streaming service. Although it's available for Android and iPhone, it works way better on Apple devices. Consider it an alternative to Spotify.

Apple Music does have some benefits compared to Spotify. For example, it has higher-quality audio and allows you to access Apple Music Classical. The downside is that it doesn't have a free version. You'll need to subscribe to the service to try it.

As you can guess by the name, this app lets you access thousands of podcasts for free. You can follow the podcasts you like, download any episode you want, and get notifications when your favorite creators add more content.

This app lets you store your credit or debit cards, tickets, and boarding passes. You can even add your driver's license if you're in the right state. Apple Wallet also comes with other features, like applying for an Apple credit card or opening a high-yield savings account. You can even transfer money to other iPhones if you have iOS 18 on your iPhone.

This app lets you control specific settings from the Apple Watch. You can pair a new Apple Watch, change its face, or customize its settings.

This is Apple's note-taking app, and it's one of the best out there. With it, you can write notes and create checklists, all of which can be synced with other Apple devices. Moreover, if you have iOS 18, you can use the Notes app to record and transcribe your notes, record phone calls, and even solve math problems and equations automatically.

This first-party reminder app lets you create and manage all your reminders in one place. You can also create a grocery list that automatically sorts all your items into different categories, making them easier to find.

This one is pretty straightforward. It's a weather app that lets you monitor the weather in any location. In addition to the temperature and chances of rain, you get a forecast for the rest of the week, along with information about the air's quality, the wind's speed, and much more.

As we've mentioned during this article, much of the content you store in your iPhone will sync in the cloud so you can access it on other Apple devices. With the iCloud Drive app, you can open your iCloud account and see every type of document or file you've uploaded to the cloud. However, this has mostly been replaced by the Files app, so you won't need this unless you're using an older iPhone model.

This simple app lets you record sounds with just a tap. The sounds are stored inside the app, where you can listen to or edit them if necessary.

This is the default app on your iPhone, and it's self-explanatory. It's a calculator app for all your basic calculations or tricky equations. With iOS 18, the Calculator app has some new features, like converting different units or quickly switching from the basic to the scientific calculator. You can also access your history to check the calculations you've done.

These are most of Apple's apps for the iPhone. All the apps on the list are free, so you can download them and use most of their features at no extra cost. Of course, some will need specific requirements, like a modern iPhone or an iPhone with a LiDAR sensor. Try out these apps and see which ones work better for you.",iDrop News,https://www.idropnews.com/apps/new-to-iphone-here-are-all-of-apples-first-party-apps-and-what-they-do/228404/,2024-12-05,
iOS 18.2 Will Bring More Than Just AI to Your iPhone Soon,"Apple software beta tester, ""Helps make our computers and phones work!"" - Zach's grandparents

Apple released the iOS 18.2 release candidate to developers and beta testers on Dec. 5. The RC arrives more than a month after Apple released iOS 18.1 to the general public. While iOS 18.1 brought a few new features and fixes to all iPhones, and a few Apple Intelligence features to others, the RC brings more AI features to some developers and beta testers. There are also a few new features and upgrades in the RC that aren't a part of Apple Intelligence, so everyone can access them.

Read more: An Expert's Guide to iOS 18

Since this is still a beta, I recommend downloading it on something other than your primary device. Because this isn't the final version of iOS 18.2, the update might be buggy and battery life may be short, so it's best to keep those troubles on a secondary device.

Note that the RC is not the final version of iOS 18.2, so there could be more features to land on your iPhone when iOS 18.2 is released. There's no word on when Apple will release iOS 18.2 to the public.

Here are some of the features that could land on your iPhone with iOS 18.2 soon. Just a reminder that only developers and beta testers who have an iPhone 15 Pro, Pro Max or the iPhone 16 lineup can access the AI features for now. If you have any other iPhone, you won't have access to those features.

The Find My app can be used to locate things like your AirPods and MacBook, and with the iOS 18.2 RC, Apple makes it easy for everyone to get help finding lost items. In the RC, if you go into Find My > Items and tap one of your items, you have two new options: Share Item Location and Show Contact Info.

If you enable Share Item Location, Find My will create a link that you can share with others so they can notify you if they find your lost or missing item. This could be especially helpful as we head into the holidays as more people are traveling and losing luggage at airports or leaving items behind. These links expire after one week, though, which may not be enough time to find them.

If you enable Show Contact Info, others can connect to lost items so they can find ways to contact you and bring your item back to you.

The Mail app on every iPhone also gets an upgrade in the iOS 18.2 RC. Apple announced in September that Mail would soon be able to sort emails to multiple categories to keep your important emails in one place and ads or promotions in another, like Gmail and Outlook do. The new layout keeps things mostly tidy, but Mail doesn't always get it right. For example, I found an email for digital tickets I previously ordered in the Promotions category rather than the Primary category.

You don't have to use the new layout if you don't want to. To change your Mail layout back, go into Mail, tap the three dots (...) in the top right corner and tap List View.

Apple previously removed the volume slider on the iPhone's lock screen. You could still use the volume buttons on the side of your iPhone, but it wasn't as precise as the slider. With the iOS 18.2 RC, though, you can add the slider back to your lock screen.

Go to Settings > Accessibility > Audio and Visual and tap the toggle next to Always Show Volume Control. Now, whether you're listening to a podcast or music from one of Apple's apps or a third-party app the volume slider will be present on your lock screen.

If you have kids who like to play games or watch videos on their iPhones and they set the music to full blast, that could damage their device's speakers -- not to mention it could be annoying to you. With the iOS 18.2 RC, you can set a maximum volume limit on your or your kid's iPhone.

To set a limit go to Settings > Sounds & Haptics > Volume Limit and tap the toggle next to Limit Maximum Volume. A scale will appear and you can select what you want the limit to be. Apple does note that this limit doesn't apply to things like phone calls, FaceTime calls, emergency calls or Find My sounds.

There are over 3,000 emoji you can use, but sometimes you can't find the one you really want. Genmoji is here to help. With the Apple Intelligence Genmoji feature, you can describe the emoji you're looking for and iPhones with Apple Intelligence will attempt to generate a new emoji based on your description.

To use Genmoji, go into a message and tap the emoji keyboard in the bottom left corner of your keyboard. Then, type the emoji you're looking for into the search bar. If there isn't an emoji that matches your description, tap Create New Emoji just below the search bar. Your iPhone will then show you a few examples of what it came up with based on your description. You can swipe through the emoji, and when you find a Genmoji you like, tap Add in the top right corner to permanently add that new emoji to your keyboard.

This is Apple's answer to Google Lens. Visual Intelligence is an Apple Intelligence feature that lets you point your camera at something, like a dog, and your iPhone will then use the photo to search online to help you identify it. The feature can also be used to detect phone numbers to create contacts, scan QR codes and translate languages.

You can also integrate this feature with ChatGPT to help you identify items, as well as to help you better understand what's on a page or screen. It's important to note that you don't need a ChatGPT account to use the integration.

This feature is also only available on the iPhone 16 lineup since it utilizes the series' new camera control side-button. If you have one of the new iPhones, long press the new side-button where the SIM card tray used to be to quickly pull up Visual Intelligence.

""The camera control provides instant, easy access to the camera with just a click. It allows you to adjust various camera features simply by sliding your finger,"" Apple said at its Glowtime event in September. ""Its convenient design ensures it's always within reach.""

This Apple Intelligence feature takes Genmoji one step further and lets you create whole images based on text prompts called Image Playground. This feature is a standalone app and it can also be found in Message by tapping the plus (+) button to the left of your text box.

Image Playground is filled with prompt suggestions, themes, places and more to get you started. You can enter multiple prompts to make the image more specific, but once I entered seven prompts a popup appeared telling me to use fewer. There's also an option to change the art style from the default cartoony 3D images to illustrations.

If you want to put yourself, friends and family or your pet into one of these images, you can. Tap the plus (+) sign in the bottom right corner and then tap either Choose Photo or Take Photo. You'll still have to choose or enter a prompt in addition to the photo.

The feature can create some simple images, and it can be unintentionally funny with how weird other images are. In one instance, I selected the prompts astronaut, artist and lighthouse. One of the results showed what I can only describe as a half-stronaut propped up on an easel surrounded by frames opposite another easel with a drawing of a lighthouse on it. Stellar work.

You can also draw a sketch in Notes, select your sketch and use it with Visual Playground. That way you can either clean up your sketch, or if you're not an artist -- like myself -- you can use the feature to flesh out your sketch.

Apple announced at WWDC in May that its virtual assistant Siri was soon entering a ""new era"" thanks to Apple Intelligence enhancements. With the iOS 18.2 RC, Apple is bringing most of those enhancements to some iPhones.

With Apple Intelligence, instead of seeing a logo pop up on your screen when you activate Siri, you'll see a glowing light around your screen. You can use Siri like you normally would, and you can also use ChatGPT for your queries.

I asked Siri to use ChatGPT to show me how to brew a cup of coffee, and it wrote out a seven-step process on how to make drip coffee in a standard brewer. The instructions were a little wonky, telling me to measure out my water and coffee grounds before grinding my coffee beans. There is a disclaimer at the bottom of these ChatGPT requests that reads, ""Check important info for mistakes.""

You can also copy what Siri and ChatGPT show you by tapping a button in the top right corner of the window that shows two pieces of paper. Then, you can paste this in a message or a note if you want -- but again, you should verify the details of your request.

If you have any phones from the iPhone 16 lineup, you have the Camera Control button. You have to press this twice to open your camera if your screen is asleep or inactive, but Apple introduced a new toggle in the iOS 18.2 RC so that you can press the Camera Control once to open your camera even if your screen is off.

To do this, go to Settings > Display & Brightness and tap the toggle next to Require Screen On to disable the feature. Now if you press the Camera Control while your screen is off, your iPhone will open your Camera without a second press. However, it could also lead to accidentally opening your camera more often.

Here are the full release notes for the iOS 18.2 RC.

Apple Intelligence (All iPhone 16 models, iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max)

Those are a few of the new features developers and public beta testers can try with the iOS 18.2 RC.

"iPad, iPad Air, iPad Pro buyer's guide: holidays 2024","Apple has updated most of its iPad lineup in 2024, with the iPad mini the latest. Here's how to choose the best tablet for your budget this holiday season.

Apple offers its iPads at a wide array of price points. The price range covers everyone from value-oriented consumers to those with heftier budgets and greater demands.

The iPad is no exception to this. There's the entry-level iPad if you want a cheap but usable tablet, to the iPad Pro at the highest end of the scale.

Following the 2023 iPad upgrade drought, Apple has been busy making changes across most of the iPad range. Changes were made earlier in 2024 to the iPad Air and iPad Pro, while the iPad mini upgrade was a late-in-year addition.

Even so, Apple has maintained the ability to practically offer an iPad at any price level that a customer could pay. It's still a potentially bewildering selection, but knowing how much you want to spend can make choosing your iPad a lot easier.

What follows is AppleInsider's analysis of the iPad landscape, and what you should consider buying at each price point.

Apple's entire range of prices for the iPad covers a lot of options. At the low end of the scale is the $349 iPad, the tenth-generation entry-level model with 64GB of storage.

At the other end of the scale, the most expensive option is the 13-inch iPad Pro, which can be equipped with 2TB of storage, Nano-texture glass, and cellular access. All this comes out at a hefty $2,599.

That means there's a difference of $2,250 between the cheapest iPad and the most expensive. You could buy six of the cheapest base iPad models for the same price as the most expensive, and still have $155 left over for cases and accessories.

For the purposes of our comparison, we are splitting the range into three segments: under $650, over $1,000, and the $650 to $100 range.

While base prices are an obvious point of comparison, there are options that can adjust what the specifications are, and the end cost to you. This is where the comparison between prices can get a bit complex.

For a start, Apple offers its iPads with two general connectivity options. The standard model has Wi-Fi, but you can upgrade to cellular connectivity for either $150 or $200.

This is an upgrade cost that is the equivalent of a storage increase in most cases, and it can be warranted. If you want to connect to the Internet wherever you are, with minimal use of other items, this is the way to go.

However, you could use tethering options, such as turning an iPhone into a hotspot, to handle the cellular connectivity side of things. This would save you money since you don't need two data plans, but you will depend on the battery of your iPhone a bit more.

A second and more obvious variance is storage capacity, as you can pay to have more. If you tend to store and carry around a lot of data, then a storage upgrade will be very useful.

However, as the jumps in storage increase, so does the price for that upgrade. When it comes to the iPad Pro, which can go up to 2TB of capacity, this can add $1,000 to the price versus the base cost with 256GB of storage.

While for Macs, AppleInsider would offer the use of external storage as an alternative to paying high storage upgrade charges, it's not practical advice here. The iPad is designed to be portable, and external storage will generally add undesirable extra items to carry around.

Instead, consider how much storage you truly need, whether you really need the extra capacity, and if you could take advantage of services such as iCloud for your data.

Size is also a factor nowadays, as the more screen you have to play with, the more you can potentially do. Larger screens are typically better for content creation, such as for artists to draw on, but there is obviously going to be a price difference between sizes.

To simplify matters, we consider the 11-inch and 13-inch models of iPad Air and iPad Pro as separate models, much like the Wi-Fi and cellular variants.

The last option is Nano-texture glass, a feature borrowed from the Pro Display XDR. It's a treatment that reduces glare on the screen, making it easier to see despite harsh environmental lighting.

This is only really a consideration for those who buy high-capacity iPad Pro models. Unless you're about to spend a serious amount of money on a tablet, Nano-texture isn't going to be a $100 concern.

The budget end of the range is fairly easy to understand. At the absolute lowest end, you've only got one choice: the base 10th-gen iPad with 64GB for $349.

At $499, you have your first real choice, as you could pick up the higher storage capacity 256GB iPad, the 64GB version with cellular, or the iPad mini with 128GB of storage. All are a fairly safe bet, but we'd suggest the iPad mini due to the upgraded chip for Apple Intelligence support.

At $599, you could pick up the 11-inch iPad Air with 128GB of storage and the M2 chip, or an iPad mini with 256GB of capacity. The iPad Air is probably the better option, but the iPad mini is always the best option if you need a smaller tablet to carry around.

At $649, the top end of this scale, the choice boils down to a 256GB Wi-Fi iPad, a 128GB iPad mini with Cellular, or the two $599 options. The iPad Air and iPad mini are probably your best choices, depending on if cellular and size matters to you.

The $650 to $1,000 section is one of the more complex elements of the range, due to there being multiple models coming in and out of viability.

Starting from where the last section left off, the next price point to consider is $699, when the 11-inch iPad Air gets its upgrade to 256GB of storage. A cellular iPad mini may be a better option here, but then again, screen space could be more valuable.

At $749, the 11-inch iPad Air gains its cellular 128GB capacity option, while the iPad mini with cellular gets to 256GB of storage. The 11-inch iPad Air with Cellular seems like the one to go for here, though again its dependent on size.

Reaching $799, we get to the highest-capacity non-cellular iPad mini at 512GB, but also the 13-inch iPad Air with 128GB of storage comes into play. Unless you need the 13-inch screen, going for the smaller screens with a higher capacity probably makes more sense.

At $849, the 11-inch iPad Air with cellular gets to 256GB of storage, which makes it the best purchase of the range. Again, if you ignore size concerns.

Rising up to $899, your choice consists of a 512GB 11-inch iPad Air, a 256GB cellular version and a $50 saving, or a 256GB 13-inch iPad Air. The 256GB iPad mini with cellular is still an option at $150 cheaper if size matters.

Though for $50 more, you could get a 512GB iPad mini with cellular, or the 128GB 13-inch iPad Air gets its own cellular option. The Air models are, again, probably where you should put your money.

At the top end of this particular scale, the iPad mini isn't really an option anymore. For $999, you could get pretty much anything offered at the $949 level, or you could get the 11-inch iPad Pro with 256GB of storage.

Unless you absolutely need the performance of the M4 chip, you could probably save money and get more capacity with any of the iPad Air models at this point.

But, getting an iPad Pro can be quite tempting here.

This region is largely dominated by the iPad Pro models. Even so, high-capacity cellular options of earlier versions are still a possibility depending on your needs.

At $1,049, you could have the cellular 11-inch iPad Air at 512GB, or the 13-inch iPad Air with Cellular at 256GB. You could save $50 and get the entry-level 11-inch iPad Pro, which may be better overall.

For $50 more at $1,099, there are the non-cellular 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Air models at 1TB and 512TB respectively. Unless you need masses of storage, you should consider either the cellular iPad Airs that are slightly cheaper, or get the base 11-inch iPad Pro.

When we reach $1,199, the cellular 11-inch iPad Pro becomes an option, complete with 256GB of storage. You could get the 512GB non-cellular version for the same money.

$1,249 brings the cellular 13-inch iPad Air to 512GB and the cellular 11-inch iPad Air to 1TB. Again, its screen size or capacity, but the iPad Pro line is still arguably the best route forward.

When the 13-inch iPad Air reaches its 1TB capacity option at $1,299, it has to compete against the above cheaper cellular options, as well as a new competitor. The 13-inch iPad Pro arrives at this point, albeit with 256GB of storage.

That 13-inch iPad Pro would be decent enough, but remember you could save $100 and get double the capacity with the 11-inch version. Or save $50 and get the 13-inch iPad Air with cellular and 512GB of storage.

At $1,449, the last iPad Air configuration becomes an option, with 1TB of storage in th 13-inch model. For just $50 more, you can get the 13-inch iPad Pro with cellular at 256GB, or a 13-inch iPad Pro with 512GB.

After this price point, there are only iPad Pro models available, meaning your only real concerns are screen size, capacity, and cellular. For the 1TB and 2TB models, you could pay an extra $100 to add Nano-texture glass, which improves image quality.

You reach the top end of the 11-inch iPad Pro by $1,999, or $2,099 if you spring for the Nano-texture glass, with 2TB of storage. At that level, you could get a cellular version with Nano-texture glass and 1TB of storage for $1,899, a 13-inch iPad Pro with 1TB and the glass for $1,999, or the 13-inch with cellular and 1TB for $2,099.

The scale continues until $2,299, when the 11-inch iPad Pro with cellular maxes its storage at 2TB and employs the Nano-texture glass. For the same money, the 13-inch iPad Pro is also at 2TB without the glass, and the 13-inch with cellular and the glass is $100 cheaper.

The 13-inch iPad Pro sans cellular exits the chat at $2,399, again with 2TB of capacity and the glass treatment. Again, its a $200 saving to get the cellular equivalent with 1TB and Nano-texture.

Eventually, at a nose bleed-inducing $2,599, the 13-inch iPad Pro with cellular reaches its top configuration of 2TB and the aforementioned glass.

Picking the best tablet is always going to be hard when you have a lot of variants available. With Apple's product lineup, that's certainly the case when you get to the middle of the range.

Going for higher performance options is usually a good idea, but you really should actually have a need for it. If the iPad's going to be your primary computing device, it does make sense to pay for upper-tier models.

For quite a lot of use cases, the basic iPad can handle most of the average user's everyday tasks.

Screen size is always going to be a factor, and you have three to choose from: the iPad mini, 11 inches, or 13 inches. We've found that larger tablet sizes tend to be more useful for productivity and content creation, so erring towards the 13-inch could be a good idea here.

Cellular is arguably the most disposable feature of the lot, since you could simply tether off an iPhone or a mobile hotspot if local Wi-Fi isn't available. The price difference could be enough to cover the cost of other feature upgrades.

Storage is the biggest price variant, and it's not a linear jump. The cost increase is negligible at the low end, but it can certainly add a lot to the price.

That said, you should ask yourself if you really need 2TB of storage in an iPad Pro. You could save $400 and have 1TB, which an entirely usable amount of storage, even for professional uses.

Considering what features to fall back on could help you when it comes to AppleCare+ and accessories. Often forgotten about when pricing out a new iPad, these extras add to the overall cost, but can be very handy.",AppleInsider,https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/12/03/ipad-ipad-air-ipad-pro-buyers-guide-which-ipad-to-buy-for-your-budget-this-holiday-season,2024-12-03,
Everything We Know About the iPhone SE 4,"Ever since the first model was released in early 2016, the iPhone SE has been a great device for its price. It basically offers the power of one of the latest iPhones in a simpler and more affordable form factor.

Granted, you usually have to make some compromises, especially in the camera and battery life departments. However, if you aren't a power user and like smaller iPhones, the iPhone SE has always been a great bang for your buck.

That said, it's been a few years since Apple upgraded its most affordable iPhone. However, if the rumors are true, the wait will be worth it.

According to many leaks, the fourth-generation iPhone SE will be a significant upgrade -- and it might be closer than you think. Here's what the current rumors say about the upcoming budget-friendly iPhone.

One of the biggest changes coming to the iPhone SE 4 will be its design. So far, we've gotten used to Apple using an old iPhone's design for the newer iPhone SE. For instance, the first iPhone SE had the body of an iPhone 5s, while the second and third generations used the body of an iPhone 8.

So, typically, we'd expect Apple to use the old design of an iPhone X or iPhone 11, but it seems the company will skip a few generations ahead for the new iPhone SE.

According to rumors, the new iPhone SE will have a design similar to that of the iPhone 14, which is a pretty huge upgrade.

Of course, that confirms what we've all been waiting for: the end of Touch ID. The new iPhone SE 4 would feature Face ID for the first time ever.

So, you should expect a larger display without a Home button. Instead, Apple will use a big notch like the iPhone 14 models.

It's also rumored that the iPhone will also feature a USB-C port. That's a given since Apple has to abide by EU regulations, but it's great news for iPhone SE fans.

Besides the new port and notch, there have been rumors that Apple might even ditch the Ring and Silent Switch on the iPhone SE and add an Action button, like with the newer iPhone models. However, that might sound like a stretch if it's truly based on the iPhone 14, and recent rumors say it may not happen, so we'll have to wait for the final product to see.

The camera department has always been lacking in the iPhone SE models, but with this new model, things might change.

Rumor has it that the new iPhone will still feature a single camera on the back, which is very likely as it's a way for Apple to cut costs. However, the back camera will be a 48-megapixel camera, the same one you can find on the iPhone 15. Granted, it might not take pictures as well as the iPhone 15, but it'll still be a high-quality camera and a massive upgrade compared to the current model.

The front-facing camera is also rumored to be the same as the one on the iPhone 15 models.

As we mentioned before, the display on the next-generation iPhone SE will be significantly larger. In fact, if the iPhone SE does look like the iPhone 14, we're expecting a 6.1-inch display. The current iPhone SE has a much smaller 4.7-inch display, so the upgrade will be significant.

Speaking of display, Apple will also likely improve the quality of the iPhone SE's display. The third-generation iPhone SE is the only phone Apple still sells with an LCD screen. That isn't necessarily bad, but it's far from the best. There have been several rumors that Apple will finally switch to an OLED display, the same technology used on the rest of its iPhone models since 2020.

The inside of the iPhone SE 4 will also have a massive upgrade, and for a good reason.

If the rumors are true, the upcoming iPhone SE 4 will feature an A18 chip, which makes sense since Apple likes to use the most recent mainstream iPhone's chip on each new budget-friendly iPhone SE.

Additionally, the RAM will also see a significant upgrade. The current iPhone SE has 4 GB of RAM, but Apple is said to increase this to 8 GB.

Of course, there's a reason for this spec bump, and it's called Apple Intelligence. It seems like Apple wants to add Apple Intelligence support for all its devices, and the A18 chip combined with the 8GB of RAM is the minimum requirement to support Apple Intelligence, which will be a great plus for iPhone SE users.

If you love reading rumors about the iPhone, you've probably heard that Apple will add its very own 5G chip on the iPhone SE 4 and the rumored ultra-thin iPhone 17.

The iPhone usually comes with an extra chip that supports the 5G technology, and Apple has been working on creating its own 5G model. The current generation of iPhones use a Qualcomm modem, but Apple is working on changing that.

According to popular Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple will use its new 5G chip on at least two iPhone models in 2025, including the iPhone SE 4.

Another huge drawback of the iPhone SE models was battery life. Since the most affordable iPhone has traditionally used a smaller body, it was to be expected that the battery life would be below average.

Fortunately, with the bigger body that the new iPhone SE 4 is supposedly going to have, Apple will have room to add a larger battery.

According to rumors, the new iPhone SE 4 will feature the same battery as the iPhone 14, which is around 3,279 mAh. Yes, it's not the biggest battery on a smartphone, but the iPhone 14 had solid battery life when it first came out, and we expect the iPhone SE to be the same.

The biggest selling point of the iPhone SE is that it's cheaper than the higher-end iPhones. Granted, it might not be considered a budget-friendly iPhone for many people, but at least it's a cheaper model than a $1,000 iPhone.

If the rumors are true, the new iPhone SE will continue to be more affordable. The current iPhone SE starts at $429, and speculators say that Apple might keep the same price for the next generation iPhone SE.

With that said, Apple might increase the price, but rumors say that Apple wants to keep the iPhone SE under the $500 price tag. If that's true, we should expect the new iPhone SE to increase its price to $499 at most.

As for the release date, everything points out that Apple will launch the new iPhone SE in the first quarter of 2025.

While we don't know exactly when it's coming, Apple launched every one of its prior iPhone SE models in March or April, so we expect it to do the same with this new model.

As you can see, the upcoming iPhone SE 4 will have some of the most significant changes we've seen on a specific iPhone model since the introduction of the iPhone X.

Of course, since everything we know about the new iPhone SE is just rumors, you should take it with a grain of salt. We won't know how many rumors are true until Apple launches the new iPhone. We'll have to wait until 2025 to see what this new budget iPhone is capable of.

iPhone 17系列12项新功能汇总 标准版迎来重大升级,"iPhone 17系列12项新功能汇总 标准版迎来重大升级

【CNMO科技】苹果的iPhone开发路线图已经规划到未来几年，公司持续与供应商就多个连续的iPhone型号进行合作，这也是为什么我们有时会提前得到有关功能泄露的传闻。iPhone 17系列也不例外 -- -- 我们已经对苹果2025年的智能手机阵容有了一定的了解。

如果你打算跳过今年的iPhone 16，或者只是对即将推出的产品感到好奇，这里有12项传闻中的功能，预计会在其继任者iPhone 17系列上推出。该系列可能会在2025年9月发布。

1、iPhone 17 ""Air""

据The Information报道，苹果计划推出一款设计""明显更薄""的全新iPhone 17机型。苹果分析师郭明錤表示，这款设备可能被称为"" iPhone 17 Air ""，据称将进行""重大重新设计""，可能包括一个位于设备顶部中央的单后置摄像头，以及一个更窄的动态岛。然而，有传言称电池厚度约为6mm，这意味着设备本身的厚度将超过这个数字。

iPhone17Air假想图

作为参考，苹果有史以来最薄的iPhone是iPhone 6，厚度为6.9mm，这意味着iPhone 17 ""Air""可能与2014年的旗舰机型相比并没有太大差别。据传该设备的显示屏尺寸为6.5英寸，可能会取代iPhone 17 Plus型号，但这一点尚未得到证实。其他潜在功能包括铝制机身、A19芯片、苹果设计的5G调制解调器和改进的前摄像头。

2、全新全铝设计：所有iPhone 17型号

据报道，苹果公司计划在iPhone 17系列中将所有设备重新采用铝制机身。两款旗舰iPhone 17 Pro型号将标志着，自苹果开始区分Pro和非Pro型号以来，高端iPhone首次回归铝制框架。近年来，铝制框架一直保留给低端设备，如iPhone SE和iPhone 16，而高端型号则采用不锈钢框架，直到iPhone 15 Pro引入钛金属框架作为一项重大升级。iPhone 17系列在材料上的这一转变标志着一种统一的方法，铝制框架将在整个设备范围内回归。

3、矩形相机凸起：iPhone 17 Pro系列

据传iPhone 17 Pro机型将采用铝和玻璃相结合的新后部设计。背面的上半部分将由铝制成，并采用铝制成的""矩形相机凸块""，而不是传统的3D玻璃。下半部分仍将是玻璃，以实现无线充电。

虽然苹果自2017年推出iPhone 8和iPhone X以来一直使用玻璃后盖，但早期的iPhone型号（除 iPhone 3G、iPhone 3GS 和iPhone 5C除外）均采用铝制后盖。此外，据The Information报道，iPhone 17 Pro上的铝制摄像头凸起将比之前的型号更大。

4、新的显示尺寸：iPhone 17和iPhone 17 Plus

今年的iPhone 16 Pro和iPhone 16 Pro Max的显示屏尺寸更大，分别从6.12英寸和6.69英寸增加到6.27英寸和6.86英寸。到2025年，苹果预计还将为其标准iPhone机型带来更大的6.27英寸显示屏尺寸，而同等的""iPhone 17 Plus""机型（暂时称为""iPhone 17 Air""）可能会采用全新的显示屏尺寸。

5、120Hz ProMotion（常亮显示）：iPhone 17和iPhone 17 Plus

苹果计划在2025年将ProMotion扩展到所有iPhone机型，允许所有机型在必要时提升至120Hz刷新率，以实现更流畅的滚动和视频内容。此前，苹果iPhone系列中只有""Pro""型号具备该功能。值得注意的是，ProMotion技术还将使iPhone 17和iPhone 17""Air""的显示屏能够降低到更节能的刷新率，低至1Hz，从而支持常亮显示功能，即使在设备锁定时也能显示锁屏时钟、小部件、通知和壁纸。

6、苹果设计的WiFi 7芯片：iPhone 17 Pro系列

苹果2025年的高端机型预计将首次配备苹果设计的Wi-Fi 7芯片。 Wi-Fi 7支持将允许""Pro""型号通过支持的路由器同时通过2.4GHz、5GHz和6GHz频段发送和接收数据，从而实现更快的Wi-Fi速度、更低的延迟和更可靠的连接。 Wi-Fi芯片还将使苹果进一步减少对博通等外部供应商的依赖，博通目前为苹果提供iPhone的Wi-Fi和蓝牙组合芯片。

7、48MP长焦镜头：iPhone 17 Pro Max

苹果最大的高端设备上升级的4800万像素长焦镜头预计将优化以配合苹果Vision Pro头显使用。这将使2025年的""Pro Max""成为首款后置摄像头系统全部由4800万像素镜头组成的iPhone，使其能够捕捉到更多的摄影细节。

8、24MP自拍镜头：所有iPhone 17机型

据传闻称，iPhone 17系列将配备24MP前置摄像头和六元件镜头。作为参考，iPhone 14和15配备12MP前置摄像头和五个塑料镜头元件，今年的iPhone 16系列也配备相同的硬件。 iPhone 17的分辨率则升级至24MP，即使在裁剪或放大时照片也能保持其质量，而更多的像素将捕捉更精细的细节。升级到六片镜头也应该会略微提高图像质量。

9、防刮抗反射显示屏：所有iPhone 17型号

根据一则传闻，iPhone 17将配备一种比iPhone 15系列上苹果陶瓷盾更防刮的抗反射显示屏。尽管新款iPhone 16 Pro型号确实采用了最新一代的陶瓷盾，其先进配方比其他任何智能手机上的玻璃都坚固2倍。但据说iPhone 17的外层玻璃有一个'超级硬抗反射层'，更加防刮。目前尚不清楚苹果是否计划采用三星在其Galaxy S24 Ultra中使用的大猩猩玻璃装甲，但康宁最新技术的描述与这一传闻相符。

10、更多内存：iPhone 17 Pro系列

苹果iPhone 17系列中至少有一款机型将配备12GB内存。投资公司海通的Jeff Pu声称，两款Pro型号都将配备升级的RAM，而苹果分析师郭明錤认为只有iPhone 17 Pro Max会配备12GB。相比之下，另一个可靠消息源声称所有iPhone 17型号都将拥有12GB的RAM。

作为对比，标准版iPhone 15和iPhone 15 Plus配备6GB的RAM，而iPhone 15 Pro型号配备8GB的RAM，所有iPhone 16型号都配备了8GB的RAM。任何此类增加都将允许在iPhone上进行更好的多任务处理，并为需要驻留在内存中的大语言模型的Apple Intelligence功能提供额外资源。

11、较小的灵动岛：iPhone 17 Pro Max

Jeff Pu表示，苹果2025年最高端iPhone将采用更窄的动态岛，这要归功于该设备的Face ID系统采用了更小的""超透镜""。传统iPhone摄像头采用曲面镜头，可将光线重新导向图像传感器，而超透镜是一种薄而扁平的镜头，其上蚀刻有微观图案，可以更精确地聚焦光线。假设这会导致动态岛变窄，这将是苹果自2022年在iPhone 14 Pro上推出该功能以来首次更改该功能。

苹果通常每年都会使用更快、更高效的芯片技术来升级iPhone。虽然预计iPhone 17系列不会采用台积电的下一代2纳米芯片，但苹果的A19芯片技术很可能会基于升级的3纳米工艺构建。 iPhone 17 Pro和iPhone 17 Pro Max预计将配备A19 Pro芯片，而iPhone 17和iPhone 17 Air可能配备标准A19芯片。

台积电正在研发N3P工艺，预计将于2024年底开始量产，因此预计苹果将在iPhone 17系列中使用这种芯片技术。与早期版本的3nm芯片相比，N3P芯片可以提供更高的性能效率和更高的晶体管密度。

总结

总结来看，明年iPhone 17系列或将推出一款更薄的机型iPhone 17 ""Air""，可能取代iPhone 17 Plus。其中，iPhone 17和iPhone 17 ""Air""可能会采用全新的铝制机身、新的显示尺寸、120Hz ProMotion、24MP自拍镜头、防刮抗反射显示屏和A19芯片。

iPhone 17 Pro和iPhone 17 Pro Max除了采用全新的铝制框架，预计还将有一个由铝制成的""更大的矩形相机凸起""，还将采用苹果下一代A19 Pro芯片、苹果设计的Wi-Fi 7芯片、24MP前置摄像头、48MP后置长焦摄像头、防刮抗反射显示屏以及12GB RAM。预计iPhone 17 Pro Max还将配备更小的动态岛。",新浪财经,https://finance.sina.com.cn/tech/roll/2024-12-02/doc-incyanhk5378535.shtml,2024-12-03,

"iPad mini 7 review: Tiny tablet, mighty potential","iPad mini 7 represents a giant leap in performance, but is it the right choice for you over its M-series counterparts? Read on to find out.

Powerful things do come in small packages, and the iPad Mini 7 is a prime example. It's hands down the most powerful compact tablet on the planet. Whether you're editing videos in Final Cut Pro or crafting designs in Procreate, the iPad mini 7 handles it all with ease, going toe-to-toe with its M-series siblings. In fact, I didn't encounter a single task where the mini lagged behind the iPad Air M2. Powered by the A17 Pro -- Apple's 3-nm chipset, which also runs last year's iPhone 15 Pro -- the iPad mini 7 is a great value at ₹49,900 in India. It's the most affordable way to experience Apple Intelligence, and its portability makes it an ideal choice for while you are on the go. In some ways, it might even be better suited for gaming than the higher-end iPads. The iPad mini 7 caters to a unique group of users and fits a lot of use cases. In this review, I'll take you through my first impressions after switching from a 13-inch iPad Air M2.

Let me start by saying that I used the iPad mini as I would my iPad Air M2. I was doing everything that I do on my iPad Air -- including editing short videos on Lumafusion and Final Cut Pro, alongside creating thumbnails on a day-to-day basis in Procreate. I was also editing raw images using Adobe Lightroom. Now, you would think that being the A17 Pro, it would perform slightly inferior to, let's say, the M series silicon that you typically find in the iPad Air and the iPad Pro range. But I'm happy to report that in real-world scenarios, I have noticed barely any difference.

Yes, the export times in apps like LumaFusion were just barely higher than what you would find on the M2 iPad Air, but it's so negligible that it's not jarring at all. In fact, I did a side-by-side comparison of exporting the same 4K video in LumaFusion. The iPad Air took 14 seconds to export, while the iPad mini 7 took around 17. This is just a minor difference and shouldn't be a point of concern for anyone.

The A17 Pro is a champ, and by no means a weak processor. Even in apps like Procreate, I had no problem creating thumbnails. The multi-layered workflow was smooth, and there was basically no tangible difference that I felt compared to using Procreate on the iPad mini versus the iPad Air M2.

When it comes to battery life, you would think that it would be inferior compared to the iPad Air as well, right? Because of the smaller form factor and the smaller battery. Well, it isn't entirely the right assumption to make because the iPad mini 7's 5078 mAh battery lasts a full day and beyond. In fact, I would say it's just slightly inferior compared to the iPad Air 13-inch model. It is so little different that you would be hard-pressed to notice a difference, really.

That being said, your battery life depends on what you do on your iPad. If you're just reading ebooks or watching YouTube, your battery life would be great. But if you're doing performance-intensive tasks, such as playing Resident Evil 4 or other AAA games, thanks to the A17 Pro chipset, or editing heavy files in Lightroom, then the battery life can take a hit. But it's true for other iPads as well, so you're not losing out on anything as such. On a full charge, in a realistic scenario with mixed usage involving editing thumbnails in Procreate, editing a short video for around 30 minutes, and watching a lot of YouTube and Amazon Prime, the tablet lasted us a full working day. Typically, I would end with around 15 to 20 per cent remaining by the end of the day. On the days when I was not editing anything, the tablet would easily last me two full days. That is stellar battery life.

And when it comes to gaming, while the performance is great but what's better is the ease with which you can play games. I feel the 11"" and 13"" models are too large for most games, and iPad mini strikes just the right balance. I thoughly enjoyed my time playing Stardew Valley on the iPad mini 7 -- something I can't say for the larger models.

When I first reviewed the iPad Air M2 and Apple Pencil Pro, I was fondly surprised by the little things that the Apple Pencil Pro brought, which made the overall experience of using it so much more enjoyable than the Apple Pencil 2nd generation, which I was using with the previous generation iPad Air. Right from how the barrel rotate feature works to how you get haptic feedback when you do little actions like double-tapping on the pencil to change tools -- it's just a more enjoyable and immersive experience. It still holds true. I said the same thing when I reviewed the iPad Air M2 (iPad Air M2 review), and I'll say it again.

These changes make for a way better experience for people like artists and editors. Features like barrel roll, which uses the inbuilt gyroscope to rotate brushes in apps like Procreate, and, of course, Apple Pencil hover is also another big addition. You get to see where exactly your brush will hit, and this increases precision.

That said, the Apple Pencil Pro is exactly the same as the Apple Pencil 2nd generation in terms of design, so some might be confused when the 2nd generation pencil does not pair with the iPad mini 7. The magnet placement is different, and for several other reasons, you can't pair a 2nd generation Apple Pencil with the iPad mini 7. So your only option now is to either get the Apple Pencil Pro or the Apple Pencil with USB-C.

The iPad mini 7's display is not an OLED or a mini LED panel. In fact, the display is exactly the same as the last generation iPad mini 6. It's a Liquid Retina display with a resolution of 2266 pixels by 1488 pixels, which makes for around 326 pixels per inch. The peak brightness also isn't impressive by any means, coming in at 500 nits. And of course, because the panel is the same, you don't get a high refresh rate as well. That being said, this IPS panel is fantastic to look at. I would say it is one of the best IPS LCD panels you can buy in a consumer-grade device. It still holds true for the iPad Air M2, and it holds true for the iPad mini 7 as well.

I did notice some real-world differences between the iPad Air M2's IPS LCD display compared to the iPad mini 7's IPS LCD display. The first thing I noticed was that the black levels on the iPad Air M2, despite having a traditional IPS LCD display, were slightly better compared to the iPad mini 7. Also, because the iPad Air M2 supports a higher peak brightness of 600 nits, it can be more legible in direct sunlight. I experienced this while working out of a cafe one day, and while the difference isn't drastic, it is certainly noticeable. Don't get me wrong, it's a perfectly usable display that you will learn to enjoy when watching TV shows, reading ebooks, browsing the web, and of course, whatever you're supposed to do on an iPad.

It gets the job done and builds on the narrative that Apple is trying to create here, which is making an ""almost"" pro-grade experience available at entry-level pricing and on a much smaller form factor so that people who want the mini for its size don't have to compromise on power and experience. And that brings me to who the iPad mini 7 is for.

Also Read: iPhone 16 review: Solid design, performance with a few unmet expectations

Before I tell you who the iPad mini 7 is for, let's talk pricing. The iPad mini, for the base 128 GB model with Wi-Fi only, starts at ₹49,900 in India. Comparing this price to other iPads, such as the iPad Air, the iPad Air with the M2 chip comes in at ₹10,000more, at ₹59,900. By saving ₹10,000, you're getting essentially the same experience as the iPad Air. In fact, I would say the iPad mini is a smaller iPad Air.

But as things stand, price isn't something that should be a factor while choosing the iPad mini. I would say it is the form factor that should appeal to you when you choose the iPad mini. I had an interesting conversation with a friend the other day, who happens to be a commercial pilot. He told me that the iPad mini is quite a popular device in aviation simply because of its form factor. It is easily manoeuvrable in the cockpit. You can easily access your maps and other data while you are taking a flight. You can't do the same with the 11-inch or the 13-inch iPads.

Also, now that the mini is quite powerful, you don't have to compromise on much. So, what I would say is, you should get the iPad mini if you are always on the go, if you want a display that is bigger than your smartphone, and if you want more immersion out of your content consumption experiences but don't necessarily want to lug around a huge iPad. In fact, after using the iPad mini, I have started to bring it along with me more.

It's so small that I just throw it in my side carry bag and basically forget about it, only using it when I need it. But with the 13-inch iPad Air, I always have to think about it. Will I be able to use the iPad Air? Is it going to be worth carrying so much weight? So, this is a big advantage with the mini, essentially. So, if you want a lot of power in a small form factor, the iPad mini is the one you should get. And of course, if you are in aviation or a professional who requires your tablet to be small, the iPad mini becomes a non-negotiable choice.

Let me start by saying that the iPad mini is built no less than the iPad Pro. It has the same premium glass and aluminium construction that we have learned to expect from Apple. The finish is top-notch. The device feels solid, and it's just a premium tablet to hold. That being said, it does carry the exact same design from the last generation, which launched almost three years ago in 2021.

So while a design change would have been welcome, Apple chose to go with the old design of the iPad mini 6. I do think that the bezel size on the iPad mini could be reduced a bit. It is the same size as the iPad Air M2, but on the iPad Air, it's less noticeable because the overall display footprint is larger. But on the iPad mini's 8.3-inch panel, the bezels can look a bit dated. Here's to hoping that Apple shrinks the bezels, making the iPad mini even more compact while offering the same display size. It would be a dream come true.

That said, it does come in fresh new finishes now, which happen to be a new Blue and a new Purple, and it joins the existing Space Grey and Starlight colours. Like before, you can always pick the free engraving option that Apple offers in India to personalise your iPad.

The iPad mini has two stereo speakers, similar to the iPad Air and the 10th generation iPad. Yes, you don't get four speakers like the iPad Pro, but that's okay because the sound quality you can extract out of this tiny device is great. The sound, while not as loud as the iPad Air, is full-sounding, with a good balance. It offers a good enough experience overall. It is also loud enough so that you can use the iPad mini in loud environments. But of course, you shouldn't use the iPad mini on an airplane, blurting out your audio. But in situations where using the speaker is not negotiable, the iPad mini will actually be just fine.

While the 12MP ultra-wide front-facing camera is excellent for things like FaceTime and just taking selfies, it misses out on the placement that you get with the iPad Air. It still lays sideways, unlike the iPad Air, which gets it right and places the camera on the side bezel. Also, it cannot record 4K video; it caps out at 1080P up to 60 FPS.

On the other hand, the rear-facing camera is excellent at 12MP. It comes with all the features you would expect, including Smart HDR, Burst mode, the ability to capture images in either HEIF or JPEG, and even 4K video recording at up to 60 FPS. Plus, you also have continuous autofocus, video stabilisation at all resolutions, and a True Tone flash, which happens to be missing on models like the iPad Air. I guess because of the portable form factor the iPad mini offers, Apple wants you to take more pictures with it. I mean, I have no use for it, but I'm sure someone else does.

Another thing I would like to point out is the omission of support for the Apple Pencil 2. A lot of people who are upgrading from older iPads still have those pencils lying around. It is the same for other iPads as well, but not having Apple Pencil 2 support isn't the right thing, in my opinion. It practically makes old Apple Pencils electronic waste.

Coming to the elephant in the room, yes, the iPad mini happens to be the cheapest way possible to experience Apple's generative AI, which it calls Apple Intelligence. You get the whole suite of features that are available currently, including writing tools, Clean Up in the Photos app, which lets you erase objects, the brand new Siri experience, which is much smarter now, and notification summaries, which can indeed come in quite handy.

I would say, to say the least, the experience is just starting to build. There's not a lot you can do at the moment, but iPadOS 18.2 is on the horizon now that December is here. With the update, the iPad mini will get several new features, including Genmoji, Image Playground, ChatGPT integration, and more. This will make the experience more complete and well-rounded.

So, if you have been wanting to try out Apple Intelligence but don't want to splurge on something like the iPhone 16 or an iPad with an M series processor, the iPad mini will be a compelling device at ₹49,900.

If you are in the market for a compact tablet that does everything a tablet is supposed to do and beyond, without skipping a beat, the iPad mini is the de facto choice; it has been the de facto choice for a while now, and the iPad mini 7, with its latest A17 Pro chipset and support for Apple Intelligence, only doubles down on this lead. You can't go wrong with the iPad mini 7. For ₹49,900, Apple has actually made quite a value-for-money device. Yes, the design is not fresh, and the front-facing camera placement could have been better, but these can be ignored for the experience you get at large.",Hindustan Times Tech,https://tech.hindustantimes.com/mobile/reviews/ipad-mini-7-review-tiny-tablet-mighty-potential-71733230897745.html,2024-12-03,
Apple iPhone 16 Pro review: The 'Pro'-mise of perfect performance - Times of India,"The iPhone 16 Pro offers a premium Apple experience with a compact design, featuring the new A18 Bionic chip, a larger 6.3-inch OLED Super Retina XDR display, and an enhanced triple camera system. With upgraded software on iOS 18, including new apps and customisation options, it is a solid, practical upgrade for users.The iPhone 16 Pro is meant for those who want the premium Apple experience without lugging around a phone that is perhaps too big. In a world where screens keep getting bigger, the iPhone 16 Pro proves you don't need to sacrifice comfort for power. It's compact, lightweight, and has all the high-end performance and premium features that Apple's Pro models are known for. Apple has upped the ante with the A18 Bionic chip under the hood. While the iPhone 16 Pro Max might get all the hype for its size and battery life, the Pro stands its ground, proving that great things really do come in smaller packages.

After thoroughly exploring Apple's latest offering, here is our detailed review to help you decide whether the Apple iPhone 16 Pro is worth your money or not

The iPhone 16 Pro builds upon Apple's signature design language, blending sleek aesthetics with durability. The titanium frame, introduced in the iPhone 15 Pro, remains but is now lighter and more durable. The flat edges and matte glass back provide excellent grip and a premium feel. The device is available in a fresh range of colours which include -- Black Titanium, brighter White Titanium, natural Titanium, and a new Desert Titanium. We got the Natural Titanium colour and we absolutely loved it.

Despite the large display size, the phone is quite light in weight and easy to use with one hand. The company has retained the Action button introduced in last year's iPhone 15 Pro models. Along with this, Apple has also introduced the Camera Control button placed on the right side panel along with the power button. The Camera Control button enables you to quickly launch the camera, take a photo, and start video recording.

You will find the volume buttons and the action button placed on the left side of the smartphone. The button part houses the USB Type-C charging port and the stereo speakers. The iPhone 16 Pro Max features a seamless, single piece of glass on its back, sporting a matte finish that elegantly contrasts with the glossy Apple logo and the camera housing.

The square camera module includes three high-end cameras, a LiDAR scanner, an LED flash, and a microphone. The iPhone 16 Pro offers sufficient grip for those who prefer to go case-free. The smartphone boasts of an impressive build which will be liked by many. Its IP68 water and dust resistance offers peace of mind for daily usage, making it a robust companion for all conditions.

The iPhone 16 Pro display has rounded corners that follow a beautiful curved design. The smartphone features a 6.3-inch OLED Super Retina XDR display with 1206x2622 pixel resolution. This year Apple has increased the screen size of the Pro models.

The iPhone 16 Pro's display grows from 6.1 inches to 6.3 inches and the company claims that the Super Retina XDR display with Always-On and ProMotion technologies helps users accomplish more. Apple has not only increased the size but also enhanced the Ceramic Shield on the display.

Apple says that the latest-generation Ceramic Shield features an advanced formulation, making it twice as tough as the glass on any other smartphone. The OLED panel offers brighter peak brightness at 2000 nits, making it perfect for outdoor use even under direct sunlight. Colours are vivid, blacks are deep, and the 120Hz refresh rate ensures smooth scrolling and an immersive viewing experience.

The iPhone 16 Pro truly shines when it comes to HDR and 4K content. Whether you're watching HD videos on YouTube or indulging in a binge-watching session on Netflix, the level of detail and visual quality is simply astounding. Apple's latest iPhone delivers an immersive viewing experience that's hard to beat.

Apple has also included a smaller Dynamic Island, which now supports even more app integrations, making multitasking easier and notifications more intuitive. With minimal bezels, the display feels expansive and futuristic. Also, the always-on display provides quick access to information without waking the device.

Apple iPhone 16 Pro is powered by Apple's own A18 Pro chipset. This new chip from Apple is built with second-generation 3-nanometer technology and features a new architecture with smaller, faster transistors. Apple claims that the A18 Pro chipset is 20% faster as compared to the previous generation. During our testing, the A18 Pro chip on iPhone 16 Pro delivered blazing-fast performance. The chipset manages to handle demanding apps, gaming and multitasking effortlessly.

The iPhone 16 Pro also introduces a faster Neural Engine, enabling more advanced on-device processing for tasks like voice recognition, photo editing, and augmented reality. We also tested several games on high settings, including Genshin Impact, Asphalt 9, and Call of Duty Mobile. All the games ran without any lags or issues.

Also, Apple's new Game Mode in iOS 18 enhances the gaming experience on the iPhone 16 Pro. The audio performance of the iPhone 16 Pro is truly remarkable. Equipped with spatial audio and Dolby Atmos support, the phone delivers immersive and rich sound quality. Whether you're listening to music, watching movies, or playing games, the stereo speakers produce clear and balanced audio with deep bass and crisp highs.

Turning to software, the iPhone 16 Pro runs the iOS 18 operating system. This latest version offers extensive personalisation options across the home screens, allowing users to infuse a personal touch into the UI, making it truly unique. iOS 18 also introduces a couple of new apps, such as Passwords, Journal, and an improved Calculator. Along with this, the company has also redesigned the Photos app.

The lockscreen on iOS 18 retains its familiar design with the Notification Center, housing your notifications along with shortcuts for the torch and camera. Like the earlier iOS version, you can customise the clock and widgets on the lockscreen and also customise your wallpaper. Along with this, you now have the option to replace the two shortcuts at the bottom with nearly anything you desire, including custom shortcuts created through the Shortcuts app. Apple has also revamped the Control Centre with iOS 18. Now, it supports multiple pages and provides a wide variety of toggles and widgets.

You can also place widgets on any of the home screens and can also stack widgets of the same size on top of one another. The latest version of the operating system also allows icon customisation. You now have the option to enlarge app icons and hide their names, select an accent colour for all icons and toggle between light and dark themes. iOS 18 also enhances user-friendliness by allowing you to lock apps with Face ID, providing an extra layer of security and privacy.

Let's quickly talk about the Action Button which the company introduced last year in iPhone 15 Pro models. Now all the models of the iPhone 16 series come with Action Button which can be activated with a long press. It comes with several predefined actions, such as silencer, torch, magnifier, camera shortcut and more.

Apple introduced the much-talked Apple Intelligence features with iOS 18. Apple claims that Apple Intelligence maintains the privacy and security of user data with Private Cloud Compute. In the Notes and Phone apps, users can also record, transcribe, and summarise audio. When a recording is initiated while on a call in the Phone app, participants are automatically notified, and once the call ends, Apple Intelligence generates a summary to recall key points.

Apple Intelligence helps users prioritise with summarised notifications, along with Priority Messages in Mail, a feature that understands the content of emails and surfaces time-sensitive messages. Across a user's inbox, summaries convey the most important information of each email instead of previewing the first few lines. You can read about the complete Apple Intelligence features in our Apple Intelligence guide.

The iPhone 16 Pro boasts a larger battery, offering an impressive battery performance. With optimisations in the A18 Pro chip and iOS 18, power efficiency is exceptional. During our testing, the iPhone 16 Pro managed to offer more than a day's battery backup on a single charge. The smartphone also comes with fast charging support and we managed to charge 59% of the smartphone in 30 minutes using a fast charger.

The iPhone 16 Pro's camera system is impressive and extremely versatile. The Apple iPhone 16 Pro sports a triple rear camera setup which comprises 48MP Fusion camera with f/1.78 aperture, 48MP ultra wide camera with f/2.2 aperture and 12MP telephoto camera with f/2.8 aperture. The telephoto lens comes with 5x zoom capability and the smartphone also houses a 12MP front camera.

To begin with, Apple introduced the innovative Camera Control button with the iPhone 16 series. Placed on the right side of the smartphone, the Camera Control button is a new way to quickly launch the camera, take a photo, and start video recording. It has a tactile switch that powers the click experience, a high-precision force sensor that enables the light press gesture, and a capacitive sensor that allows for touch interactions. A new camera preview helps users frame the shot and adjust other control options -- such as zoom, exposure, or depth of field -- to compose a stunning photo or video by sliding their finger on the Camera Control.

Once you are in the camera app, a click on the Camera Control button will take a photo, whereas holding down the button will start recording a video. Along with this, you can also tweak the parameters of the camera with the help of the button. You can adjust the zoom level, exposure compensation and more.

Apple also introduced Photographic Styles in the camera this time. Photographic Styles help users express their creativity and customise their photos by locally adjusting colour, highlights, and shadows in real time. The Photographic Styles are divided into two categories -- undertones and mood. Users can apply these photographic styles both while capturing a picture and after taking the shot. We really liked the additional layer of customisability as it enabled users to personalise the world around them and have that perfect shot.

When it comes to image quality, Apple continues to impress with its overall results. The camera captures stunning details, vibrant colours, and accurate white balance. The dynamic range is impressive, handling both highlights and shadows effortlessly. On the other hand, the larger sensor and advanced image processing algorithms allow the iPhone 16 Pro to capture impressive low-light photos with minimal noise and excellent detail.

Like always, the Portrait mode will leave you impressed. Images captured in the portrait mode deliver beautiful bokeh effects and accurate subject separation. The advanced depth sensing capabilities allow for precise edge detection and realistic blur. The telephoto camera on the iPhone 16 Pro performs really well and the shots taken in 5x optical zoom manage to capture great amounts of detail.

The Apple iPhone 16 Pro is capable of recording video at up to 4K60 with all of its cameras, including the three rear cameras and the front-facing one. Along with this, users can also capture 4K120 fps in Slo-mo or Video mode, and adjust the playback speed after capture in the Photos app, including a quarter-speed playback, a new half-speed option for a dreamy effect, and a fifth-speed option that corresponds to 24 fps.

When coupled with the new image signal processor (ISP) of A18 Pro, users can do frame-by-frame cinema-quality colour grading for 4K120 fps in Dolby Vision. The videos captured during daylight turned out very impressive. The video captured excellent detailing with no noticeable noise. The video stabilisation on the iPhone 16 Pro is impressive and it ensures that you capture smooth and steady footage.

Another talked about feature of iPhone 16 Pro is the Audio Mix functionality. iPhone 16 Pro features four new studio-quality mics which promises to capture better sound during video recording. Returning to Audio Mix, this feature lets users adjust the sound post-capture to emphasise the voice of the person on camera, make the audio sound as if it was recorded in a professional studio, or position vocal tracks at the forefront while placing environmental noises in surround sound. Audio Mix uses machine learning to identify and separate background elements from speech, giving users three voice options: In-Frame Mix, Studio Mix, and Cinematic Mix. We really liked the feature and audio quality of the videos captured on the phone.

The iPhone 16 Pro is as impressive as it comes. It's a practical companion for work, creativity, and entertainment. With a sharp display, a powerful processor, and a versatile camera system, it stands out as one of the best options in the market. Improved battery life and the iOS experience add to its appeal, making it a reliable choice for daily use.

Features like Camera Control, Audio Mix, and the ability to shoot 4K video at 120 fps elevate its functionality, especially for those who value high-quality video and audio production. While it doesn't reinvent the wheel compared to its predecessor, the iPhone 16 Pro refines the experience with thoughtful upgrades.

For anyone using an older model or wanting Apple's latest innovations packed into a compact, capable device, the iPhone 16 Pro feels like a solid, practical upgrade.",The Times of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/reviews/apple-iphone-16-pro-review-the-pro-mise-of-perfect-performance/articleshow/115930334.cms,2024-12-03,

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Wells Fargo's Top Tech Stocks to Beat the S&P,"WF points out that while these incidents are concerning, other factors will also determine AI's wider acceptability and use. Broadly speaking, these factors are growing energy requirements and capital expenditure costs, global geopolitical tensions, model inaccuracies, and regulatory constraints. The bank adds that these factors are also accompanied by the potentially transformative effect of AI on the labor market. Starting from its beliefs about the labor market, WF believes that generative AI, which is different from other AI systems such as machine learning, will have a more ""nuanced"" impact on the labor market compared to traditional AI. Commenting on common worries of AI taking jobs away, the bank outlines that the jobs that AI will replace will in turn be replaced by new jobs created by AI. To quote WF, it believes ""generative AI's disruptive effect on the labor market to mirror other forms of automation -- as in the past, its impact likely will be mitigated over time by new occupations spawned by the innovations themselves.""

To help bolster its claim, WF shares data from MIT. It points out that MIT's estimates show that ""60% of U.S. workers are now employed in occupations that did not exist 84 years ago."" As for which job functions might give way to AI, these include knowledge-based roles such as those found in financial services and support roles such as those performed by customer support agents.

Two additional key disruptive AI effects that Wall Street in particular is keenly aware of are its rising costs and the effect on the utility industry. The S&P's utility sector is up by 28.36% year-to-date which leads the broader index's 26.48% in gains by nearly two percentage points. Commenting on this, the bank believes that ""there will be a significant increase in hardware demand, notably within the data-center environment, to accommodate the substantial increase in AI workloads,"" adding that ""it may take a number of years to increase the operational efficiency of various large language models and decrease costs to a level more in-line with existing search engines."" WF also shares that while existing opportunities to expand data center footprint to accommodate AI are present, as they ""diminish, companies may revisit existing data-center locations to retrofit and upgrade hardware and infrastructure in support of the power and data-consumption needs of new AI technologies.""

Given the criticality of the data center space to AI, WF expands on this sector in another report. Titled 'Generative AI transforming data center landscape"" it comments on the capital expenditure required to set up data centers, future trends for data centers, and the stock market sectors that might benefit from growing interest and focus on the data center industry. According to its analysis, investor attention is mostly focused on AI-related investments in semiconductors and cloud computing.

However, other sectors, such as ""cabling; steel racks; cooling (liquid and air); electrical equipment (both inside and outside the box); and backup generators"" are also important. WF quotes a utility company to explain why these tertiary sectors are critical in the AI wave. It shares that utility company believes that ""the server rack power density required to train a generative-AI-based large language model can require up to five to seven times more power than server racks used for traditional IT workloads in a data center.""

While semiconductor companies are natural beneficiaries of the AI boom, some oft-ignored sectors that WF mentions are industrials and materials. It outlines that when it comes to building massive data centers, estimates suggest ""that approximately 35% - 45% of the cost is related to land, building shell, and basic building fit-out. These areas are addressable by companies who supply steel, aggregates, cement, and water equipment and, by extension, construction and engineering firms as well as broad non-residential construction suppliers (such as industrial distributors)."" Additionally, ""40% - 45% and 15% - 20% of the remaining cost can be attributed to electrical and HVAC systems respectively,"" according to Wells Fargo. AI is having an effect on materials, as per the bank, in the form of ""increased demand for materials that are used in the production of semiconductor chips, water handling and recycling within data centers, and steel and construction materials to build data centers.""

Our Methodology

To make our list of Wells Fargo's top AI & non-AI stocks that can outpace the flagship S&P, we selected technology-focused stocks from the bank's recent Focus List and ranked them by their consensus next twelve-month EPS estimates.

For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).

A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer electronics firm in the world. A global beast, it earned a whopping $296 billion in revenue during the nine months ending in June 2024. Out of this, 52% or $155 billion came from the iconic iPhone smartphone. As a result, the iPhone is baked into Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s hypothesis, and it is the most important determinant of the firm's hypothesis. Investors rely on the firm's ability to regularly launch updates to the smartphone and ensure that its 1.46 billion iPhone users regularly update their smartphones. Another key part of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s hypothesis is its second-largest business called Services. Through this business, the firm earns revenue from companies like Google which pay it billions of dollars to make their services the default on the iOS platform. Consequently, any regulatory actions against this could deal Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) a blow. Over the long term, the firm's design strength and brand image can prove to be valuable moats that also enable it to push artificial intelligence services to consumers.

Columbia Threadneedle Investments mentioned Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:

""Shares of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) increased during the quarter after reporting quarterly results in August that met or exceeded expectations. The company also benefited from holding an investor event in September to introduce the newest iteration of products and accessories. Apple introduced the latest iteration of its flagship model, the iPhone 16, which features updated hardware and a refreshed operating system that integrates AI but will be exclusive to newer iPhone models, which could compel a refresh cycle. The gradual introduction of AI into the Apple product ecosystem is consistent with the company's historical fast follower approach and represents a new tenant of the investment thesis as the market awaits further information related to the company's AI strategy.""

Overall, AAPL ranks 10th on our list of Wells Fargo's tech stocks to beat the S&P: 14 top AI & non-AI stocks. AAPL is a top cyclical stock Wells Fargo is confident about. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.
